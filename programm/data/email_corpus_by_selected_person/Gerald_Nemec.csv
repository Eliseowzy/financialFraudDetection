Gerald Nemec PM To Dan J NRON cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Barbara Gray Teresa G CT Subject Re Summary of Tom Brown Meeting Confidential Work Product Attorney Client Privilege Dan Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution As the situation stands now Wildhorses possible responses to the letter are as follows Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment If they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo one of which is release of the gas You are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives That is a risk I pointed out early However in our letter to Wildhorse I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of weeks If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice A Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract This will take time Depending on court docket loads months to year B Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by Wildhorse and that we will build our own system Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms The only complication is that under the contract Wildhorses obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream Depending on Wildhorses flow dynamics and our plant placement Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas After your field meeting and our engineering assessment hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal I would very directly ask them under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees They dont have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability Dan J NRON PM To Gerald CT cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Subject Summary of Tom Brown Meeting I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today I met with the Business Development Director Bob Mustard Tom Brown as owner of Wildhorse is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems quality pressure et al currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo and other producers low Btu gas they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology I passed all this info on to KenJim Heres the interesting partBob discussed confidentially that for the past monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buyout of Kinder Morgans interest in Wildhorse they have a righttomatch provision in their LLC agreement The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt Kinder Evans If they are successful which he thinks TBI will be then TBI will turnaround and look to spin off the nonstrategic systems like the Piceance Basin assets to third party purchasers This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with WildhorseWildhorse has been slowplaying negotiations since I first met with them in late May and above may be the reason why Now that weve sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting essentially to clarify their understanding status of the contracts so we can get to work my feeling based on the transaction between KMI TBI is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete how much longer will this take Of course if the transaction is completed TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system so even if ENA is interested will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested The point is thisIm anticipating a generic noncommital response to Crescendos letter from Wildhorse Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out Im off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse Ill keep you informed of any developments Thanks Dan,nemec-g,

NRON cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Barbara Gray Teresa G CT Subject Re Summary of Tom Brown Meeting Confidential Work Product Attorney Client Privilege Dan Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution As the situation stands now Wildhorses possible responses to the letter are as follows Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment If they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo one of which is release of the gas You are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives That is a risk I pointed out early However in our letter to Wildhorse I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of weeks If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice A Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract This will take time Depending on court docket loads months to year B Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by Wildhorse and that we will build our own system Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms The only complication is that under the contract Wildhorses obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream Depending on Wildhorses flow dynamics and our plant placement Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas After

because I at one time worked at the Posse doesnt mean my character should continue to be called into question Davis NRON COMMUNICATIONS AM To Gerald CT cc Brian HendonEnron nron Communications Subject The True Fan Gerald got a copy of this and thought you might need to see it Margaret just so that you get a proper understanding of who I work with rumor has it that Gerald used to work at the Posse Fan on Game Day This is pretty long but its HYSTERICAL If youve ever been drunk at a sporting event or been with someone who has you can relate This is an email from some guy named JD Horne Gerald Nemec who according to the messages that were attached to this is not a yearold frat boy but an attorney of indeterminate age He sent it to his friend Brian Brice and it got forwarded around the country You have to give the guy some props for being selfdeprecatingbut I hope I never meet him on game day A chronology of events for Saturday December and the early morning hours of Sunday December Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Alamodome Nebraska vs Texas Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo the Texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up he empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the basketball game TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Centermuch less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is

friend a Stupid cocksucker I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughterIve been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door

CHILI TASTER These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK who was visiting Texas from New Jersey and fell into it Recently I was lucky enough to be the th attendee at the State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cookoff Apparently the original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the call came in I was assured by the other two judges Native Texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality They assured me that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting so I accepted Here are the scorecards from the event Chili Mikes Maniac Mobster Monster Chili JUDGE ONE A little too heavy on tomato Amusing kick JUDGE TWO Nice smooth tomato flavor Very mild FRANK Holy shit what the hell is this stuff You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it Took me two beers to put the flames out Hope thats the worst one These Texans are crazy Chili Arthurs Afterburner Chili JUDGE ONE Smoky with a hint of pork Slight Jalapeno tang JUDGE TWO Exciting BBQ flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously FRANK Keep this out of reach of children Im not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver They had to walkietalkie in extra beers when they saw the look on my face Chili Freds Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili JUDGE ONE Excellent firehouse chili Great kick Needs more beans JUDGE TWO A beanless chili a bit salty good use of red peppers FRANK Call the EPA Ive located a uranium spill My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano Everyone knows the routine by now Barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest m getting shitfaced Chili Bubbas Black Magic JUDGE ONE Black bean chili with almost no spice Disappointing JUDGE TWO Hint of lime in the black beans Good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili FRANK I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it Sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that lb bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclearwaste Im eating Chili Lindas Legal Lip Remover JUDGE ONE Meaty strong chili Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick Very impressive JUDGE TWO Chili using shredded beef could use more tomato Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement FRANK My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming Screw those rednecks Chili Veras Very Vegetarian Variety JUDGE ONE Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili Good balance of spice and peppers JUDGE TWO The best yet Aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic Superb FRANK My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone Chili Susans Screaming Sensation Chili JUDGE ONE A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers JUDGE TWO Ho Hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment I should note that I am worried about Judge Number He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably FRANK You could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and I wouldnt feel a damn thing Ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth My pants are full of lavalike shit to match my damn shirt At least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me Ive decided to stop breathing its too painful Screw it Im not getting any oxygen anyway If I need air Ill just suck it in through the inch hole in my stomach Chili Helens Mount Saint Chili JUDGE ONE A perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence JUDGE TWO This final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number passed out fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself Not sure if hes going to make it Poor Yank FRANK editors note Judge was unable To report Get Your Private Free Email from MSN Hotmail at Share information about yourself create

built posh private suites at the stadium before last season In October he hosted a charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous TexasOklahoma weekend to benefit the schools sports programs He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas Stars but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns So its understandable that he was a bit on edge at the Nebraska game hosting a couple of dozen friends relatives and business associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the field at the Nebraska game Wearing a Longhorn burntorange shirt and surrounded by enough icecream bars and shrimp to satisfy an offensive line Hicks was anxious and animated Hey he yelled aint this something It sure is The University of Texas athletic program is at a pretty intriguing place in college sports With a surging young football team at its core it is one of the most successful college athletic programs in the country and Im not just talking about wins and losses This is a multimilliondollar enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a renegade campus outfit College sports has been a bigticket dance for some time now and this program is much like others at the toptier universities but there are a couple of exceptions The folks making the moves in Austin function more like CEOs than like traditional athletic directors and coaches and theyre making it work To determine how they do it I went back to school this fall and asked to take a close look at the books What I found was an operation that balances the athletic departments educational responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the costs of running a bigtime athletic program are surging and most college athletic programs are in the red I found a place where football pays the bills That was no surprise but this was Among the beneficiaries of bigtime football is a womens sports program that could be a model for gender equity In fact at the University of Texas the football Longhorns are Grade A cash cows Athletics officials credit the team with generating a staggering of the departments million from revenues in Thats million from tickets individual donations rights fees sponsorships hot dogs beer and other sources The athletic department operates much like a selfcontained corporation separate and apart from the rest of the university It has its core business football various auxiliary operations other mens and womens teams numerous revenue streams traditional corporate functions such as finance marketing public relations and HR you know it as recruiting and even sophisticated satellite officesdozens of alumni chapters nationwide through which athletics targets some Texas Exes for private gifts Got shareholders You bet More than of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays in the fall and they grade every move Mack Brown makes Think chasing quarterly expectations is brutal Try putting the success of your company in the hands of a bunch of to yearolds Hate talking to analysts Try answering Buck from Muleshoe Texas on a weekly callin talk show after losing a point lead in the fourth quarter Of course the whole thing is complicated by the fact that while a majorcollege athletic program must be managed with the diligence of a public company athletic directors dont have the luxury of shutting down unprofitable businessesat most schools that would be every sport save football and mens basketball And those wellpaid football coaches quite simply must win If we were a business we wouldnt have any sport but football and we would generate a heck of a profit says Dodds who is among the nations most respected athletic directors But were not about that We take the money we generate from football and use it to provide opportunities for other kids Then we try to balance what we want to accomplish inside the institution with what folks outside the institution want us to do Its a hard thing to do For more than a quartercentury one of the most difficult challenges for college sports has been finding a place for women Youve probably heard of Title IX the historic clause in the Education Amendments Act of that turned college sports on its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality for women in participation scholarship allocation recruitment spending and coaching resources The requirement forced athletic departments to essentially double their operations which helped spark the overall growth in college sports So whatever you think about the emphasis on college football hey it pays for womens soccer okay The Texas athletic departments budget is among the largest in the nation million for fiscal which ended in August Only four universities had fatter sports wallets that year Wisconsin million Tennessee million Michigan million and Ohio State No by far with a whopping million athletics budget If you think those who spend the most win forget it OSU is the only school of the group not ranked in the latest Top AP football poll How does UT get to its number For starters ticket sales and game guarantees payments to UT by a host school when the Longhorns play on the road generated million in revenue last year That category was exceeded only by private gifts which totaled an impressive million Other significant income categories included suitelease revenue million television money million payment for the teams Cotton Bowl appearance optional student fees sponsorships and advertising licensing revenue and concessions All told the department generated million in The athletic departments expenses totaled million That included scholarships valued at million for men and women administrative costs million for about employees and equipment purchases million The costs of running individual teams ranged from million for football to for tennis What caused the shortfall The final bills for a twoyear million capital improvement effort Remarkably the athletic department completed the project without a penny from the universitys academic funds It raised more than million in private donations in just over two years The department also took out million in bonds serviced now by lease and ticket revenues The bill was closed with million from the universitys Parking and Traffic division to fund a parking garage So what can you get for million Take a stroll down East Campus Drive near the stadium and youll pass the spiffy new million Mike A Myers Stadium and Soccer Field One block over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the country the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields million It was subsidized by yearold World War II veteran Frank A Denius a longtime fan who has attended practices most every day for as long as anyone can remember Beyond the suites at RoyalMemorial stadium UT added nearly new seats renovated major sections on both sides of the yearold facility and lowered the field three feet Why lower the field you ask I did too Better sightlines of course The stadium renovations cost million million to lower the field alone The department also spruced up its main offices now known as the MoncriefNeuhaus Complex If youve got an extra million you can get your name slapped on just about anything The place is Four Seasons plush Theres an impressive academic support center stocked with computers a hangarsized weight room that could inspire a couch potato and an overthetop football locker room any NFL team would envycustomcarved benches original art and lockers the size of small Manhattan apartments Mack Browns spacious office with a picture window overlooking the stadium field is trimmed in warm cherrywood and decorated with mementos and collectibles including a case of watches commemorating universities and bowl games where he has coached during his year career Photos from the Longhorn archives line the hallways and display cases in the lobby house the schools three national championship trophies and and the Heisman Trophy won by the man who is still the most powerful and exciting running back in college football history former Longhorn Earl Campbell Check out the intricate handcarved leather saddles in the cavernous players lounge Yep you can sit on the saddles and watch games If it all seems impossibly lavish there are reasons The stadium upgrade generates new revenue and the school had to build new facilities for its womens programs under requirements outlined in Title IX But perhaps the most vital reason is recruiting We had to stay sexy and attractive to the kids says Ed Goble UTs vice president of business affairs Youve got to provide an enhanced experience on campus to compete for the best kids CEO and COO would be more appropriate titles for Dodds and Brown the UT athletic director and head football coach Dodds a yearold former track coach got into sports administration because he liked working with coaches Today he has an associate athletic director who handles those duties Dodds is too busy closing new sponsorship deals negotiating Big Conference television and radio contracts gladhanding with boosters serving on NCAA committees and promoting his selfdescribed passiona college football championship tournament Dodds believes critics of a postseason tournament for college footballthe only major sport without a legitimate championship tournamentare after years of debate softening If it were to happen it would have to be approved within the next months says Dodds a window before negotiations for the next round of network television contracts kick into gear Dodds thinks a college football championship would generate about million for each of the or so schools playing Division IA football I think that over a sevenyear period a football playoff is worth several billion he says In the grand scheme of the college sports industry million may not seem like much but Dodds knows well that success comes with a price After last season when Brown took the Longhorns to a postseason bowl for the first time since Dodds ripped up the coachs original contract and signed him to a new tenyear deal worth million annually He added an annuity largely funded by private donors that will give Brown million annually at age should he remain another four years By the way Brown does earn more than the university president Dr Larry R Faulkner whose salary is So does basketball coach Rick Barnes who earns But if youre looking for the sort of acrimony between sports and academics that tears so many schools apart you wont find much of it here I have a lot of respect for Dodds his inventiveness and his way of keeping the organization attuned to opportunities says Faulkner Ive certainly paid attention to that The football coach actually gets to coach about as much as Bill Gates gets to play videogames these days His nine assistants structure and manage practices and deal with most routine player matters Brown like any toplevel executive is expected to be the companys outside guy Hes your COO with a whistle Most of his hours are filled with media obligations about two dozen television and radio stations and newspapers cover the Longhorns fundraising for the entire university as well as the athletic department and trying to keep his own management team in place After last season seven of his assistant coaches were offered head coaching jobs elsewhere Brown kept them all adding to the departments payroll Additionally five coaches were granted annuities worth to at age if they hang on with Brown for four more years On occasion Brown also telephones one of the many corporate executives who are big UT boosters guys like Hicks and San Antonio car dealer Red McCombs another alum and the owner of the NFLs Minnesota Vikings Brown looks to Hicks for timemanagement advice and insights on coping with pressure With McCombs he talks talent and tries to absorb some of the owners upbeat attitude Hey youre talking to one of only two owners whore going to the Super Bowl McCombs told Brown after an earlyseason Longhorn loss At the time the Vikings were One of the things thats common in both of them is that theyre high energy says Brown They have the ability to dream they have a lot of imagination and they dont get down very much In some areas though Brown is on his own The difference between their business and ours is that they can hire and fire who they want to the coach said one October afternoon while lounging on one of the plush leather couches in his office In my business we put our paychecks in the mouths of to yearolds we cant fire Its like that uglybaby theorywe cant get rid of them So we have to hug them and teach them better Another thingCEOs dont have to deal with mothers The major difference for us is the kids Browns kids were whooping it up with plus Longhorn faithful on that October afternoon when the pop of the final gun signaled the end of the Nebraska game Final score Texas Nebraska The victory was a turning point for the young Longhorns that propelled them to their finest season in years Going into their last regularseason game against Texas AM the Longhorns have their best record since winning ten games in albeit one that ended in an atmosphere of tragedy A week before the game students were killed and injured on the AM campus while building a huge bonfire structure for a pregame rally As FORTUNE went to press the game was scheduled to be played This year the Longhorns have been ranked as high as sixth in the AP Top their highest perch since Their reward A possible trip to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in January a prestigious bowl game despite its name Each team in the game receives million To put it another way the Nebraska victory paid off for the Longhorns like an Internet IPO So while Dodds appeared calm amid the postgame celebrations he was actually more relieved than anything If you dont win youre not doing your job he said And you dont survive There have been times of real doubt in recent years at UT athletics as the program struggled to find its way back to football prominence in the s But perhaps the most significant crisis occurred in when seven female athletes filed a lawsuit against the university charging that it had failed to comply with Title IX When the suit was filed about of UTs varsity athletes were women and female athletes received about million in scholarships well short of the million awarded to male varsity athletes Some executives inside the department wanted to fight the charges Recalls Jody Conradt UTs womens athletic director and head coach of womens basketball Some folks said Lets have a final war right here on the University of Texas campus and lets just see whos right Thankfully DeLoss and others said Thats not the way We need to sit down and come up with a solution Just three days after negotiations began the university settled essentially agreeing to all demands Today of the departments scholarship dollars are spent for female athletes who represent of UTs athletes Dodds believes that if the esteemed founders of college sports had not spurned female athletes from the start then the industry would not have endured the turmoil that ruling ignited Somebody somewhere made a big mistake he says Somebody somewhere decided women didnt need to be in sports and I dont know why we werent smart enough to fix it sooner The person most credited with nudgingsome say shovingTexas in the right direction on gender equity is Donna Lopiano a longtime activist for equity for women in sports and now head of the Womens Sports Foundation She became womens athletic director at the University of Texas in the first woman in the country to hold an AD title at a major university Like many advocates for gender equity she felt the university was dragging toward Title IX compliance but as a university official she could not openly encourage students to challenge the university Instead she handed out Title IX manuals and complaint forms from boxes she stashed behind her desk like candy at Halloween Must have done it hundreds of times for years she says laughing at the memory I had boxes of manuals and more boxes to replace them I couldnt believe it when somebody finally did it By it she means filed suit It took someone to be abrasive pushy and all the other adjectives her friends use for Donna says Conradt Donna scares people It wouldnt have happened any other way No question shes the most significant individual for what weve been able to achieve in womens athletics Today womens athletics at UT has its own corporate structure and hierarchy It shares resources with the men in many areas but it has its own management team led by Conradt who like Dodds reports to university vice president Pat Ohlendorf Only a handful of Division I programs are similarly structured I think young women need to see women as bosses Conradt says If the mens and womens departments merged how would women get the chance to run any of the areas This way we have role models for student athletes The women still have a long way to go before reaching parity in one critical areafundraising Last year gifts received by womens sports totaled only But the women are not without their boosters Red McCombs being the biggest Two events led McCombs to an epiphany regarding womens sports One came during what he described as a good ol Bubba meeting about fundraising a few years back When he asked the lone woman in the room to name the most generous donors for womens athletics he recalls She looked at me like I was crazy and said Mr McCombs there are none Soon afterward McCombs young granddaughter told him that she could not find a girls softball team to join He realized that wasnt going to change as long as the woman in the good ol Bubba meeting was right So four years ago he wrote a check for million to the UT womens athletic program the largest single gift to womens collegiate sports anyone can recall Earlier this year the Red and Charline McCombs Softball Stadium opened on UTs campus Title IX clearly stoked the growth in college sports programs a quartercentury ago but where will the money come from to sustain future growth Theres at least some concern that college sports is already locked squarely in corporate Americas cross hairs as the next sportsmarketing frontier For years only the likes of Nike Reebok and other sports brands had major deals with college teams Now hightech companies like eBay and Nextel are lining up alongside softdrink financialservices and entertainment companies to sell their products and services to your kids Companies once worried about being called crass for slapping logos on college campuses Today there is no shame Take the annual TexasOklahoma game the meeting of two of the most celebrated rivals in college football history For two years now it has been called the Dr Pepper Red River Shootout also sponsored by Southwestern Bell MercedesBenz Bank of America Miller Brewing and the Texas Land Cattle Co a local restaurant chain Its worth in excess of to each school Be very afraid For now corporate deals remain only a minor revenue source for most big colleges But as TV money and ticket prices peak and donors get short arms and cant reach their wallets after a couple of dog seasons youll see what I mean it could become the most vital source of future growth Texas new deal with Nike for instance provides UT athletics with up to million in Nike gear along with in cash annually for the next nine years Thats equal to the largest sponsorship deal in college sports and more than twice the value of the departments previous contract with Reebok While Dodds is mindful of the need to maintain some boundaries against unbridled commercialism hes more concerned that some major college programs may be forced out of bigtime football altogether because they cant keep up with escalating costs Sometimes the scale of all this makes Dodds wistful What Id like to do is maybe start over with this whole thing he says because its gotten to the point where you dont control it you manage it and its a challenge Nevertheless Texas is banking on being a leader in ecommerce for college sports Sales through its nascent Website are almost nil But with nearly a halfmillion Texas Exes out hereand Longhorn football on a rollthe upside is vast Hook em iHorns On that Saturday afternoon in the fall when the Longhorns grew up against Nebraska an elderly fan in dark glasses sat quietly on the front row of a luxury box at the stadium named in his honor Darrell Royal is still greeted as Coach Royal around Austin Hes in awe of his surroundings amazed that the program he helped build has become a multimilliondollar operation He never had to raise funds as a coach never had to do anything but coachand well fix the place up a bit When I first got here in there was a brokendown old shack in the end zone he says Caretaker lived there It took a few years but we finally got it torn down He laughed at another recollection He couldnt understand why fans refused to sit in an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and realized that there were no bathrooms up there Coach Royal doesnt much bother Dodds with advice anymore though he did mention one thing a while back I told him Nothing makes Texans as happy as winning and its happy folks that give Like any good executive Dodds listened well BOX STORY University of Texas Athletics Dept Revenue million FOOTBALL revenue million

Lay and Jeff NRON PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state,nemec-g,

Subject Coen Bros Coens hit most notes in Brother O Brother Where Art Thou Southern comedydrama color PG By Todd McCarthy Daily Variety Chief Film Critic CANNES Variety A musically tinged riff on The Odyssey set in the Depressionera Deep South O Brother Where Art Thou is a charming if lightweight Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial cumulative impact which will likely translate into just OK box office results come domestic release in the fall While the films epigraph and inspiration come from Homer its title derives from Preston Sturges filmbiz classic Sullivans Travels in which the successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called O Brother Where Art Thou Despite appropriating the handle the Coens arent about to fall into the trap of pretentiousness themselves crafting instead a seriocomedy that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals with the leader Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney telling his cronies Pete John Turturro and Delmar Tim Blake Nelson that he knows where million is buried The first person they encounter however a blind black man driving a railway handcar warns them that they will find treasure out there but not the treasure theyre seeking A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology Its a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart he advises Everett stands by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism Picking up a young black musician Tommy Johnson Chris Thomas King on the road the fellows wander into an isolated radio stationrecording studio and posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys cut a lively tune and are paid a few bills for their efforts They then take off again and remain oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the lushly verdant landscapes which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in slightly washedout and burnished hues that are a constant delight They hook up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson a wonderfully livewired Michael Badalucco who hates his nickname Babyface and goes into a huge postcrime funk In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of visuals performance and music the boys come upon three sirens who seduce them in a watery glade when Pete disappears thereafter the dense Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad which he proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory oneeyed salesman for the word of God a Cyclopslike John Goodman squeezes the critter to death while beating the other two silly Pete eventually turns up again only to become perturbed when Everett reveals that his real goal rather than the nonexistent treasure is to reunite with the mother of his seven daughters Penny Holly Hunter who is about to marry another fellow In the course of things the errant adventurers brush up against local politics a governors race that pits old incumbent Pappy ODaniel Charles Durning against a reform candidate whose motto Friend of the Little Man is literally represented by a broomtoting dwarf who accompanies him at every campaign stop After slipping in a quiet homage to Sullivans Travels in which members of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a picture show the Coens deliver one of their major set pieces a stupendously choreographed Ku Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes the invasion of the Wicked Witchs castle by Dorothys friends in The Wizard of Oz Raucous thedevilgetshisdue musical climax is fun and given a big charge by Durning in a splendid performancecapping turn but is also rather too fairytaleish and toogoodtobetrue to truly satisfy leaving this an Odyssey without full closure Lack of irony and complexity in the wrapup may be a shortcoming but it also points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the films portrait of dimwits con men rednecks and country folk Most of the characters including the three leads may be dumb misguided and delusional but they are also engaging and straightforward to be enjoyed for the colorful oddballs that they are Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everetts vanity and in delivering the Coens carefully calibrated hightoned dialogue Turturro and Nelson a character actor who directed the indie Eye of God and the upcoming Othello update O are a real dumbanddumber combo without veering into slapstick while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness from Durning and wellknown regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root as the blind recording entrepreneur musician King as the boys sometime collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the escapees to the bitter end Not as elaborate as The Hudsucker Proxy or The Big Lebowski pic is nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins splendid camerawork blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassners evocative production design Mary Zophres imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are all but imperceptible as such watch for that cow Delta blues music a combo of T Bone Burnett and preexisting tunes is another major plus Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney Pete John Turturro Delmar Tim Blake Nelson Pappy ODaniel Charles Durning Big Dan Teague John Goodman George Nelson Michael Badalucco Penny Holly Hunter Radio Station Man Stephen Root Tommy Johnson Chris Thomas King Homer Stokes Wayne Duvall Sheriff Cooley Daniel Von Bargen Pappys Staff JR Horne Brian

Subject FW Trip Details FYI Eric Gillaspie Counsel Shell Trading Gas and Power Company Tel Fax HC Original Message From jonathan gillaspie mailto Sent Saturday May AM To Gillaspie Eric Subject Re Trip Details Dan Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet It would be impossible Anyway heres a quick update from the battlefield In regards to flight plans we had a minor setback today We called our local Wuxi travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix I asked her if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports After much heated debate she said no However we then called Shanghai Pudong Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry They demanded that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports Therefore Ill need for you to provide me with the full names first middle last for everybody in your group Well then pass these on to the Wuxi agent who has already lined up the ShanghaiQingdao flight Well also provide the full names to agents wholl be setting up the other flights Secondly let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao Zang Bao Guo to line us up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote Jeff felt that the person fee was too much he stated that he had retirement savings to consider ha Weve spent the last couple days in negotiations with another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the same Beijing tour package at a more budgetminded price Today she gave us a rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package The estimated price would be about couple for the same five day package in Beijing This is in comparison to your price quite of person for a five day package We would downgrade from a star hotel to a star hotel its new Keep in mind that were still hammering out the details but the alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the wallet The crude itinerary would look something like this June fly to Beijing in the morning check into hotel tour the Forbidden City see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening June Great Wall Ding Temple tombs Beijing roast duck dinner June Temple of Heaven Summer Palace dinner at the Old Beijing Tea House

He Gong Tibetan temple free evening June Hutong alley tour lunch at a Xinjiang Chinese Muslim cuisine restaurant Wangfujing Street shopping at the trendy stores Beijing opera in the evening June most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai We knocked out some destinations from the original plan For example the dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang antique shopping Ai Ping called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldnt be very interesting it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we see on TV every night The dance performance didnt include any minority group dances or traditional village styles so Ai Ping didnt think it sounded very Chinese If the antique shopping is desired its an onthestreet auction with other stores selling original and notsooriginal fake items we can slap it back on the itinerary I dont give a hoot either way I aim to please and we are extremely flexible Ai Pings hometown is six hours west of Beijing Shes been to Beijing a billion times she doesnt care where we go Let me know what you think and well do as instructed Thirdly I dont think well be needing any deposit money The airplane tix will be reserved in your names The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to have your ShanghaiQingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that you could pay there The QingdaoBeijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon arrival The Beijing agent hasnt mentioned a deposit for the tour package yet If she does Ill put the money down no problem So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do the Shanghai tour package your call It looks like a good plan to me If you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it Let me know Hope this gives you an idea on where were at Please respond asap with commentsquestions Hope all is swell in Tejas Will write again soon My Regards Jon Gillaspie From Daniel Junk To Jonathan Gillaspie CC Eric Gillaspie Subject Trip Details Date Fri May PDT Jon how is crisis management these days I hope it is coming together for you I hate to bother you but was wondering if Ai Ping has finalized anything with the travel agency or airlines Im sure there are going to be deposits required and such when the reservations are made Just let me know what youre needing from us In the mean time keep cool The suffering will end

PANEL Before Commissioners James J Hoecker Chairman Vicky A Bailey William L Massey Linda Breathitt and Curt Hebert Jr OPINION On March Clear Creek Storage Company LLC Clear Creek file d an application pursuant to section of the Natural Gas Act NGA for a certificate to convert a natural gas production reservoir to a natural gas storage facility to construct appurtenant facilities and to operate the storage field and related facilities for the sole use of Clear Creeks two owners Questar Energy Trading Company Questar Energy and Montana Power Ventures Inc Montana Power Clear Creek requests that to the extent feasible the authorization granted to it be a limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek also requests waivers of various Commission regulations and requirements For the reasons discussed below we will grant Clear Creeks request for authorization to convert the production reservoir to a gas storage facility and to construct and operate facilities However we will require Clear Creek t o operate the facility on an open access basis I Background Questar Energy and Montana Power formed Clear Creek to own and operate t he proposed Clear Creek storage project Questar Energy owns percent and Montana Power owns percent of Clear Creek Questar Energy is a whollyow ned subsidiary of Questar Corporation and a natural gas marketing affiliate of Questar Pipeline Company an interstate pipeline Questar Energy engages in marketing of natural gas crude oil and electricity It purchases natural gas from affiliated production companies and unaffiliated companies Montana Power is an affiliate of Montana Power Company an electric and gas utility regulated by the Commission as well as the State of Montana Montan a Power engages in natural gas business development which will include purchasing and selling natural gas upon approval of Clear Creeks application Clear Creek states that both Questar Energy and Montana Power plan to activ ely purchase and sell natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region and elsewhere i n the United States Therefore they both wish to develop storage capabilities to better manage their natural gas supplies including the balancing of their F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS respective natural gas supplies and supply acquisition opportunities with current and projected demand for natural gas Clear Creek states that the storage capacity will assist Questar Energy and Montana Power to buy and sell gas when it is most economically favorable to do so to offer more reliable supply products to potential customers and to manage transportation obligations to minimize exposure to penalties and cashout charges Clear Creek proposes to locate its storage project in the depleted Nugge t reservoir in the Clear Creek Field in Uinta County Wyoming an active natu ral gas production region Chevron Inc discovered the field in The fiel d produced gas from until when it was shutin after production of o il and gas from the field was no longer economic Prior to shutin wells produced natural gas that was delivered through existing pipeline facilitie s into Northwest Pipeline Corporation Kern River Gas Transmission Company a nd Questar Pipeline Company Clear Creek states that the interconnecting pipeline taps laterals gathering facilities and wells are still in place and with minor modifications will be used to transport gas in and out of the proposed storage facility Questar Energy has owned and operated the Clear Creek field since late having acquired it from its affiliate Universal Resources Corporation Universal a natural gas producer Universal tested the field in and and determined that the depleted oilgas reservoir in the Nugget formation can economically be converted to a storage project of up to Bcf of working ga s n Questar Energy plans to transfer its interests in the field to Clear Creek Footnotes n Universal requested and received an exemption pursuant to section cB of the NGA to test the Clear Creek field for a possible storage project to be undertaken by it or one of its affiliates See Universal Resources Corp FERC P Docket No CP End Footnotes II Proposal Clear Creek proposes to convert a reservoir in the Nugget formation in a depleted natural gas production field in the Clear Creek Participation Area PA of the Painter Reservoir Unit to a gas storage facility The Clear Creek PA is located in Uinta County Wyoming approximately miles northeast of Evanston The proposed project would reuse facilities in place within the Clear Creek PA from previous activities in Sections and of the production field Lands in Section are administered by the Bureau of Land Management BLM and lands in Section are owned privately by Uinta Livestock Grazing Partnersh ip The Nugget formation is located at an approximate depth of feet and storage will be water driven Clear Creek expects to operate the storage reservoir at a pressure of approximately psi Clear Creek proposes to develop Bcf of working storage capacity supported by to Bcf of cushi on gas Questar Energy and Montana Power will supply cushion gas in proportion to their membership interests The project is expected to have a maximum gas F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS injection capability of up to MMcfday at approximately psi and a maximum withdrawal capability of up to MMcfday at approximately ps i Clear Creek states that it will own and be responsible for operating the storage project Under the Construction Operation and Management Agreement between Clear Creek Questar Energy and Montana Power Clear Creek will contract with Questar Energy to operate the field on a day to day basis A Facilities Clear Creek states that conversion of the field to storage will require minimal construction and will enable it to maximize the use of existi ng facilities that were installed in connection with previous exploration and production activity at the field Clear Creek proposes to use a single existing well for injectio ns and withdrawals and up to existing wells for monitoring Clear Creek expe cts to use the existing roads pipeline facilities buildings fencing rightsofway pads and cleared areas and some of the existing storage tanks Clear Creek proposes to install the following new facilities two hp compressors possibly leased which will be installed in an existing building designed and historically used for compressors one JouleThompson Liquid Extraction Plant skid mounted which will be located in an already cleared fenced site new insulation wrapping and electric heat tracing for the existing injectionwithdrawal line that connects the injectionwithdrawal well to th e compressor building one gallon natural gas liquids storage tank located in an existi ng cleared fenced site a skidmounted production unit to separate water and free hydrocarbon liquids from the production stream during withdrawal operations two additional barrel water tanks to be located in predistur bed sites new inch tubing in the injectionwithdrawal well inside the existing inch casing and communications and monitoring equipment Clear Creek anticipates that it also will be necessary to modify existin g pipeline facilities that connect the field to Questar Pipeline Clear Creek expects Questar Pipeline to replace under its blanket construction certificate approximately feet of inch pipe and meter run with an equivalent lengt h of inch pipe and meter run Clear Creek requests authority to modify its lin e connected to the Clear Creek Field to accommodate those modifications by Questar Pipeline Clear Creek states that historically gas was delivered from the field into Questar Pipeline and was received from and delivered back to Questar Pipel ine during Universals well tests Clear Creek submits that in the future it F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS expects to receive gas from and deliver gas to other pipelines in the area including Northwest Pipeline Corporation and Kern River However Clear Cre ek does not seek approval at this time to construct any facilities necessary t o implement these additional receipt and delivery points B Services Clear Creek proposes to render storage services solely for its two membe rs Questar Energy and Montana Power which will receive storage capacity right s in direct proportion to their ownership interests ie Questar Energy will h ave use of percent of the fields storage capacity and Montana Power will ha ve use of percent of the capacity Questar Energy and Montana Power will al so have firm use of injection and withdrawal capabilities totaling MMcfd a nd MMcfd respectively on a percentage basis equal to the share of storage capacity rights Each will have a right to unused injection and withdrawal capabilities on an interruptible basis Clear Creek proposes to provide no storage service to any entity other than its owners Questar Energy and Montana Power will each own and store its own ga s in the capacity it holds C Requested Waivers Clear Creek states that it neither requests nor desires a blanket certificate to transport for others Therefore Clear Creek requests the Commission to waive any requirement that the proposed project be operated on an open access bas is Clear Creek submits that its proposal is different from the situations presented in two cases Total Peaking Services LLC Total Peakin g n and Hopkinton LNG Corporation Hopkinton n in which the Commission rejec ted private storage proposals involving existing liquid natural gas LNG facilities belonging to local distribution companies LDCs and required the applicant s to provide open access storage Unlike those cases Clear Creek maintains its proposed project is not located in a market area but in a supply area surrounded by both major production areas and major interstate pipelines In addition the reservoir Clear Creek proposes to convert to storage was not previously developed by a regulated LDC or any other form of regulated entity and thus there are no risks of crosssubsidies by ratepayers Further submits Clear Creek there are no concerns about an affiliated LDC engaging in capacity brokering to deliver gas to or from market area LNG plants a unique market advantage described by the Commission in Total Peaking Footnotes n FERC P n FERC P End Footnotes Further Clear Creek argues its proposal is for a small low budget project which cannot readily be increased in size to accommodate new demands for storage from a thirdparty without a great increase in associated costs and to a lesser extent environmental consequences Clear Creek also maintains that dilutio n of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the quantity of storage available to Questar Energy and Montana Power would undermine their incentives to proceed Clear Creek states that the project s costs would increase due to the sizable regulatory burdens associated with preparing and maintaining tariffs ratemaking utilitybased accounting practices reporting GISB EBBs additional personnel and marketingaffiliate rules requiring separation of Clear Creek from its two marketer owners Further it contends an open access requirement would expose it to economic risks a nd thirdparty liability issues such as risks of gas loss force majeure proj ect failure and credit that do not exist for a project that would only serve i ts two owners Accordingly Clear Creek requests waivers of all reporting requirements including the obligation to file Form or similar reports any obligation to file rates tariffs contracts or contract amendments any obligat ion to justify rates on any basis other than those the parties negotiated as pa rt of the Agreement any obligation to follow the Uniform System of Accounts any obligation to adhere to GISB standards or to maintain an EBB any obligatio n to separate personnel or otherwise to adhere to marketing affiliate rules as t hey might otherwise apply to the relationship between Clear Creek and its owner s n and any other rules or requirements that would otherwise apply to an open access pipeline or storage company Footnotes n Clear Creek acknowledges that Questar Energy would remain subject to the marketing affiliate rules as they apply to its dealings with Questar Pipeli ne Co End Footnotes III Interventions Notice of Clear Creeks application was published in the Federal Registe r on March Fed Reg Colorado Interstate Gas Company Natur al Gas Clearinghouse Northwest Pipeline Corporation and Questar Pipeline Company filed timely motions to intervene n No protests were filed Footnotes n Timely unopposed motions to intervene are granted by the operation o f c of the Commissions regulations End Footnotes IV Discussion A Jurisdiction Since the proposed facilities will be used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce subject to the Commissions jurisdiction the requested authorization is subject to section c of the NGA B Public Convenience and Necessity Order No n was designed to encourage interstate pipelines to provi de F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS unbundled openaccess transportation Clear Creek proposes that the Commission make an exception for its storage proposal and not require it to provide o pen access storage services As we stated in Hopkinton and Total Peaking we fi nd that such proposals are not in the public interest Footnotes n Pipeline Service Obligations and Revisions to

on remand Order No C FERC P cert denied S Ct End Footnotes Clear Creek seeks to distinguish its proposal from those in Hopkinton an d Total Peaking by noting that unlike those two proposals its proposed stor age facility is not in the market area and does not raise crosssubsidization o r capacity brokering issues We recognize that those issues are not present i n Clear Creeks proposal Nevertheless its proposal is the same in one overriding aspect Clear Creek seeks authorization to perform jurisdictional interstat e transportation with no requirement that such service be offered on an openaccess basis Such proposals are inconsistent with the regulatory goal s embodied in Order No which was intended to encourage interstate pipelines to provide openaccess services including storage Therefore we will requ ire Clear Creek to restructure its proposal into one that is consistent with th e principles of Order No Specifically we will issue Clear Creek a Part blanket transportation certificate conditioned on Clear Creeks filing wit hin days of the date of issuance of this order a revised Exhibit P to its application setting forth its proposed tariff and initial rates along with supporting schedules for openaccess firm and interruptible storage service and storagerelated transportation that comply with the requirement s of Part and with the Commissions restructuring rules as expressed in Orde r No To the extent Clear Creek seeks to charge marketbased rates it must ma ke a showing that it lacks market power The Commission has issued several order s that provide guidance on the criteria it uses to evaluate marketbased rate proposals n In addition an applicants marketbased study should be consistent with the Commissions policy statement on ratemaking n and must show among other things that a the relevant market provides good alternatives to the applicant and is not defined too broadly b the alternatives are timely c the applicant is not able to exercise market power over the price of the product and d the quality of service is equivalent Clear Creek should provide this information in the tariff filing required above Footnotes F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS n New York State Electric Gas Corporation NYSEG FERC P Moss Bluff Hub Partners LP FERC P Egan Hub Partners LP FERC P and K N Interstate Gas Transmission Company FER C P n Alternatives to Traditional CostofService Ratemaking for Natural Ga s Pipelines FERC P End Footnotes Clear Creek requests a limited jurisdiction certificate The Commission issues such certificates to allow nonjurisdictional parties to engage in certain jurisdictional activities without affecting the status of their otherwise nonjurisdictional activities Since Clear Creeks sole function is to provi de interstate storage services there is no need to issue Clear Creek a limite d jurisdiction certificate However we clarify that the authorization grante d to Clear Creek will not affect the nonjurisdictional status of Questar Energy or Montana Power Because we are approving a Part blanket certificate rather than the limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek requested Clear Creek must comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to other natural gas companies providing Part service Accordingly we deny Clear Creeks request for waiver of those requirements We will not require Clear Creek to hold an open season since it has agreements with Questar Energy and Montana Power for all of the capacity of its proposed storage facility and no party has protested the arrangement Clear Creeks concern that an open access requirement for its storage facility would require it to enlarge its project is unfounded There is no requireme nt to offer more capacity than exists or to increase a facilitys capacity to accommodate potential customers An openaccess transporter need only offer on an openaccess basis existing capacity for which it has no contracts In th is regard we note that the agreement between Clear Creek and its two owners i s for all of the existing capacity for a term of twenty years Finally we note that Clear Creek may apply for a Part blanket certificate under which it could undertake future modifications to the stor age facilities and operations C Engineering The Commission has evaluated Clear Creekss proposal and concludes that the development of the Clear Creek reservoir as an underground gas storage fiel d is feasible We also evaluated the proposed storage design facilities capaci ty and injectionwithdrawal estimates and do not foresee any technical problem s regarding the development of this field Accordingly in view of these circumstances we will require that The maximum inventory of natural gas stored in Clear Creek shall not exceed Bcf at psia and degrees F and the maximum shutin bott om hole reservoir pressure shall not exceed psig without prior Commissio n authorization and F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Clear Creek shall submit semiannual reports in accordance with section c of the regulations These reports shall continue to be filed unt il one year after the storage inventory volume has reached or closely approximates Bcf D Environmental Assessment The Commission prepared an environmental assessment EA for Clear Creek s proposal The EA addresses construction procedures geology soils water resources wetlands vegetation wildlife hydrostatic testing federally listed threatened and endangered species cultural resources land use air and no ise quality and alternatives Based on the discussion in the EA we conclude that if constructed in accordance with Clear Creeks application and supplements filed on April and May approval of this proposal would not constitute a major Federa l action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment As recommended in the EA this authorization includes the following conditions Clear Creek shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation measures described in its application and supplements including responses to staff data requests and as identified in the EA Clear Creek must a request any modifications to these procedures measures or condition s in a filing with the Secretary of the Commission b justify each modification relative to site specific conditions c explain how that modification provides an equal or greater level of environmental protection than the original measure and d receive approval in writing from the Director of Office of Pipeline Regulation OPR before using that modification The Director of OPR has delegated authority to take whatever steps ar e necessary to ensure protection of all environmental resources during construction and operation of the project This authority shall allow a the

Before Commissioners Elizabeth Anne Moler Chair Vicky A Bailey Jame s J Hoecker William L Massey and Donald F Santa Jr OPINION On December TexasOhio Pipeline Inc TexasOhio filed an application pursuant to section c of the Natural Gas Act NGA and Parts and of the Commissions regulations for certificates of public convenie nce and necessity to operate its facilities in interstate commerce and to perfo rm openaccess transportation services on existing facilities known as the Hun ter Pipeline in Garrard County Kentucky TexasOhio also requested a temporary certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline on an interim basis pending issuance of a permanent certificate On January the Commission issued TexasOhio a temporary certificate authorizing service to existing customers utilizing the Hunter Pipeline th e temporary certificate is to expire upon issuance of a final Commission orde r on the request for a permanent blanket certificate n On February Industrial Energy Services Company IESCO sought rehearing of the January order n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC We will grant TexasOhio a casespecific certificate pursuant to P art subpart A of the Commissions regulations to operate the Hunter Pipeli ne in interstate commerce and a blanket transportation certificate pursuant to Pa rt subpart G of the Commissions regulations These authorizations are ma de subject to compliance with the conditions set forth in this order For the reasons set forth below IESCOs request for rehearing is denied Notices and Interventions Notice of TexasOhios application was published in the Federal Register on December Fed Reg Algonquin Gas Transmission Company CNG Transmission Corporation Elizabethtown Gas Company Endevco Oil and Gas Company Endevco Enron Gas Marketing Inc Equitrans Inc IESCO OR Energy I nc OR Energy Public Service Electric and Gas Company and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation TETCO filed timely unopposed motions to interve ne F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS n Endevco OR Energy and TETCO support TexasOhios application IESCO protests the application and requests an evidentiary hearing n Timely unopposed motions to intervene are granted pursuant to Rule of the Commissions Rules of Practice and Procedure CFR On December TexasOhio filed an answer to that portion of IESC Os protest opposing the issuance of a temporary certificate IESCO responded t o TexasOhios answer on January n n Pursuant to section of the Commissions regulations CFR an answer to a protest is not permitted unless the Commission orders otherwise In order to have as complete a factual record as possible in thi s proceeding we will accept the December and January filin gs of TexasOhio and IESCO respectively On February Energy Marketing Exchange Inc filed a petition fo r leave to intervene out of time For good cause shown and since the late intervention will not prejudice any party to this proceeding or otherwise delay the proceeding we will grant Energy Marketings motion to intervene out of time Background The Hunter Pipeline is an interconnection between facilities of Tennesse e Gas Pipeline Company Tennessee and TETCO It consists of two horsepower compressors and approximately feet of aboveground inch diameter gas pipeline The Hunter Pipeline is capable of transporting Mcf per day of natural gas TexasOhio constructed the Hunter Pipeline pursuant to a certificate iss ued by the Kentucky Public Service Commission Kentucky PSC on November This authorization designated TexasOhio as an intrastate pipeline operatin g as a transporting utility However because TexasOhio did not hold an openseason prior to commencing transportation operations only TexasOhio Gas Inc an d its sales customers acquired capacity on the Hunter Pipeline n After constructing the facilities TexasOhio filed an application with the Commission in Dock et No PR seeking approval of rates under section a of the Natural Gas Policy Act NGPA The Commission instituted rate proceedings on April to determine whether TexasOhios rates were fair and equitable n n TexasOhio is a whollyowned subsidiary of TexasOhio Gas Inc TOG a Houstonbased marketer that ships Gulf Coast gas to northeastern industrial endusers via Tennessee and TETCO Prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline TOG faced separate bottlenecks on the Tennessee and TETCO systems during th e winter heating season the location and capacity of the Hunter Pipeline was selected to avoid these bottlenecks n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC On June TexasOhio suspended transportation service through the Hunter Pipeline upon discovering that the gas being moved through those facilities was not produced in Kentucky and therefore that it was engaged in F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the interstate transportation of natural gas without authorization under NG A section or NGPA section Subsequently the Commission instituted an investigation into the construction and operation of the Hunter Pipeline T hat investigation determined that from the first day of operation on December through its voluntary shutdown on June the Hunter Pipeline transported gas in interstate commerce n On October the Commiss ion approved a stipulation and consent agreement in which TexasOhio agreed to pay a civil penalty and to implement a program to comply with the NGA a nd NGPA n n TexasOhio received all the gas that flowed through the Hunter Pipeli ne from Tennessees interstate facility TexasOhio then redelivered the gas t o TETCOs interstate facility n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Proposal TexasOhio requests authorization to operate its facilities in interstat e commerce and perform openaccess transportation service TexasOhio proposes to charge firm shippers a transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of per MMBtu and a commodity charge of per MMBtu Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of per MMBtu nn The proposed initial rates are the same as those which TexasOhio was authorized to charge during the effectiveness of the temporary certificate TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at TexasOhio states that operation of the Hunter Pipeline will permit shippers to avoid bottlenecks on the systems of Tennessee and TETCO TETCOs bottlen eck is located at a point near the KentuckyTennessee border Due to this constraint TETCO has historically curtailed the interruptible transportati on of natural gas from receipt points located south of the Kentucky Tennessee border that is destined for delivery to points north during the winter heating season During the past three winter seasons TETCO has curtailed interruptible transportation for gas originating upstream of its Mt Pleasant compressor station in Tennessee that is scheduled for delivery downstream to Zon es C and D The bottleneck on Tennessees system occurs in Mercer County Pennsylvan ia As a result gas produced and transported from receipt points south of Merc er County cannot be transported to points north of Mercer County during certai n periods of the year During the past four winter seasons Tennessee has curtailed gas moving on an interruptible basis from points upstream of stations and to locations downstream of those stations TexasOhios facilities are positioned to avoid both bottlenecks In thi s regard Tennessee typically has interruptible transportation capacity for deliveries to Texas Ohios facilities but has bottlenecks downstream of i ts interconnection with TexasOhio Conversely TETCO has a bottleneck upstrea m of TexasOhios facilities but has capacity for the movement of interruptible transportation volumes downstream of its Mt Pleasant compressor station A s such TexasOhios facilities can be utilized to alleviate bottlenecks on t wo different pipeline systems and thereby move gas to markets in the Northeast F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Discussion The Commission finds that by utilizing the Hunter Pipeline shipper s located upstream of the TETCO bottleneck can utilize Tennessees system to move gas to TexasOhio for redelivery to TETCO and continued transportation downstream Shippers upstream of Tennessees bottleneck but downstream of TexasOhios facilities can by displacement utilize TexasOhios system to access the TETCO system for continued transportation downstream This arrangement will avoid both the upstream and downstream bottlenecks and all ow continued delivery of gas to various northeast markets located off both the TETCO and Tennessee systems We find that the public convenience and necess ity requires issuance of a certificate pursuant to Part subpart A authorizing operation of TexasOhios Hunter Pipeline The Commission also finds that TexasOhios pro forma tariff generally complies with the requirements for a Part blanket transportation certificate Accordingly we will grant Texas Ohios application for a Par t blanket transportation certificate subject to the conditions set forth her ein to ensure TexasOhios full compliance with the conditions of Order Nos and TexasOhios Part blanket certificate will become effecti ve upon TexasOhios full compliance with these conditions I Rates TexasOhio proposes to charge the initial rates that were approved in th e temporary certificate Under this proposal firm shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of per MMBt u and a commodity charge of per MMBtu Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of per MMBtu The proposed rates are based on the modified fixed variable rate design MFV percent equity capitalization a percent return on equity and a perc ent depreciation The reservation and usage charges are based on percent of the system design capacity A Rate Design Order No requires pipelines to use the straight fixed variable SFV rate design methodology n TexasOhio has not provided any evidence which would support an exception to this requirement Accordingly we find that TexasO hio should be required to use the SFV rate design methodology Additionally si nce TexasOhios cost of service does not include any variable costs we will require it to use as the minimum FTS usage and ITS rates n n See CFR d n See Gateway Pipeline Co FERC B Capitalization and Rate of Return TexasOhio proposes a capitalization consisting of percent equity W e find that it is appropriate to use a hypothetical capital structure consist ing of percent debt and percent equity this structure is based on the percent average equity ratio held by a group of seven major investor owned interstate pipelines at the end of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS We have generally used recent rates for Baarated public utility bonds t o set the debt costs on similar projects since Baa is the prevailing rating for pipeline bonds The rate for Baa utility bonds averaged percent for th e six months ending July with a one month average of percent for J uly We find it appropriate to utilize a cost of debt of percent TexasOhios proposed percent rate of return on equity is excessive considering the prevailing cost of capital We find acceptable a rate of return derived from a range of returns based upon an analysis of recent interest rates and a discounted cash flow DCF study The lower end of the range is determined by the prevailing Baa rating for public utility bonds as discussed above we will use a figure of percent for the most recent six months Si nce equity is riskier than debt basis points should be added to the bond rate thus bringing the lower end of the range to percent The upper end of the range is determined by a DCF analysis of a proxy gr oup of seven publicly held natural gas transmission companies n This proxy group is used because the DCF methodology requires market price data as an input in the estimation of investorexpected equity returns The DCF analysis for th e proxy group results in a range of equity returns of percent to percent with a median return of percent n Coastal Corporation El Paso Natural Gas Company Enron Corporation Panhandle Eastern Sonat Inc Transco Energy and Williams Companies Inc This analysis uses dividend yields and forecasts of long term growth ra tes as follows For the first five years the Institutional Brokerage Estimate System IBES estimates of five year growth in earnings per share was used For longerterm growth for the years estimates taken from DRIMcGr aw Hill Energy Review SpringSummer for growth in the natural gas industry were used A growth rate for each company in the proxy group was determined by averaging the two growth rates Combining the bottom and top figures establishes a range of percent to percent The midpoint of this range is approximately percent The Hunter Pipeline went into initial operation in and faces no construction risk Accordingly we find that the companys risk is no highe r than that of the average pipeline Therefore we will require a rate of ret urn on equity of percent which is equal to the midpoint of the range of reasonableness C Depreciation TexasOhio proposes a book depreciation rate of percent calculated on the straightline method which supports an economic life of years We believ e that the economic life of the Hunter Pipeline will depend upon gas reserves connected to the Tennessee system and the future demand for natural gas downstream of those facilities We are confident that market demand and operation of Tennessee and TETCO to service downstream markets in the Northeast States will continue for the next years We also believe that the Hunter Pipeline will operate on a permanent basis and play an important role in th e delivery of gas especially during high demand periods Based on the se factors we find that an economic life of years should be used to calculate a depreciation rate of four percent for the Hunter Pipeline facilities F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS D Conclusion We will require TexasOhio to modify its rates as follows For interruptible service the minimum rate shall be the maximum rate shall be For firm service the minimum reservation charge shall be the maximum reservation charge shall be The usage charge for firm service sha ll be n The rates approved herein are initial rates under NGA section their approval does not constitute approval of any underlying rate methodology principle or concept to be used in any general rate change filed pursuant to NGA section These initial rates will remain in effect until such time as TexasOhio files an NGA section general rate proceeding At that time an y party or the Commission staff may propose new rates based on different methodologies principles or concepts n All rates are expressed per MMBtu II Pro Forma Tariff TexasOhio has applied for a blanket transportation certificate under secti on of the Commissions regulations It proposes to provide bot h firm and interruptible transportation service To commence service under a blanket certificate TexasOhio must file and place into effect rates term s and conditions that are consistent with Part of the regulations TexasOhio has not made a tariff filing in this proceeding it has however filed pro forma tariff sheets which indicate the form its tariff will take Generally the pro forma tariff conforms to the Commissions requirements As discussed below however certain provisions are either inconsistent with the Commissions policies or are not adequately justified Certain specific changes that we will require to be made to TexasOhios pro forma tariff are set forth in an appendix to this order A Order No Review of TexasOhios pro forma tariff indicates a number of changes th at must be implemented to satisfy the requirements of Order No To implem ent those changes TexasOhio must make a tariff filing within days of the d ate of the issuance of this order Also TexasOhio is reminded that while cert ain provisions of Order No may not apply at this time future changes in i ts operations may require tariff revisions to satisfy the requirements of that Order Equality of ServiceOpen Season Pipelines that offer openaccess transportation service must provide tho se services on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas suppliers whether the gas is purchased from the pipeline or from another seller Section biv of the Commissions regulations CFR biv requires a pipelines tariff to reflect the principle of equality of service for all gas transpor ted under each rate schedule TexasOhio performs only unbundled transportation service it does not provide pipeline sales service TexasOhio does however provide transportation service for its affiliated marketers TOG and TexasOhio West Inc Origina l Sheet No section of TexasOhios pro forma tariff provides that F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS customers with an already executed firm transportation contract for service on the Hunter Pipeline as of the effective date of the tariff shall have a priority over customers executing a service agreement at a later date Service is otherwise offered on a firstcome firstserved basis We find that this provision gives preferential treatment to selected customers It is unduly discriminatory and must be removed from the tariff Further we find that TexasOhio has never held an openseason or otherwise provided for the nondiscriminatory allocation of system capacity prior to initiating servic e Accordingly we hold that TexasOhio must implement an open season within days of the date of issuance of an order in this proceeding to ensure non discriminatory allocation of system capacity Pregranted Abandonment and Right of First Refusal Section d of the Commissions regulations CFR d authorizes pregranted abandonment of interruptible and shortterm firm transportation at the end of the contract A shortterm contract is one wit h a term of less than one year For longterm transportation with a term of mor e than a year section bxiii requires the pipeline to establish right of first refusal procedures for use upon expiration of the longterm contra ct TexasOhios pro forma tariff does not comply with these requirements it i s directed to amend its tariff accordingly Capacity Release and Electronic Bulletin Board Section of the Commissions regulations CFR requires interstate pipelines offering firm transportation to establish a capacity release mechanism that allows firm shippers to release all or part of their firm transportation capacity rights to any person who wants to obtain that capac ity by contracting with the pipeline The release may be temporary permanent or subject to conditions ie on an interruptible basis The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate not ove r the maximum rate and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the release Order No requires pipelines to provide timely and equal access to a ny and all information necessary for buyers and sellers to arrange gas sales a nd capacity release including information regarding the availability of capac ity at receipt and delivery points and whether capacity is available from the pipeline directly or through capacity releasing This information must be posted on an electronic bulletin board EBB TexasOhios proposed tariff lacks these provisions It must amend its p ro forma tariff to provide a capacity release mechanism and establish an EBB Upstream Capacity Section of the Commissions regulations CFR provide s that an interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subparts B or G of Part must offer without undue discrimination to assign to its firm shippers its firm transportation capacity including contract storage on all upstream pipelines TexasOhio does not appear to hold any upstream capacity In the tariff filing it is required t o make to comply with the requirements of Order No TexasOhio should st ate whether it holds any capacity on upstream pipelines If it does TexasOhio must F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS revise its tariff to comply with Order No Transition Costs TexasOhios filing predates Order No and consequently makes no comment regarding incurrence of transition costs Accordingly we will not make a determination at this time with respect to TexasOhios level of transition costs III Docket No MT Pursuant to our order of December TexasOhio filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No MT to comply w ith the requirements of section b CFR b n With the exception of the items discussed below we find that TexasOhios filing complies with those requirements n n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Section of the Commissions regulations requires interstate natural gas pipelines that transport natural gas for others pursuant to subparts B G H or K of Part and that are affiliated in any way with a natural gas marketing or brokerin g entity to file certain information relevant to that relationship n On June Order No modified section b effective August by among other things eliminating the requirement that pipelines receive certain information from shippers in requests for transportation service log and post on the EBB complaints made by shippers and include procedures to communicate pricing and capacity information The tariff sheets filed by TexasOhio do not set forth the information required to be filed in a transportation request TexasOhio contends that since it is operating under a temporary certificate and is prohibited from provid ing transportation service to new customers pending further action on its application that information is not applicable While Order No eliminated certain information previously required t o be provided in the transportation request form it still requires pipelines to maintain a log of data used to allocate capacity TexasOhio must comply wi th this provision and file a transportation request form as specified TexasOhio can address this deficiency by either revising existing tarif f provisions including its FTS and ITS request form or by incorporating the changes into Section Order No Compliance Procedures of its propos ed tariff TexasOhio must make a compliance filing within days of the issuance of this order incorporating all information required by Order Nos and Additionally since the tariff sheets TexasOhio filed in Docket No MT are not pro forma TexasOhio should filed corrected tariff sheets in a for m acceptable to become effective upon issuance of an order in this proceeding IVEnvironmental Matters On August TexasOhio notified the Commission that it intended to commence construction of the Hunter Pipeline and that the facilities would be used for the transportation of natural gas under NGPA section a Th is notice provided the environmental information required by section d of the Commissions regulations F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS To ensure that operation of the Hunter Pipeline compressors complies wit h the noise requirements of section d TexasOhio must perform a postconstruction sound survey of the compressor station This survey must be performed not later than days after the date of issuance of this order n TexasOhios application for a Part subpart A certificate to operate t he Hunter Pipeline and a Part subpart G blanket transportation certificat e relies solely on the use of existing facilities no additional construction authorization is requested or granted Accordingly subject to TexasOhios compliance with section d we conclude that approval of the instant application is not a major Federal action significantly affecting th e quality of the human environment n Section d provides that the noise attributable to any compressor facility shall not exceed a daynight sound level of dBA at any existing noisesensitive areasV IESCOs Protest In its protest and request for an evidentiary hearing IESCO charges tha t TexasOhios jurisdictional status must be determined as a precondition to the issuance of a certificate IESCO states that if TexasOhio was not a interstate pipeline for the period from November through June it could not legally offer NGPA section a service and competing sellers of gas such as IESCO could have b een unfairly deprived of their markets The Commissions January order issuing TexasOhio a temporary certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline laid to rest concerns regarding TexasOhios jurisdictional status Further TexasOhio agreed in the settlement approved in the Commissions October order to comply with the NGA NGPA and the Commissions regulations This order issues TexasOhio a case specific certificate pursuant to subpart A of Part and a blanket transportation certificate pursuant to subpart G of Part No questions remain as to the jurisdictional status of TexasOhio IESCO then complains that TexasOhio should have held an openseason dur ing which prospective shippers would have an opportunity to obtain services on the Hunter Pipeline As discussed above the Commission has investigated TexasOhios operation and determined among other things that TexasOhio notified only its marketing affiliate and the marketing affiliates custome rs of the availability of capacity prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline The Commissions policies require TexasOhio to use a nondiscriminatory method of selecting customers for both firm and interruptible transportation service when operating under Part n As noted above we are holding that TexasOhi o must hold an open season prior to commencing service under its Part blanket certificate This approach will ensure that prior notice of firm capacity i s made available to all interested parties on a contemporaneous basis and in a nondiscriminatory manner n n CFR b and b n See eg Pacific Gas Transmission Co FERC at ANR Storage Co FERC at IESCO next asserts that TexasOhios proposed tariff does not assure tha t nondiscriminatory service will be provided We disagree Acceptance by F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS TexasOhio of the blanket transportation certificate authorized by this ord er and as conditioned herein will subject TexasOhio to the full range of the Commissions requirements including those prohibiting discriminatory practices IESCO states that TexasOhio must be required to comply with the provisi ons of the Affiliated Marketer Rule As we noted in the order issuing a tempora ry certificate Order Nos and A apply to all interstate pipelines wit h affiliated marketers Upon acceptance of the temporary certificate Texas O hio became subject to the conditions of those orders n TexasOhios standard s of conduct implementing Order No filed in Docket No MG have be en accepted by the Commission n When TexasOhio complies with this orders directions TexasOhio will be in full compliance with Order No n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Texas Ohio Pipeli ne Inc FERC IESCO asserts that TexasOhios proposed rates have not been shown to be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity It is particularly concerned with the fact that TexasOhio seeks to depreciate it s facilities over a tenyear period As discussed above we agree that TexasOhios proposed rates and tenyear depreciation period are inappropriate and we have required adjustments to those figures as appropriate IESCO also raises in its protest issues relating to Texas Ohios application for a temporary certificate Those issues were addressed in our January order issuing a temporary certificate Issues raised by IESCO on rehearing of that order are discussed below In view of our disposition of the issues raised by IESCO we find that there are no disputed material issues of fact and therefore no need for an evidentiary trialtype hearing n n See Arkla Gathering Services Co FERC VI Request for Rehearing On February IESCO filed a request for rehearing of the Commissions January order issuing TexasOhio a temporary certificate IESCO contends first that issuance of the temporary certificate to TexasO hio was unlawful on three grounds the Commission acted beyond its statutor y authority because it improperly determined that an emergency existed e ven if an emergency existed the Commission failed to make adequate findings supported by substantial evidence and the Commission failed to resolve jurisdictional and tariff issues in connection with issuance of the tempora ry certificate NGA section cB provides that the Commission may issue a tempora ry certificate in cases of emergency to assure maintenance of adequate servic e or to serve particular customers without notice or hearing pending the determination of an application for a permanent certificate The order issuing a temporary certificate expressly found that an emergency exists within the meaning of section cB of the Natural Gas Act and section of the Commissions regulations and that the public convenience and necessity required the issuance of a temporary certificate authorizing TexasOhios F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS operation of the Hunter Pipeline in order to continue service to existing customers who had been relying on that service n In support thereof the order referenced the fact that Raritan River Steel Company the largest employer in Perth Amboy New Jersey would be forced to purchase gas at a higher price and might have to close its plant with disastrous impacts on t he community and a number of entities including the Philadelphia Housing Authority the Dartmouth Finishing Corporation and various schools indicat ed that they are operating under strained budgets and that the inability to transport gas on TexasOhio would result in severe fiscal restraints n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at Under these circumstances we believe that an emergency situation was sh own to exist within the standard established by NGA section and that this conclusion is appropriately supported by the evidence relied upon in the order n n See generally PennYork Energy Corp FERC Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp FERC With regard to its assertion that the Commission failed to resolve certa in jurisdictional and tariff issues prior to the issuance of the temporary certificate IESCO complains that i the Commission issued a temporary certificate without making a finding that TexasOhio is a natural gas company subject to the Commissions NGA jurisdiction ii the failure to resolve t he jurisdictional issue leaves unresolved the question of whether a certificat e of public convenience and necessity is needed for the construction of the Hunt er Pipeline and iii the Commission has left unresolved the question of whet her an openseason is required to assure nondiscriminatory access to TexasOhi os facility thus precluding shippers who were denied service from any opportunity to obtain service during the period that the temporary certificate is in effect IESCOs arguments misapprehend the function of a temporary certificate By its very nature issuance of a temporary certificate precedes decisions on matters related to issuance of the permanent certificate The issues raised by IESCO are appropriate for decision in connection with the issuance of a permanent certificate and we have addressed them above n n We in fact noted in the January order that the issues raise d by IESCO relating to the jurisdictional status of TexasOhio and the provision of service on a nondiscriminatory basis would be resolved upon consideration o f the application for a permanent certificate We stressed at that time that the grant of a temporary certificate is made to allow the resumption of service by specific customers previously utilizing TexasOhios facilities to prevent hardship TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at IESCO also asserts that the Commission improperly refused to order an evidentiary hearing before issuing the temporary certificate IESCO alleges that efforts in Docket No PR to determine the original and ultimate destination of gas transported by TexasOhio were unsuccessful It also sta tes that the proceedings in Docket No PR and the instant docket have b een plagued by uncertainty over the identity of Texas Ohios customers and the nature of the services rendered We disagree that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the issuan ce of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the temporary certificate NGA section c does not require either notice or hearings in conjunction with the issuance of a temporary certificate Even where the statute requires an evidentiary trialtype hearing it is necessary on ly where material issues of fact are in dispute that cannot be resolved on the basis of the written record n The matters raised by IESCO are speculativ e or immaterial to the decision to issue a temporary certificate to allow the resumption of specific services to specific customers Finally IESCO alleg es that the Commission failed to attach conditions needed to prevent abuse of the temporary certificate IESCO states that the temporary certificate should have been expressly limited to serving customers previously served through the Hunter Pipeline and that it should have included a condition for potential refunds n Arkla Gathering Service Co FERC Our January order specifically provided that the temporary certificate is not a blanket authorization but is limited to only those customers with whom TexasOhio has existing transportation agreements n The order further specified that the grant of a temporary certificate is made t o allow the resumption of service by specific customers previously utilizing the Hunter Pipeline n Thus the temporary certificate expressly limited serv ice to existing customers Finally the NGA does not provide for making initial rates subject to refund n Id at n Id at The Commission Orders A Upon the terms and conditions of this order a certificate of public convenience and necessity is issued to TexasOhio pursuant to subpart A of Part of the Commissions regulations as amended from time to time authoriz ing it to operate

answers dated December and January respectively are granted APPENDIX APPENDIX Pro Forma Tariff Analysis Specific Comments Rate Schedules FTS andor ITS Section Availability In this section TexasOhio reserves the right in its sole judgement exercised on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis to decline service whenever it would be contrary to good operational practices or detrimental to other customers Texas Ohio should revise this section to set out the specific criteria or detrimental actions that would trigger this clause Section iii of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provi de TexasOhio with acceptable evidence of among other things gas supply market and other transportation services The term acceptable is vague a nd subject to unduly discriminatory interpretation TexasOhio must set forth specifically the evidence required to be acceptable Section Applicability and Character of Service Section of Rate Schedule ITS states that transportation will be subjec t to curtailment or interruption as deemed necessary in TexasOhios discretion The provision is vague and could result in unduly discriminatory application of curtailment procedures TexasOhio must modify the provision to detail the specific operational characteristics and criteria used to determine the conditions and need for curtailment Section Priority and Interruption of Transportation Service F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides for firm service on a fir st come first served basis However TexasOhio retains a priority for custom ers with existing FTS agreements This provision is unduly discriminatory and m ust be removed from the tariff Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides that TexasOhio can curtail service due to reasons of force majeure or any other operational considerations to be reasonably determined by Texas Ohio TexasOhio must set forth the specif ic operational considerations it would rely upon in exercising this authority In Section of Rate Schedule FTS and Section of Rate Schedule ITS TexasOhio proposes to suspend service if a shippers account is unpaid for days TexasOhio can suspend service without prior Commission approval if a customer fails to pay a billed amount within days of the due date but o nly where days notice is given and the shipper neither pays the bill nor provides guarantee of payment TexasOhio must modify these provisions to provide fo r a day notice period Section Requests for Transportation Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS states that a shipper must comple te a FTS or ITS Request Form however no request form is included TexasOhio must establish a request form as part of its tariff That form m ust comply with the requirements of Order No as set forth in section b of the Commissions regulations Section Operating Conditions Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provide TexasOhio with estimates of gas to be transported and such other operating data as TexasOhio may require This section should be amended to specify what other operating data may be required of shippers Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS specifies that TexasOhio will not provide service on any day for which all necessary upstream and downstream arrangements cannot be confirmed This clause should be amended to state th at any action will be taken on a nondiscriminatory basis Section Rates Section of

Section Waivers Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides that TexasOhio may waive any right s hereunder or any obligations of a customer on a basis which is not unduly discriminatory This language creates the impression that TexasOhio retai ns the discretion to waive default by the shipper of any provision in the tari ff This would give TexasOhio excessive latitude in operating under its tariff

am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak The food wasnt as bad as I thought although I did get the trots the last two days in country I knew I shouldnt have eaten the mutton Fortunately I missed the flood of the century Ernie I heard about it the first week in China Wasnt much I could do from China so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid Doooh Other than that everything is going fine Doing the old dating thing Boy is that a ton of laughs Women at this age are definitely interesting I spend most of my time avoiding questions like Where is this relationship headed Uh

devil freak The food wasnt as bad as I thought although I did get the trots the last two days in country I knew I shouldnt have eaten the mutton Fortunately I missed the flood of the century Ernie I heard about it the first week in China Wasnt much I could do from China so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid Doooh Other than that everything is going fine Doing the old dating thing Boy is that a ton of laughs Women at this age are definitely interesting I spend most of my time avoiding questions like Where is this relationship headed Uh excuse me but we only met last week Congratulations Paul on

McCaffrey Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color

Alan ENRON Sent Thursday November PM To Nemec Gerald Cc Dolan Sue Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreements with PSCo and CLFP Gerald At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the abovereferenced Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado PSCo and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power CLFP I apologize for the delay Our comments are as follows Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues We request in Section that the dollar level be applicable to each of our companies We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section be as to each of our companies Confirmations In the second line please change may to shall We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section Transactions Netting and Offset We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo or CLFP acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement Early Termination I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two nor more than ten Business Days following the date of such notice Triggering Event In the th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence Please delete this phrase in the Agreement and References to Affiliates In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections and reference is made to Affiliates For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies Moreover neither PSCo nor CLFP is authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLFP in the respective Agreements Article Force Majeure The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section Notices Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section Transfer We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section Limitation of Remedies We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a day confirm deadline rather than hours as reflected in your definition We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured longterm senior debt of such Party or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB or its equivalent by Standard Poors or below Baa or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have any unsecured longterm senior debt that is rate by either Standard Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a or day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated above regarding the PSCo Agreement with the following exceptions Section Triggering Event The dollar levels near the end of the Section should be equivalent between our companies Please make each Section Collateral Requirement Similarly the dollar trigger levels in this provision should be equivalent between our companies Please make each Except for the foregoing please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return email or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration I look forward to working with you to finalize these Agreements Alan

Lay and Jeff NRON PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject California Energy Crisis Californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months Unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues What happened in California The source of Californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand Californias economy grew percent since This incr eased the demand for electricity by percent At the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added The resul t predictably is a shortage This summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state In addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis First the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility I n California state regulation prevented this strategy This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price Second retail markets were not deregulated Regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate They are now nearly bankrupt In short Californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices At the time California was developing its restructuring plan Enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis Enrons Role Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem Power sellers including Enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media Here are the facts Other than a small amount of wind power Enron is not a generator in the state of California Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers Because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices We ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers As a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face We protected and still protect our customers from price volatility You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market Early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities Here are the facts As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities This decision reduced EESs market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates EES did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis Enron continues to sign up customers in the state and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets Enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs There has never been more demand for our products and services The Solution The solution to Californias crisis is also straightforward In summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities Increasing Supply Californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year In California it often takes to years California simpl y must streamline this process Ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much NOx California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities Reducing Demand Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is An open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today California should fully open its retail market Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market In a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis The state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk Restoring the Financial Integrity of the States Institutions The utilities in California are not paying their bills This has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions California must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed Just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse Price caps have been proposed They dont work have never work ed and they will not work here Price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall ey or Silicon Valley Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California There is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state,nemec-g,

We called our local Wuxi travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix I asked her if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports After much heated debate she said no However we then called Shanghai Pudong Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry They demanded that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports Therefore Ill need for you to provide me with the full names first middle last for everybody in your group Well then pass these on to the Wuxi agent who has already lined up the ShanghaiQingdao flight Well also provide the full names to agents wholl be setting up the other flights Secondly let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao Zang Bao Guo to line us up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote Jeff felt that the person fee was too much he stated that he had retirement savings to consider ha Weve spent the last couple days in negotiations with another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the same Beijing tour package at a more budgetminded price Today she gave us a rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package The estimated price would be about couple for the same five day package in Beijing This is in comparison to your price quite of person for a five day package We would downgrade from a star hotel to a star hotel its new Keep in mind that were still hammering out the details but the alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the wallet The crude itinerary would look something like this June fly to Beijing in the morning check into hotel tour the Forbidden City see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening June Great Wall Ding Temple tombs Beijing roast duck dinner June Temple of Heaven Summer Palace dinner at the Old Beijing Tea House singing and other entertainment provided June Tiananmen Square Beihai Park lunch at Beihai Kings Food Restaurant this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during the Qing Dynasty Yong He Gong Tibetan temple free evening June Hutong alley tour lunch at a Xinjiang Chinese Muslim cuisine restaurant Wangfujing Street shopping at the trendy stores Beijing opera in the evening June most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai We knocked out some destinations from the original plan For example the dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang antique shopping Ai Ping called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldnt be very interesting it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we see on TV every night The dance performance didnt include any minority group dances or traditional village styles so Ai Ping didnt think it sounded very Chinese If the antique shopping is desired its an onthestreet auction with other stores selling original and notsooriginal fake items we can slap it back on the itinerary I dont give a hoot either way I aim to please and we are extremely flexible Ai Pings hometown is six hours west of Beijing Shes been to Beijing a billion times she doesnt care where we go Let me know what you think and well do as instructed Thirdly I dont think well be needing any deposit money The airplane tix will be reserved in your names The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to have your ShanghaiQingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that you could pay there The QingdaoBeijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon arrival The Beijing agent hasnt mentioned a deposit for the tour package yet If she does Ill put the money down no problem So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do the Shanghai tour package your call It looks like a good plan to me If you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it Let me know Hope this gives you an idea on where were at Please respond asap with commentsquestions Hope all is swell in Tejas Will write again soon My Regards Jon Gillaspie From Daniel Junk To Jonathan Gillaspie CC Eric Gillaspie Subject Trip Details Date Fri May PDT Jon how is crisis management these days I hope it is coming together for you I hate to bother you but was wondering if Ai Ping has finalized anything with the travel agency or airlines Im sure there are going to be deposits required and such when the reservations are made Just let me know what youre needing from us In the mean time keep cool The suffering will end

FEATURESTEXAS LONGHORNS Pg LENGTH words HEADLINE How One College Program Runs The Business INSIDE LONGHORN INC BYLINE Roy S Johnson Research Associate Mary Danehy BODY Tom Hicks was beside himself He couldnt sit in one place And he couldnt stand He couldnt even bear to watch at times but the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate Furst the giant buyout firm also couldnt afford to turn away because this deal could go either way Im not talking about the companys pending million bet on an Internet outfit called Teligent Thats pocket change to a business managing more than billion in assets This was really big This was Saturday afternoons in the fall This was perky cheerleaders flying through the air and highstepping marching bands This was college football This was Texas On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin the University of Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few minutes on the clock at Darrell K RoyalTexas Memorial Stadium the teams newly renovated home A win would be huge The Cornhuskers perennial national title contenders were bigbully conference rivals and ranked third in the nation while the young Longhorns were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under secondyear coach Mack Brown Hicks is a proud and generous alum Texas Exes theyre called and hes deep into this Hook em Horns thing Two years ago he flew athletic director DeLoss Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown to Austin personally and he regularly counsels the coach on management matters He also advised Dodds about pricing financing and amenities when Texas built posh private suites at the stadium before last season In October he hosted a charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous TexasOklahoma weekend to benefit the schools sports programs He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas Stars but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns So its understandable that he was a bit on edge at the Nebraska game hosting a couple of dozen friends relatives and business associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the field at the Nebraska game Wearing a Longhorn burntorange shirt and surrounded by enough icecream bars and shrimp to satisfy an offensive line Hicks was anxious and animated Hey he yelled aint this something It sure is The University of Texas athletic program is at a pretty intriguing place in college sports With a surging young football team at its core it is one of the most successful college athletic programs in the country and Im not just talking about wins and losses This is a multimilliondollar enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a renegade campus outfit College sports has been a bigticket dance for some time now and this program is much like others at the toptier universities but there are a couple of exceptions The folks making the moves in Austin function more like CEOs than like traditional athletic directors and coaches and theyre making it work To determine how they do it I went back to school this fall and asked to take a close look at the books What I found was an operation that balances the athletic departments educational responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the costs of running a bigtime athletic program are surging and most college athletic programs are in the red I found a place where football pays the bills That was no surprise but this was Among the beneficiaries of bigtime football is a womens sports program that could be a model for gender equity In fact at the University of Texas the football Longhorns are Grade A cash cows Athletics officials credit the team with generating a staggering of the departments million from revenues in Thats million from tickets individual donations rights fees sponsorships hot dogs beer and other sources The athletic department operates much like a selfcontained corporation separate and apart from the rest of the university It has its core business football various auxiliary operations other mens and womens teams numerous revenue streams traditional corporate functions such as finance marketing public relations and HR you know it as recruiting and even sophisticated satellite officesdozens of alumni chapters nationwide through which athletics targets some Texas Exes for private gifts Got shareholders You bet More than of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays in the fall and they grade every move Mack Brown makes Think chasing quarterly expectations is brutal Try putting the success of your company in the hands of a bunch of to yearolds Hate talking to analysts Try answering Buck from Muleshoe Texas on a weekly callin talk show after losing a point lead in the fourth quarter Of course the whole thing is complicated by the fact that while a majorcollege athletic program must be managed with the diligence of a public company athletic directors dont have the luxury of shutting down unprofitable businessesat most schools that would be every sport save football and mens basketball And those wellpaid football coaches quite simply must win If we were a business we wouldnt have any sport but football and we would generate a heck of a profit says Dodds who is among the nations most respected athletic directors But were not about that We take the money we generate from football and use it to provide opportunities for other kids Then we try to balance what we want to accomplish inside the institution with what folks outside the institution want us to do Its a hard thing to do For more than a quartercentury one of the most difficult challenges for college sports has been finding a place for women Youve probably heard of Title IX the historic clause in the Education Amendments Act of that turned college sports on its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality for women in participation scholarship allocation recruitment spending and coaching resources The requirement forced athletic departments to essentially double their operations which helped spark the overall growth in college sports So whatever you think about the emphasis on college football hey it pays for womens soccer okay The Texas athletic departments budget is among the largest in the nation million for fiscal which ended in August Only four universities had fatter sports wallets that year Wisconsin million Tennessee million Michigan million and Ohio State No by far with a whopping million athletics budget If you think those who spend the most win forget it OSU is the only school of the group not ranked in the latest Top AP football poll How does UT get to its number For starters ticket sales and game guarantees payments to UT by a host school when the Longhorns play on the road generated million in revenue last year That category was exceeded only by private gifts which totaled an impressive million Other significant income categories included suitelease revenue million television money million payment for the teams Cotton Bowl appearance optional student fees sponsorships and advertising licensing revenue and concessions All told the department generated million in The athletic departments expenses totaled million That included scholarships valued at million for men and women administrative costs million for about employees and equipment purchases million The costs of running individual teams ranged from million for football to for tennis What caused the shortfall The final bills for a twoyear million capital improvement effort Remarkably the athletic department completed the project without a penny from the universitys academic funds It raised more than million in private donations in just over two years The department also took out million in bonds serviced now by lease and ticket revenues The bill was closed with million from the universitys Parking and Traffic division to fund a parking garage So what can you get for million Take a stroll down East Campus Drive near the stadium and youll pass the spiffy new million Mike A Myers Stadium and Soccer Field One block over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the country the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields million It was subsidized by yearold World War II veteran Frank A Denius a longtime fan who has attended practices most every day for as long as anyone can remember Beyond the suites at RoyalMemorial stadium UT added nearly new seats renovated major sections on both sides of the yearold facility and lowered the field three feet Why lower the field you ask I did too Better sightlines of course The stadium renovations cost million million to lower the field alone The department also spruced up its main offices now known as the MoncriefNeuhaus Complex If youve got an extra million you can get your name slapped on just about anything The place is Four Seasons plush Theres an impressive academic support center stocked with computers a hangarsized weight room that could inspire a couch potato and an overthetop football locker room any NFL team would envycustomcarved benches original art and lockers the size of small Manhattan apartments Mack Browns spacious office with a picture window overlooking the stadium field is trimmed in warm cherrywood and decorated with mementos and collectibles including a case of watches commemorating universities and bowl games where he has coached during his year career Photos from the Longhorn archives line the hallways and display cases in the lobby house the schools three national championship trophies and and the Heisman Trophy won by the man who is still the most powerful and exciting running back in college football history former Longhorn Earl Campbell Check out the intricate handcarved leather saddles in the cavernous players lounge Yep you can sit on the saddles and watch games If it all seems impossibly lavish there are reasons The stadium upgrade generates new revenue and the school had to build new facilities for its womens programs under requirements outlined in Title IX But perhaps the most vital reason is recruiting We had to stay sexy and attractive to the kids says Ed Goble UTs vice president of business affairs Youve got to provide an enhanced experience on campus to compete for the best kids CEO and COO would be more appropriate titles for Dodds and Brown the UT athletic director and head football coach Dodds a yearold former track coach got into sports administration because he liked working with coaches Today he has an associate athletic director who handles those duties Dodds is too busy closing new sponsorship deals negotiating Big Conference television and radio contracts gladhanding with boosters serving on NCAA committees and promoting his selfdescribed passiona college football championship tournament Dodds believes critics of a postseason tournament for college footballthe only major sport without a legitimate championship tournamentare after years of debate softening If it were to happen it would have to be approved within the next months says Dodds a window before negotiations for the next round of network television contracts kick into gear Dodds thinks a college football championship would generate about million for each of the or so schools playing Division IA football I think that over a sevenyear period a football playoff is worth several billion he says In the grand scheme of the college sports industry million may not seem like much but Dodds knows well that success comes with a price After last season when Brown took the Longhorns to a postseason bowl for the first time since Dodds ripped up the coachs original contract and signed him to a new tenyear deal worth million annually He added an annuity largely funded by private donors that will give Brown million annually at age should he remain another four years By the way Brown does earn more than the university president Dr Larry R Faulkner whose salary is So does basketball coach Rick Barnes who earns But if youre looking for the sort of acrimony between sports and academics that tears so many schools apart you wont find much of it here I have a lot of respect for Dodds his inventiveness and his way of keeping the organization attuned to opportunities says Faulkner Ive certainly paid attention to that The football coach actually gets to coach about as much as Bill Gates gets to play videogames these days His nine assistants structure and manage practices and deal with most routine player matters Brown like any toplevel executive is expected to be the companys outside guy Hes your COO with a whistle Most of his hours are filled with media obligations about two dozen television and radio stations and newspapers cover the Longhorns fundraising for the entire university as well as the athletic department and trying to keep his own management team in place After last season seven of his assistant coaches were offered head coaching jobs elsewhere Brown kept them all adding to the departments payroll Additionally five coaches were granted annuities worth to at age if they hang on with Brown for four more years On occasion Brown also telephones one of the many corporate executives who are big UT boosters guys like Hicks and San Antonio car dealer Red McCombs another alum and the owner of the NFLs Minnesota Vikings Brown looks to Hicks for timemanagement advice and insights on coping with pressure With McCombs he talks talent and tries to absorb some of the owners upbeat attitude Hey youre talking to one of only two owners whore going to the Super Bowl McCombs told Brown after an earlyseason Longhorn loss At the time the Vikings were One of the things thats common in both of them is that theyre high energy says Brown They have the ability to dream they have a lot of imagination and they dont get down very much In some areas though Brown is on his own The difference between their business and ours is that they can hire and fire who they want to the coach said one October afternoon while lounging on one of the plush leather couches in his office In my business we put our paychecks in the mouths of to yearolds we cant fire Its like that uglybaby theorywe cant get rid of them So we have to hug them and teach them better Another thingCEOs dont have to deal with mothers The major difference for us is the kids Browns kids were whooping it up with plus Longhorn faithful on that October afternoon when the pop of the final gun signaled the end of the Nebraska game Final score Texas Nebraska The victory was a turning point for the young Longhorns that propelled them to their finest season in years Going into their last regularseason game against Texas AM the Longhorns have their best record since winning ten games in albeit one that ended in an atmosphere of tragedy A week before the game students were killed and injured on the AM campus while building a huge bonfire structure for a pregame rally As FORTUNE went to press the game was scheduled to be played This year the Longhorns have been ranked as high as sixth in the AP Top their highest perch since Their reward A possible trip to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in January a prestigious bowl game despite its name Each team in the game receives million To put it another way the Nebraska victory paid off for the Longhorns like an Internet IPO So while Dodds appeared calm amid the postgame celebrations he was actually more relieved than anything If you dont win youre not doing your job he said And you dont survive There have been times of real doubt in recent years at UT athletics as the program struggled to find its way back to football prominence in the s But perhaps the most significant crisis occurred in when seven female athletes filed a lawsuit against the university charging that it had failed to comply with Title IX When the suit was filed about of UTs varsity athletes were women and female athletes received about million in scholarships well short of the million awarded to male varsity athletes Some executives inside the department wanted to fight the charges Recalls Jody Conradt UTs womens athletic director and head coach of womens basketball Some folks said Lets have a final war right here on the University of Texas campus and lets just see whos right Thankfully DeLoss and others said Thats not the way We need to sit down and come up with a solution Just three days after negotiations began the university settled essentially agreeing to all demands Today of the departments scholarship dollars are spent for female athletes who represent of UTs athletes Dodds believes that if the esteemed founders of college sports had not spurned female athletes from the start then the industry would not have endured the turmoil that ruling ignited Somebody somewhere made a big mistake he says Somebody somewhere decided women didnt need to be in sports and I dont know why we werent smart enough to fix it sooner The person most credited with nudgingsome say shovingTexas in the right direction on gender equity is Donna Lopiano a longtime activist for equity for women in sports and now head of the Womens Sports Foundation She became womens athletic director at the University of Texas in the first woman in the country to hold an AD title at a major university Like many advocates for gender equity she felt the university was dragging toward Title IX compliance but as a university official she could not openly encourage students to challenge the university Instead she handed out Title IX manuals and complaint forms from boxes she stashed behind her desk like candy at Halloween Must have done it hundreds of times for years she says laughing at the memory I had boxes of manuals and more boxes to replace them I couldnt believe it when somebody finally did it By it she means filed suit It took someone to be abrasive pushy and all the other adjectives her friends use for Donna says Conradt Donna scares people It wouldnt have happened any other way No question shes the most significant individual for what weve been able to achieve in womens athletics Today womens athletics at UT has its own corporate structure and hierarchy It shares resources with the men in many areas but it has its own management team led by Conradt who like Dodds reports to university vice president Pat Ohlendorf Only a handful of Division I programs are similarly structured I think young women need to see women as bosses Conradt says If the mens and womens departments merged how would women get the chance to run any of the areas This way we have role models for student athletes The women still have a long way to go before reaching parity in one critical areafundraising Last year gifts received by womens sports totaled only But the women are not without their boosters Red McCombs being the biggest Two events led McCombs to an epiphany regarding womens sports One came during what he described as a good ol Bubba meeting about fundraising a few years back When he asked the lone woman in the room to name the most generous donors for womens athletics he recalls She looked at me like I was crazy and said Mr McCombs there are none Soon afterward McCombs young granddaughter told him that she could not find a girls softball team to join He realized that wasnt going to change as long as the woman in the good ol Bubba meeting was right So four years ago he wrote a check for million to the UT womens athletic program the largest single gift to womens collegiate sports anyone can recall Earlier this year the Red and Charline McCombs Softball Stadium opened on UTs campus Title IX clearly stoked the growth in college sports programs a quartercentury ago but where will the money come from to sustain future growth Theres at least some concern that college sports is already locked squarely in corporate Americas cross hairs as the next sportsmarketing frontier For years only the likes of Nike Reebok and other sports brands had major deals with college teams Now hightech companies like eBay and Nextel are lining up alongside softdrink financialservices and entertainment companies to sell their products and services to your kids Companies once worried about being called crass for slapping logos on college campuses Today there is no shame Take the annual TexasOklahoma game the meeting of two of the most celebrated rivals in college football history For two years now it has been called the Dr Pepper Red River Shootout also sponsored by Southwestern Bell MercedesBenz Bank of America Miller Brewing and the Texas Land Cattle Co a local restaurant chain Its worth in excess of to each school Be very afraid For now corporate deals remain only a minor revenue source for most big colleges But as TV money and ticket prices peak and donors get short arms and cant reach their wallets after a couple of dog seasons youll see what I mean it could become the most vital source of future growth Texas new deal with Nike for instance provides UT athletics with up to million in Nike gear along with in cash annually for the next nine years Thats equal to the largest sponsorship deal in college sports and more than twice the value of the departments previous contract with Reebok While Dodds is mindful of the need to maintain some boundaries against unbridled commercialism hes more concerned that some major college programs may be forced out of bigtime football altogether because they cant keep up with escalating costs Sometimes the scale of all this makes Dodds wistful What Id like to do is maybe start over with this whole thing he says because its gotten to the point where you dont control it you manage it and its a challenge Nevertheless Texas is banking on being a leader in ecommerce for college sports Sales through its nascent Website are almost nil But with nearly a halfmillion Texas Exes out hereand Longhorn football on a rollthe upside is vast Hook em iHorns On that Saturday afternoon in the fall when the Longhorns grew up against Nebraska an elderly fan in dark glasses sat quietly on the front row of a luxury box at the stadium named in his honor Darrell Royal is still greeted as Coach Royal around Austin Hes in awe of his surroundings amazed that the program he helped build has become a multimilliondollar operation He never had to raise funds as a coach never had to do anything but coachand well fix the place up a bit When I first got here in there was a brokendown old shack in the end zone he says Caretaker lived there It took a few years but we finally got it torn down He laughed at another recollection He couldnt understand why fans refused to sit in an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and realized that there were no bathrooms up there Coach Royal doesnt much bother Dodds with advice anymore though he did mention one thing a while back I told him Nothing makes Texans as happy as winning and its happy folks that give Like any good executive Dodds listened well BOX STORY University of Texas Athletics Dept Revenue million FOOTBALL revenue million

Subject Coen Bros Coens hit most notes in Brother O Brother Where Art Thou Southern comedydrama color PG By Todd McCarthy Daily Variety Chief Film Critic CANNES Variety A musically tinged riff on The Odyssey set in the Depressionera Deep South O Brother Where Art Thou is a charming if lightweight Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and performance grace notes Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial cumulative impact which will likely translate into just OK box office results come domestic release in the fall While the films epigraph and inspiration come from Homer its title derives from Preston Sturges filmbiz classic Sullivans Travels in which the successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called O Brother Where Art Thou Despite appropriating the handle the Coens arent about to fall into the trap of pretentiousness themselves crafting instead a seriocomedy that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals with the leader Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney telling his cronies Pete John Turturro and Delmar Tim Blake Nelson that he knows where million is buried The first person they encounter however a blind black man driving a railway handcar warns them that they will find treasure out there but not the treasure theyre seeking A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology Its a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart he advises Everett stands by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism Picking up a young black musician Tommy Johnson Chris Thomas King on the road the fellows wander into an isolated radio stationrecording studio and posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys cut a lively tune and are paid a few bills for their efforts They then take off again and remain oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the lushly verdant landscapes which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in slightly washedout and burnished hues that are a constant delight They hook up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson a wonderfully livewired Michael Badalucco who hates his nickname Babyface and goes into a huge postcrime funk In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of visuals performance and music the boys come upon three sirens who seduce them in a watery glade when Pete disappears thereafter the dense Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad which he proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory oneeyed salesman for the word of God a Cyclopslike John Goodman squeezes the critter to death while beating the other two silly Pete eventually turns up again only to become perturbed when Everett reveals that his real goal rather than the nonexistent treasure is to reunite with the mother of his seven daughters Penny Holly Hunter who is about to marry another fellow In the course of things the errant adventurers brush up against local politics a governors race that pits old incumbent Pappy ODaniel Charles Durning against a reform candidate whose motto Friend of the Little Man is literally represented by a broomtoting dwarf who accompanies him at every campaign stop After slipping in a quiet homage to Sullivans Travels in which members of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a picture show the Coens deliver one of their major set pieces a stupendously choreographed Ku Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes the invasion of the Wicked Witchs castle by Dorothys friends in The Wizard of Oz Raucous thedevilgetshisdue musical climax is fun and given a big charge by Durning in a splendid performancecapping turn but is also rather too fairytaleish and toogoodtobetrue to truly satisfy leaving this an Odyssey without full closure Lack of irony and complexity in the wrapup may be a shortcoming but it also points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the films portrait of dimwits con men rednecks and country folk Most of the characters including the three leads may be dumb misguided and delusional but they are also engaging and straightforward to be enjoyed for the colorful oddballs that they are Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everetts vanity and in delivering the Coens carefully calibrated hightoned dialogue Turturro and Nelson a character actor who directed the indie Eye of God and the upcoming Othello update O are a real dumbanddumber combo without veering into slapstick while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness from Durning and wellknown regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root as the blind recording entrepreneur musician King as the boys sometime collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the escapees to the bitter end Not as elaborate as The Hudsucker Proxy or The Big Lebowski pic is nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins splendid camerawork blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassners evocative production design Mary Zophres imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are all but imperceptible as such watch for that cow Delta blues music a combo of T Bone Burnett and preexisting tunes is another major plus Everett Ulysses McGill George Clooney Pete John Turturro Delmar Tim Blake Nelson Pappy ODaniel Charles Durning Big Dan Teague John Goodman

PANEL Before Commissioners James J Hoecker Chairman Vicky A Bailey William L Massey Linda Breathitt and Curt Hebert Jr OPINION On March Clear Creek Storage Company LLC Clear Creek file d an application pursuant to section of the Natural Gas Act NGA for a certificate to convert a natural gas production reservoir to a natural gas storage facility to construct appurtenant facilities and to operate the storage field and related facilities for the sole use of Clear Creeks two owners Questar Energy Trading Company Questar Energy and Montana Power Ventures Inc Montana Power Clear Creek requests that to the extent feasible the authorization granted to it be a limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek also requests waivers of various Commission regulations and requirements For the reasons discussed below we will grant Clear Creeks request for authorization to convert the production reservoir to a gas storage facility and to construct and operate facilities However we will require Clear Creek t o operate the facility on an open access basis I Background Questar Energy and Montana Power formed Clear Creek to own and operate t he proposed Clear Creek storage project Questar Energy owns percent and Montana Power owns percent of Clear Creek Questar Energy is a whollyow ned subsidiary of Questar Corporation and a natural gas marketing affiliate of Questar Pipeline Company an interstate pipeline Questar Energy engages in marketing of natural gas crude oil and electricity It purchases natural gas from affiliated production companies and unaffiliated companies Montana Power is an affiliate of Montana Power Company an electric and gas utility regulated by the Commission as well as the State of Montana Montan a Power engages in natural gas business development which will include purchasing and selling natural gas upon approval of Clear Creeks application Clear Creek states that both Questar Energy and Montana Power plan to activ ely purchase and sell natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region and elsewhere i n the United States Therefore they both wish to develop storage capabilities to better manage their natural gas supplies including the balancing of their F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS respective natural gas supplies and supply acquisition opportunities with current and projected demand for natural gas Clear Creek states that the storage capacity will assist Questar Energy and Montana Power to buy and sell gas when it is most economically favorable to do so to offer more reliable supply products to potential customers and to manage transportation obligations to minimize exposure to penalties and cashout charges Clear Creek proposes to locate its storage project in the depleted Nugge t reservoir in the Clear Creek Field in Uinta County Wyoming an active natu ral gas production region Chevron Inc discovered the field in The fiel d produced gas from until when it was shutin after production of o il and gas from the field was no longer economic Prior to shutin wells produced natural gas that was delivered through existing pipeline facilitie s into Northwest Pipeline Corporation Kern River Gas Transmission Company a nd Questar Pipeline Company Clear Creek states that the interconnecting pipeline taps laterals gathering facilities and wells are still in place and with minor modifications will be used to transport gas in and out of the proposed storage facility Questar Energy has owned and operated the Clear Creek field since late having acquired it from its affiliate Universal Resources Corporation Universal a natural gas producer Universal tested the field in and and determined that the depleted oilgas reservoir in the Nugget formation can economically be converted to a storage project of up to Bcf of working ga s n Questar Energy plans to transfer its interests in the field to Clear Creek Footnotes n Universal requested and received an exemption pursuant to section cB of the NGA to test the Clear Creek field for a possible storage project to be undertaken by it or one of its affiliates See Universal Resources Corp FERC P Docket No CP End Footnotes II Proposal Clear Creek proposes to convert a reservoir in the Nugget formation in a depleted natural gas production field in the Clear Creek Participation Area PA of the Painter Reservoir Unit to a gas storage facility The Clear Creek PA is located in Uinta County Wyoming approximately miles northeast of Evanston The proposed project would reuse facilities in place within the Clear Creek PA from previous activities in Sections and of the production field Lands in Section are administered by the Bureau of Land Management BLM and lands in Section are owned privately by Uinta Livestock Grazing Partnersh ip The Nugget formation is located at an approximate depth of feet and storage will be water driven Clear Creek expects to operate the storage reservoir at a pressure of approximately psi Clear Creek proposes to develop Bcf of working storage capacity supported by to Bcf of cushi on gas Questar Energy and Montana Power will supply cushion gas in proportion to their membership interests The project is expected to have a maximum gas F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS injection capability of up to MMcfday at approximately psi and a maximum withdrawal capability of up to MMcfday at approximately ps i Clear Creek states that it will own and be responsible for operating the storage project Under the Construction Operation and Management Agreement between Clear Creek Questar Energy and Montana Power Clear Creek will contract with Questar Energy to operate the field on a day to day basis A Facilities Clear Creek states that conversion of the field to storage will require minimal construction and will enable it to maximize the use of existi ng facilities that were installed in connection with previous exploration and production activity at the field Clear Creek proposes to use a single existing well for injectio ns and withdrawals and up to existing wells for monitoring Clear Creek expe cts to use the existing roads pipeline facilities buildings fencing rightsofway pads and cleared areas and some of the existing storage tanks Clear Creek proposes to install the following new facilities two hp compressors possibly leased which will be installed in an existing building designed and historically used for compressors one JouleThompson Liquid Extraction Plant skid mounted which will be located in an already cleared fenced site new insulation wrapping and electric heat tracing for the existing injectionwithdrawal line that connects the injectionwithdrawal well to th e compressor building one gallon natural gas liquids storage tank located in an existi ng cleared fenced site a skidmounted production unit to separate water and free hydrocarbon liquids from the production stream during withdrawal operations two additional barrel water tanks to be located in predistur bed sites new inch tubing in the injectionwithdrawal well inside the existing inch casing and communications and monitoring equipment Clear Creek anticipates that it also will be necessary to modify existin g pipeline facilities that connect the field to Questar Pipeline Clear Creek expects Questar Pipeline to replace under its blanket construction certificate approximately feet of inch pipe and meter run with an equivalent lengt h of inch pipe and meter run Clear Creek requests authority to modify its lin e connected to the Clear Creek Field to accommodate those modifications by Questar Pipeline Clear Creek states that historically gas was delivered from the field into Questar Pipeline and was received from and delivered back to Questar Pipel ine during Universals well tests Clear Creek submits that in the future it F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS expects to receive gas from and deliver gas to other pipelines in the area including Northwest Pipeline Corporation and Kern River However Clear Cre ek does not seek approval at this time to construct any facilities necessary t o implement these additional receipt and delivery points B Services Clear Creek proposes to render storage services solely for its two membe rs Questar Energy and Montana Power which will receive storage capacity right s in direct proportion to their ownership interests ie Questar Energy will h ave use of percent of the fields storage capacity and Montana Power will ha ve use of percent of the capacity Questar Energy and Montana Power will al so have firm use of injection and withdrawal capabilities totaling MMcfd a nd MMcfd respectively on a percentage basis equal to the share of storage capacity rights Each will have a right to unused injection and withdrawal capabilities on an interruptible basis Clear Creek proposes to provide no storage service to any entity other than its owners Questar Energy and Montana Power will each own and store its own ga s in the capacity it holds C Requested Waivers Clear Creek states that it neither requests nor desires a blanket certificate to transport for others Therefore Clear Creek requests the Commission to waive any requirement that the proposed project be operated on an open access bas is Clear Creek submits that its proposal is different from the situations presented in two cases Total Peaking Services LLC Total Peakin g n and Hopkinton LNG Corporation Hopkinton n in which the Commission rejec ted private storage proposals involving existing liquid natural gas LNG facilities belonging to local distribution companies LDCs and required the applicant s to provide open access storage Unlike those cases Clear Creek maintains its proposed project is not located in a market area but in a supply area surrounded by both major production areas and major interstate pipelines In addition the reservoir Clear Creek proposes to convert to storage was not previously developed by a regulated LDC or any other form of regulated entity and thus there are no risks of crosssubsidies by ratepayers Further submits Clear Creek there are no concerns about an affiliated LDC engaging in capacity brokering to deliver gas to or from market area LNG plants a unique market advantage described by the Commission in Total Peaking Footnotes n FERC P n FERC P End Footnotes Further Clear Creek argues its proposal is for a small low budget project which cannot readily be increased in size to accommodate new demands for storage from a thirdparty without a great increase in associated costs and to a lesser extent environmental consequences Clear Creek also maintains that dilutio n of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the quantity of storage available to Questar Energy and Montana Power would undermine their incentives to proceed Clear Creek states that the project s costs would increase due to the sizable regulatory burdens associated with preparing and maintaining tariffs ratemaking utilitybased accounting practices reporting GISB EBBs additional personnel and marketingaffiliate rules requiring separation of Clear Creek from its two marketer owners Further it contends an open access requirement would expose it to economic risks a nd thirdparty liability issues such as risks of gas loss force majeure proj ect failure and credit that do not exist for a project that would only serve i ts two owners Accordingly Clear Creek requests waivers of all reporting requirements including the obligation to file Form or similar reports any obligation to file rates tariffs contracts or contract amendments any obligat ion to justify rates on any basis other than those the parties negotiated as pa rt of the Agreement any obligation to follow the Uniform System of Accounts any obligation to adhere to GISB standards or to maintain an EBB any obligatio n to separate personnel or otherwise to adhere to marketing affiliate rules as t hey might otherwise apply to the relationship between Clear Creek and its owner s n and any other rules or requirements that would otherwise apply to an open access pipeline or storage company Footnotes n Clear Creek acknowledges that Questar Energy would remain subject to the marketing affiliate rules as they apply to its dealings with Questar Pipeli ne Co End Footnotes III Interventions Notice of Clear Creeks application was published in the Federal Registe r on March Fed Reg Colorado Interstate Gas Company Natur

granted by the operation o f c of the Commissions regulations End Footnotes IV Discussion A Jurisdiction Since the proposed facilities will be used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce subject to the Commissions jurisdiction the requested authorization is subject to section c of the NGA B Public Convenience and Necessity Order No n was designed to encourage interstate pipelines to provi de F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS unbundled openaccess transportation Clear Creek proposes that the Commission make an exception for its storage proposal and not require it to provide o

proposed stor age facility is not in the market area and does not raise crosssubsidization o r capacity brokering issues We recognize that those issues are not present i n Clear Creeks proposal Nevertheless its proposal is the same in one overriding aspect Clear Creek seeks authorization to perform jurisdictional interstat e transportation with no requirement that such service be offered on an openaccess basis Such proposals are inconsistent with the regulatory goal s embodied in Order No which was intended to encourage interstate pipelines to provide openaccess services including storage Therefore we will requ ire Clear Creek to restructure its proposal into one that is consistent with th e principles of Order No Specifically we will issue Clear Creek a Part blanket transportation certificate conditioned on Clear Creeks filing wit hin days of the date of issuance of this order a revised Exhibit P to its application setting forth its proposed tariff and initial rates along with supporting schedules for openaccess firm and interruptible storage service and storagerelated transportation that comply with the requirement s of Part and with the Commissions restructuring rules as expressed in Orde r No To the extent Clear Creek seeks to charge marketbased rates it must ma ke a showing that it lacks market power The Commission has issued several order s that provide guidance on the criteria it uses to evaluate marketbased rate proposals n In addition an applicants marketbased study should be consistent with the Commissions policy statement on ratemaking n and must show among other things that a the relevant market provides good alternatives to the applicant and is not defined too broadly b the alternatives are timely c the applicant is not able to exercise market power over the price of the product and d the quality of service is equivalent Clear Creek should provide this information in the tariff filing required above Footnotes F PAGE

Alternatives to Traditional CostofService Ratemaking for Natural Ga s Pipelines FERC P End Footnotes Clear Creek requests a limited jurisdiction certificate The Commission issues such certificates to allow nonjurisdictional parties to engage in certain jurisdictional activities without affecting the status of their otherwise nonjurisdictional activities Since Clear Creeks sole function is to provi de interstate storage services there is no need to issue Clear Creek a limite d jurisdiction certificate However we clarify that the authorization grante d to Clear Creek will not affect the nonjurisdictional status of Questar Energy or Montana Power Because we are approving a Part blanket certificate rather than the limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek requested Clear Creek must comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to other natural gas companies providing Part service Accordingly we deny Clear Creeks request for waiver of those requirements We will not require Clear Creek to hold an open season since it has agreements with Questar Energy and Montana Power for all of the capacity of its proposed storage facility and no party has protested the arrangement Clear Creeks concern that an open access requirement for its storage facility would require it to enlarge its project is unfounded There is no requireme nt to offer more capacity than exists or to increase a facilitys capacity to accommodate potential customers An openaccess transporter need only offer on an openaccess basis existing capacity for which it has no contracts In th is regard we note that the agreement between Clear Creek and its two owners i s for all of the existing capacity for a term of twenty years Finally we note that Clear Creek may apply for a Part blanket certificate under which it could undertake future modifications to the stor age facilities and operations C Engineering The Commission has evaluated Clear Creekss proposal and concludes that the development of the Clear Creek reservoir as an underground gas storage fiel d is feasible We also evaluated the proposed storage design facilities capaci ty and injectionwithdrawal estimates and do not foresee any technical problem s regarding the development of this field Accordingly in view of these circumstances we will require that The maximum inventory of natural gas stored in Clear Creek shall not exceed Bcf at psia and degrees F and the maximum shutin bott om hole reservoir pressure shall not exceed psig without prior Commissio n authorization and F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Clear Creek shall submit semiannual reports in accordance with section c of the regulations These reports shall continue to be filed unt il one year after the storage inventory volume has reached or closely

Before Commissioners Elizabeth Anne Moler Chair Vicky A Bailey Jame s J Hoecker William L Massey and Donald F Santa Jr OPINION On December TexasOhio Pipeline Inc TexasOhio filed an application pursuant to section c of the Natural Gas Act NGA and Parts and of the Commissions regulations for certificates of public convenie nce and necessity to operate its facilities in interstate commerce and to perfo rm openaccess transportation services on existing facilities known as the Hun ter Pipeline in Garrard County Kentucky TexasOhio also requested a temporary certificate to operate the Hunter

intervene out of time For good cause shown and since the late intervention will not prejudice any party to this proceeding or otherwise delay the proceeding we will grant Energy Marketings motion to intervene out of time Background The Hunter Pipeline is an interconnection between facilities of Tennesse e Gas Pipeline Company Tennessee and TETCO It consists of two horsepower compressors and approximately feet of aboveground inch diameter gas pipeline The Hunter Pipeline is capable of transporting Mcf per day of natural gas TexasOhio constructed the Hunter Pipeline pursuant to a certificate iss ued by the Kentucky Public Service Commission Kentucky PSC on November This authorization designated TexasOhio as an intrastate pipeline operatin g as a transporting utility However because TexasOhio did not hold an openseason prior to commencing transportation operations only TexasOhio Gas Inc an d its sales customers acquired capacity on the Hunter Pipeline n After constructing the facilities TexasOhio filed an application with the Commission in Dock et No PR seeking approval of rates under section a of the Natural Gas Policy Act NGPA The Commission instituted rate proceedings on April to determine whether TexasOhios rates were fair and equitable n n TexasOhio is a whollyowned subsidiary of TexasOhio Gas Inc TOG a Houstonbased marketer that ships Gulf Coast gas to northeastern industrial endusers via Tennessee and TETCO Prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline TOG faced separate bottlenecks on the Tennessee and TETCO systems during th e winter heating season the location and capacity of the Hunter Pipeline was selected to avoid these bottlenecks n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC On June TexasOhio suspended transportation service through the Hunter Pipeline upon discovering that the gas being moved through those facilities was not produced in Kentucky and therefore that it was engaged in F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the interstate transportation of natural gas without authorization under NG A section or NGPA section Subsequently the Commission instituted an investigation into the construction and operation of the Hunter Pipeline T hat investigation determined that from the first day of operation on December through its voluntary shutdown on June the Hunter Pipeline transported gas in interstate commerce n On October the Commiss ion approved a stipulation and consent agreement in which TexasOhio agreed to pay a civil penalty and to implement a program to comply with the NGA a nd NGPA n n TexasOhio received all the gas that flowed through the Hunter Pipeli ne from Tennessees interstate facility TexasOhio then redelivered the gas t o TETCOs interstate facility n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Proposal TexasOhio requests authorization to operate its facilities in interstat e commerce and perform openaccess transportation service TexasOhio proposes to charge firm shippers a transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of per MMBtu and a commodity charge of per MMBtu Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of per MMBtu nn The proposed initial rates are the same as those which TexasOhio was authorized to charge during the effectiveness of the temporary certificate TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at TexasOhio states that operation of the Hunter Pipeline will permit shippers to avoid bottlenecks on the systems of Tennessee and TETCO TETCOs bottlen eck is located at a point near the KentuckyTennessee border Due to this constraint TETCO has historically curtailed the interruptible transportati on of natural gas from receipt points located south of the Kentucky Tennessee border that is destined for delivery to points north during the winter heating season During the past three winter seasons TETCO has curtailed interruptible transportation for gas originating upstream of its Mt Pleasant compressor station in Tennessee that is scheduled for delivery downstream to Zon es C and D The bottleneck on Tennessees system occurs in Mercer County Pennsylvan ia As a result gas produced and transported from receipt points south of Merc er County cannot be transported to points north of Mercer County during certai n periods of the year During the past four winter seasons Tennessee has curtailed gas moving on an interruptible basis from points upstream of stations and to locations downstream of those stations TexasOhios facilities are positioned to avoid both bottlenecks In thi s regard Tennessee typically has interruptible transportation capacity for deliveries to Texas Ohios facilities but has bottlenecks downstream of i ts interconnection with TexasOhio Conversely TETCO has a bottleneck upstrea m of TexasOhios facilities but has capacity for the movement of interruptible transportation volumes downstream of its Mt Pleasant compressor station A s such TexasOhios facilities can be utilized to alleviate bottlenecks on t wo different pipeline systems and thereby move gas to markets in the Northeast F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Discussion The Commission finds that by utilizing the Hunter Pipeline shipper s located upstream of the TETCO bottleneck can utilize Tennessees system to move gas to TexasOhio for redelivery to TETCO and continued transportation downstream Shippers upstream of Tennessees bottleneck but downstream of TexasOhios facilities can by displacement utilize TexasOhios system to access the TETCO system for continued transportation downstream This arrangement will avoid both the upstream and downstream bottlenecks and all ow continued delivery of gas to various northeast markets located off both the TETCO and Tennessee systems We find that the public convenience and necess ity requires issuance of a certificate pursuant to Part subpart A authorizing operation of TexasOhios Hunter Pipeline The Commission also finds that TexasOhios pro forma tariff generally complies with the requirements for a Part blanket transportation certificate Accordingly we will grant Texas Ohios application for a Par t blanket transportation certificate subject to the conditions set forth her ein to ensure TexasOhios full compliance with the conditions of Order Nos and TexasOhios Part blanket certificate will become effecti ve upon TexasOhios full compliance with these conditions I Rates TexasOhio proposes to charge the initial rates that were approved in th e temporary certificate Under this proposal firm shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of per MMBt u and a commodity charge of per MMBtu Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of per MMBtu The proposed rates are based on the modified fixed variable rate design MFV percent equity capitalization a percent return on equity and a perc ent depreciation The reservation and usage charges are based on percent of the system design capacity A Rate Design Order No requires pipelines to use the straight fixed variable SFV rate design methodology n TexasOhio has not provided any evidence which would support an exception to this requirement Accordingly we find that TexasO hio should be required to use the SFV rate design methodology Additionally si nce TexasOhios cost of service does not include any variable costs we will require it to use as the minimum FTS usage and ITS rates n n See CFR d n See Gateway Pipeline Co FERC B Capitalization and Rate of Return TexasOhio proposes a capitalization consisting of percent equity W e find that it is appropriate to use a hypothetical capital structure consist ing of percent debt and percent equity this structure is based on the percent average equity ratio held by a group of seven major investor owned interstate pipelines at the end of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS We have generally used recent rates for Baarated public utility bonds t o set the debt costs on similar projects since Baa is the prevailing rating for pipeline bonds The rate for Baa utility bonds averaged percent for th e six months ending July with a one month average of percent for J uly We find it appropriate to utilize a cost of debt of percent TexasOhios proposed percent rate of return on equity is excessive considering the prevailing cost of capital We find acceptable a rate of return derived from a range of returns based upon an analysis of recent interest rates and a discounted cash flow DCF study The lower end of the range is determined by the prevailing Baa rating for public utility bonds as discussed above we will use a figure of percent for the most recent six months Si nce equity is riskier than debt basis points should be added to the bond rate thus bringing the lower end of the range to percent The upper end of the range is determined by a DCF analysis of a proxy gr oup of seven publicly held natural gas transmission companies n This proxy group is used because the DCF methodology requires market price data as an input in the estimation of investorexpected equity returns The DCF analysis for th e proxy group results in a range of equity returns of percent to percent with a median return of percent n Coastal Corporation El Paso Natural Gas Company Enron Corporation Panhandle Eastern Sonat Inc Transco Energy and Williams Companies Inc This analysis uses dividend yields and forecasts of long term growth ra tes as follows For the first five years the Institutional Brokerage Estimate System IBES estimates of five year growth in earnings per share was used For longerterm growth for the years estimates taken from DRIMcGr aw Hill Energy Review SpringSummer for growth in the natural gas industry were used A growth rate for each company in the proxy group was determined by averaging the two growth rates Combining the bottom and top figures establishes a range of percent to percent The midpoint of this range is approximately percent The Hunter Pipeline went into initial operation in and faces no construction risk Accordingly we find that the companys risk is no highe r than that of the average pipeline Therefore we will require a rate of ret urn on equity of percent which is equal to the midpoint of the range of reasonableness C Depreciation TexasOhio proposes a book depreciation rate of percent calculated on the straightline method which supports an economic life of years We believ e that the economic life of the Hunter Pipeline will depend upon gas reserves connected to the Tennessee system and the future demand for natural gas downstream of those facilities We are confident that market demand and operation of Tennessee and TETCO to service downstream markets in the Northeast States will continue for the next years We also believe that the Hunter Pipeline will operate on a permanent basis and play an important role in th e delivery of gas especially during high demand periods Based on the se factors we find that an economic life of years should be used to calculate a depreciation rate of four percent for the Hunter Pipeline facilities F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS D Conclusion We will require TexasOhio to modify its rates as follows For interruptible service the minimum rate shall be the maximum rate shall be For firm service the minimum reservation charge shall be the maximum reservation charge shall be The usage charge for firm service sha ll be n The rates approved herein are initial rates under NGA section their approval does not constitute approval of any underlying rate methodology principle or concept to be used in any general rate change filed pursuant to NGA section These initial rates will remain in effect until such time as TexasOhio files an NGA section general rate proceeding At that time an y party or the Commission staff may propose new rates based on different methodologies principles or concepts n All rates are expressed per MMBtu II Pro Forma Tariff TexasOhio has applied for a blanket transportation certificate under secti on of the Commissions regulations It proposes to provide bot h firm and interruptible transportation service To commence service under a blanket certificate TexasOhio must file and place into effect rates term s and conditions that are consistent with Part of the regulations TexasOhio has not made a tariff filing in this proceeding it has however filed pro forma tariff sheets which indicate the form its tariff will take Generally the pro forma tariff conforms to the Commissions requirements As discussed below however certain provisions are either inconsistent with the Commissions policies or are not adequately justified Certain specific changes that we will require to be made to TexasOhios pro forma tariff are set forth in an appendix to this order A Order No Review of TexasOhios pro forma tariff indicates a number of changes th at must be implemented to satisfy the requirements of Order No To implem ent those changes TexasOhio must make a tariff filing within days of the d ate of the issuance of this order Also TexasOhio is reminded that while cert ain provisions of Order No may not apply at this time future changes in i ts operations may require tariff revisions to satisfy the requirements of that Order Equality of ServiceOpen Season Pipelines that offer openaccess transportation service must provide tho se services on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas suppliers whether the gas is purchased from the pipeline or from another seller Section biv of the Commissions regulations CFR biv requires a pipelines tariff to reflect the principle of equality of service for all gas transpor ted under each rate schedule TexasOhio performs only unbundled transportation service it does not provide pipeline sales service TexasOhio does however provide transportation service for its affiliated marketers TOG and TexasOhio West Inc Origina l Sheet No section of TexasOhios pro forma tariff provides that F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS customers with an already executed firm transportation contract for service on the Hunter Pipeline as of the effective date of the tariff shall have a priority over customers executing a service agreement at a later date Service is otherwise offered on a firstcome firstserved basis We find that this provision gives preferential treatment to selected customers It is unduly discriminatory and must be removed from the tariff Further we find that TexasOhio has never held an openseason or otherwise provided for the nondiscriminatory allocation of system capacity prior to initiating servic e Accordingly we hold that TexasOhio must implement an open season within days of the date of issuance of an order in this proceeding to ensure non discriminatory allocation of system capacity Pregranted Abandonment and Right of First Refusal Section d of the Commissions regulations CFR d authorizes pregranted abandonment of interruptible and shortterm firm transportation at the end of the contract A shortterm contract is one wit h a term of less than one year For longterm transportation with a term of mor e than a year section bxiii requires the pipeline to establish right of first refusal procedures for use upon expiration of the longterm contra ct TexasOhios pro forma tariff does not comply with these requirements it i s directed to amend its tariff accordingly Capacity Release and Electronic Bulletin Board Section of the Commissions regulations CFR requires interstate pipelines offering firm transportation to establish a capacity release mechanism that allows firm shippers to release all or part of their firm transportation capacity rights to any person who wants to obtain that capac ity by contracting with the pipeline The release may be temporary permanent or subject to conditions ie on an interruptible basis The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate not ove r the maximum rate and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the release Order No requires pipelines to provide timely and equal access to a ny and all information necessary for buyers and sellers to arrange gas sales a nd capacity release including information regarding the availability of capac ity at receipt and delivery points and whether capacity is available from the pipeline directly or through capacity releasing This information must be posted on an electronic bulletin board EBB TexasOhios proposed tariff lacks these provisions It must amend its p ro forma tariff to provide a capacity release mechanism and establish an EBB Upstream Capacity Section of the Commissions regulations CFR provide s that an interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subparts B or G of Part must offer without undue discrimination to assign to its firm shippers its firm transportation capacity including contract storage on all upstream pipelines TexasOhio does not appear to hold any upstream capacity In the tariff filing it is required t o make to comply with the requirements of Order No TexasOhio should st ate whether it holds any capacity on upstream pipelines If it does TexasOhio must F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS revise its tariff to comply with Order No Transition Costs TexasOhios filing predates Order No and consequently makes no comment regarding incurrence of transition costs Accordingly we will not make a determination at this time with respect to TexasOhios level of transition costs III Docket No MT Pursuant to our order of December TexasOhio filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No MT to comply w ith the requirements of section b CFR b n With the exception of the items discussed below we find that TexasOhios filing complies with those requirements n n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Section of the Commissions regulations requires interstate natural gas pipelines that transport natural gas for others pursuant to subparts B G H or K of Part and that are affiliated in any way with a natural gas marketing or brokerin g entity to file certain information relevant to that relationship n On June Order No modified section b effective August by among other things eliminating the requirement that pipelines receive certain information from shippers in requests for transportation service log and post on the EBB complaints made by shippers and include procedures to communicate pricing and capacity information The tariff sheets filed by TexasOhio do not set forth the information required to be filed in a transportation request TexasOhio contends that since it is operating under a temporary certificate and is prohibited from provid ing transportation service to new customers pending further action on its application that information is not applicable While Order No eliminated certain information previously required t o be provided in the transportation request form it still requires pipelines to maintain a log of data used to allocate capacity TexasOhio must comply wi th this provision and file a transportation request form as specified TexasOhio can address this deficiency by either revising existing tarif f provisions including its FTS and ITS request form or by incorporating the changes into Section Order No Compliance Procedures of its propos ed tariff TexasOhio must make a compliance filing within days of the issuance of this order incorporating all information required by Order Nos and Additionally since the tariff sheets TexasOhio filed in Docket No MT are not pro forma TexasOhio should filed corrected tariff sheets in a for m acceptable to become effective upon issuance of an order in this proceeding IVEnvironmental Matters On August TexasOhio notified the Commission that it intended to commence construction of the Hunter Pipeline and that the facilities would be used for the transportation of natural gas under NGPA section a Th is notice provided the environmental information required by section d of the Commissions regulations F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS To ensure that operation of the Hunter Pipeline compressors complies wit h the noise requirements of section d TexasOhio must perform a postconstruction sound survey of the compressor station This survey must be performed not later than days after the date of issuance of this order n TexasOhios application for a Part subpart A certificate to operate t he Hunter Pipeline and a Part subpart G blanket transportation certificat e relies solely on the use of existing facilities no additional construction authorization is requested or granted Accordingly subject to TexasOhios compliance with section d we conclude that approval of the instant application is not a major Federal action significantly affecting th e quality of the human environment n Section d provides that the noise attributable to any compressor facility shall not exceed a daynight sound level of dBA at any existing noisesensitive areasV IESCOs Protest In its protest and request for an evidentiary hearing IESCO charges tha t TexasOhios jurisdictional status must be determined as a precondition to the issuance of a certificate IESCO states that if TexasOhio was not a interstate pipeline for the period from November through June it could not legally offer NGPA section a service and competing sellers of gas such as IESCO could have b een unfairly deprived of their markets The Commissions January order issuing TexasOhio a temporary certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline laid to rest concerns regarding TexasOhios jurisdictional status Further TexasOhio agreed in the settlement approved in the Commissions October order to comply with the NGA NGPA and the Commissions regulations This order issues TexasOhio a case specific certificate pursuant to subpart A of Part and a blanket transportation certificate pursuant to subpart G of Part No questions remain as to the jurisdictional status of TexasOhio IESCO then complains that TexasOhio should have held an openseason dur ing which prospective shippers would have an opportunity to obtain services on the Hunter Pipeline As discussed above the Commission has investigated TexasOhios operation and determined among other things that TexasOhio notified only its marketing affiliate and the marketing affiliates custome rs of the availability of capacity prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline The Commissions policies require TexasOhio to use a nondiscriminatory method of selecting customers for both firm and interruptible transportation service when operating under Part n As noted above we are holding that TexasOhi o must hold an open season prior to commencing service under its Part blanket certificate This approach will ensure that prior notice of firm capacity i s made available to all interested parties on a contemporaneous basis and in a nondiscriminatory manner n n CFR b and b n See eg Pacific Gas Transmission Co FERC at ANR Storage Co FERC at IESCO next asserts that TexasOhios proposed tariff does not assure tha t nondiscriminatory service will be provided We disagree Acceptance by F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS TexasOhio of the blanket transportation certificate authorized by this ord er and as conditioned herein will subject TexasOhio to the full range of the Commissions requirements including those prohibiting discriminatory practices IESCO states that TexasOhio must be required to comply with the provisi ons of the Affiliated Marketer Rule As we noted in the order issuing a tempora ry certificate Order Nos and A apply to all interstate pipelines wit h affiliated marketers Upon acceptance of the temporary certificate Texas O hio became subject to the conditions of those orders n TexasOhios standard s of conduct implementing Order No filed in Docket No MG have be en accepted by the Commission n When TexasOhio complies with this orders directions TexasOhio will be in full compliance with Order No n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC Texas Ohio Pipeli ne Inc FERC IESCO asserts that TexasOhios proposed rates have not been shown to be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity It is particularly concerned with the fact that TexasOhio seeks to depreciate it s facilities over a tenyear period As discussed above we agree that TexasOhios proposed rates and tenyear depreciation period are inappropriate and we have required adjustments to those figures as appropriate IESCO also raises in its protest issues relating to Texas Ohios application for a temporary certificate Those issues were addressed in our January order issuing a temporary certificate Issues raised by IESCO on rehearing of that order are discussed below In view of our disposition of the issues raised by IESCO we find that there are no disputed material issues of fact and therefore no need for an evidentiary trialtype hearing n n See Arkla Gathering Services Co FERC VI Request for Rehearing On February IESCO filed a request for rehearing of the Commissions January order issuing TexasOhio a temporary certificate IESCO contends first that issuance of the temporary certificate to TexasO hio was unlawful on three grounds the Commission acted beyond its statutor y authority because it improperly determined that an emergency existed e ven if an emergency existed the Commission failed to make adequate findings supported by substantial evidence and the Commission failed to resolve jurisdictional and tariff issues in connection with issuance of the tempora ry certificate NGA section cB provides that the Commission may issue a tempora ry certificate in cases of emergency to assure maintenance of adequate servic e or to serve particular customers without notice or hearing pending the determination of an application for a permanent certificate The order issuing a temporary certificate expressly found that an emergency exists within the meaning of section cB of the Natural Gas Act and section of the Commissions regulations and that the public convenience and necessity required the issuance of a temporary certificate authorizing TexasOhios F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS operation of the Hunter Pipeline in order to continue service to existing customers who had been relying on that service n In support thereof the order referenced the fact that Raritan River Steel Company the largest employer in Perth Amboy New Jersey would be forced to purchase gas at a higher price and might have to close its plant with disastrous impacts on t he community and a number of entities including the Philadelphia Housing Authority the Dartmouth Finishing Corporation and various schools indicat ed that they are operating under strained budgets and that the inability to transport gas on TexasOhio would result in severe fiscal restraints n TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at Under these circumstances we believe that an emergency situation was sh own to exist within the standard established by NGA section and that this conclusion is appropriately supported by the evidence relied upon in the order n n See generally PennYork Energy Corp FERC Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp FERC With regard to its assertion that the Commission failed to resolve certa in jurisdictional and tariff issues prior to the issuance of the temporary certificate IESCO complains that i the Commission issued a temporary certificate without making a finding that TexasOhio is a natural gas company subject to the Commissions NGA jurisdiction ii the failure to resolve t he jurisdictional issue leaves unresolved the question of whether a certificat e of public convenience and necessity is needed for the construction of the Hunt er Pipeline and iii the Commission has left unresolved the question of whet her an openseason is required to assure nondiscriminatory access to TexasOhi os facility thus precluding shippers who were denied service from any opportunity to obtain service during the period that the temporary certificate is in effect IESCOs arguments misapprehend the function of a temporary certificate By its very nature issuance of a temporary certificate precedes decisions on matters related to issuance of the permanent certificate The issues raised by IESCO are appropriate for decision in connection with the issuance of a permanent certificate and we have addressed them above n n We in fact noted in the January order that the issues raise d by IESCO relating to the jurisdictional status of TexasOhio and the provision of service on a nondiscriminatory basis would be resolved upon consideration o f the application for a permanent certificate We stressed at that time that the grant of a temporary certificate is made to allow the resumption of service by specific customers previously utilizing TexasOhios facilities to prevent hardship TexasOhio Pipeline Inc FERC at IESCO also asserts that the Commission improperly refused to order an evidentiary hearing before issuing the temporary certificate IESCO alleges that efforts in Docket No PR to determine the original and ultimate destination of gas transported by TexasOhio were unsuccessful It also sta tes that the proceedings in Docket No PR and the instant docket have b een plagued by uncertainty over the identity of Texas Ohios customers and the nature of the services rendered We disagree that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the issuan ce of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS the temporary certificate NGA section c does not require either notice or hearings in conjunction with the issuance of a temporary certificate Even where the statute requires an evidentiary trialtype hearing it is necessary on ly where material issues of fact are in dispute that cannot be resolved on the basis of the written record n The matters raised by IESCO are speculativ e or immaterial to the decision to issue a temporary certificate to allow the resumption of specific services to specific customers Finally IESCO alleg es that the Commission failed to attach conditions needed to prevent abuse of the temporary certificate IESCO states that the temporary certificate should have been expressly limited to serving customers previously served through the Hunter Pipeline and that it should have included a condition for potential refunds n Arkla Gathering Service Co FERC Our January order specifically provided that the temporary certificate is not a blanket authorization but is limited to only those customers with whom TexasOhio has existing transportation agreements n The order further specified that the grant of a temporary certificate is made t o allow the resumption of service by specific customers previously utilizing the Hunter Pipeline n Thus the temporary certificate expressly limited serv ice to existing customers Finally the NGA does not provide for making initial rates subject to refund n Id at n Id at The Commission Orders A Upon the terms and conditions of this order a certificate of public convenience and necessity is issued to TexasOhio pursuant to subpart A of Part of the Commissions regulations as amended from time to time authoriz ing it to operate the Hunter Pipeline in interstate commerce B The certificate issued in Order Paragraph A above is conditioned u pon TexasOhios compliance with Part and paragraphs a c e and g of section of the Commissions regulations C Upon the terms and conditions of this order a blanket certificate o f public convenience and necessity is issued to TexasOhio authorizing it to perform the activities specified in subpart G of Part of the Commission s regulations as amended from time to time The certificate issued to TexasOhio in Ordering Paragraph A above is conditioned upon TexasOhios acceptance of this blanket certificate D Upon the terms and conditions of this order permission for and approval of the abandonment by TexasOhio of the services authorized in subpart G of Part of the Commissions regulations as amended from time to time are granted E The certificate issued in Ordering Paragraph C above the abandonm ent authorized in Ordering Paragraph D above and the rights granted thereund er are conditioned on TexasOhios compliance with the applicable Commission regulations under the NGA including Parts and and paragraph s a and e of section of the Commissions regulations F TexasOhio must make a filing within days of the date of issuance of F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS this order revising its tariff to implement the requirements of Order No G TexasOhio must make a filing in Docket No MT

of this order J IESCOs protest and request for a hearing is denied K Energy Marketing Exchanges petition for leave to intervene out of time is granted L The motions of TexasOhio and IESCO to file answers dated December and January respectively are granted APPENDIX APPENDIX Pro Forma Tariff Analysis Specific Comments Rate Schedules FTS andor ITS Section Availability In this section TexasOhio reserves the right in its sole judgement exercised on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis to decline service whenever it would be contrary to good operational practices or detrimental to other customers Texas Ohio should revise this section to set out the specific criteria or detrimental actions that would trigger this clause Section iii of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provi de TexasOhio with acceptable evidence of among other things gas supply market and other transportation services The term acceptable is vague a nd subject to unduly discriminatory interpretation TexasOhio must set forth specifically the evidence required to be acceptable Section Applicability and Character of Service Section of Rate Schedule ITS states that transportation will be subjec t to curtailment or interruption as deemed necessary in TexasOhios discretion The provision is vague and could result in unduly discriminatory application of curtailment procedures TexasOhio must modify the provision to detail the specific operational characteristics and criteria used to determine the conditions and need for curtailment Section Priority and Interruption of Transportation Service F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides for firm service on a fir st come first served basis However TexasOhio retains a priority for custom ers with existing FTS agreements This provision is unduly discriminatory and m ust be removed from the tariff Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides that TexasOhio can curtail service due to reasons of force majeure or any other operational considerations to be reasonably determined by Texas Ohio TexasOhio must set forth the specif ic operational considerations it would rely upon in exercising this authority In Section of Rate Schedule FTS and Section of Rate Schedule ITS TexasOhio proposes to suspend service if a shippers account is unpaid for days TexasOhio can suspend service without prior Commission approval if a customer fails to pay a billed amount within days of the due date but o nly where days notice is given and the shipper neither pays the bill nor provides guarantee of payment TexasOhio must modify these provisions to provide fo r a day notice period Section Requests for Transportation Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS states that a shipper must comple te a FTS or ITS Request Form however no request form is included TexasOhio must establish a request form as part of its tariff That form m ust comply with the requirements of Order No as set forth in section b of the Commissions regulations Section Operating Conditions Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provide TexasOhio with estimates of gas to be transported and such other operating data as TexasOhio may require This section should be amended to specify what other operating data may be required of shippers Section of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS specifies that TexasOhio will not provide service on any day for which all necessary upstream and downstream arrangements cannot be confirmed This clause should be amended to state th at any action will be taken on a nondiscriminatory basis Section Rates Section of Rate Schedule FTS defines the monthly reservation and commod ity usage charge TexasOhio should insert the word maximum in the second sentence prior to monthly commodity charge and unit commodity rates Section Waivers Section of Rate Schedule FTS provides that TexasOhio may waive any right s hereunder or any obligations of a customer on a basis which is not unduly discriminatory This language creates the impression that TexasOhio retai ns the discretion to waive default by the shipper of any provision in the tari ff This would give TexasOhio excessive latitude in operating under its tariff and provide an opportunity for undue discrimination among shippers Waiver provisions are permissible but they must serve a functional purpose and operate under a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances TexasOhio must specify the criteria it will use in determining whether to waive a particul ar F PAGE FERC P FERC LEXIS provision General Terms and Conditions TexasOhios pro forma tariff contains no scheduling or imbalance penalties Pipelines are permitted but not required to impose penalties to maintain control of their system If scheduling or imbalances become a problem in th e future Texas Ohio can make a tariff filing to propose appropriate penalti es Section Transporter Receipt Points Section provides that TexasOhios obligation to receive and deliver gas shall never exceed the total daily volume Shipper is able and willing to receive TexasOhio must remove the words and willing from this provision The phrase is vague and could lead to discriminatory activities Section Nominations and Balancing Deliveries Section provides that a shipper will inform TexasOhio daily or on so me other basis as Transporter may reasonably require pursuant to such other procedures as may be established and published by Transporter from time to time of the daily gas quantity The phrase is vague and should be repla ced with language specifying what other basis for notification is required eg phone fax or telecopy Section requires shippers to give TexasOhio notice hours in adva nce or as Transporter may designate from time to time of any change in the da ily quantity TexasOhio

Gerald Nemec PM To Dan J NRON cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Barbara Gray Teresa G CT Subject Re Summary of Tom Brown Meeting Confidential Work Product Attorney Client Privilege Dan Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution As the situation stands now Wildhorses possible responses to the letter are as follows Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment If they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo one of which is release of the gas You are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives That is a risk I pointed out early However in our letter to Wildhorse I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of weeks If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice A Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract This will take time Depending on court docket loads months to year B Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by Wildhorse and that we will build our own system Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms The only complication is that under the contract Wildhorses obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream Depending on Wildhorses flow dynamics and our plant placement Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas After your field meeting and our engineering assessment hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal I would very directly ask them under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees They dont have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability Dan J NRON PM To Gerald CT cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Subject Summary of Tom Brown Meeting I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today I met with the Business Development Director Bob Mustard Tom Brown as owner of Wildhorse is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems quality pressure et al currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo and other producers low Btu gas they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology I passed all this info on to KenJim Heres the interesting partBob discussed confidentially that for the past monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buyout of Kinder Morgans interest in Wildhorse they have a righttomatch provision in their LLC agreement The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt Kinder Evans If they are successful which he thinks TBI will be then TBI will turnaround and look to spin off the nonstrategic systems like the Piceance Basin assets to third party purchasers This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with WildhorseWildhorse has been slowplaying negotiations since I first met with them in late May and above may be the reason why Now that weve sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting essentially to clarify their understanding status of the contracts so we can get to work my feeling based on the transaction between KMI TBI is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete how much longer will this take Of course if the transaction is completed TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system so even if ENA is interested will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested The point is thisIm

Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Alamodome Nebraska vs Texas Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo the Texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up he empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the basketball game TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Centermuch less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughterIve been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order shots of tequila and three beers Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is We give him and tell him to keep it There is a minute wait We give the hostess We are seated immediately We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads onthe table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons

CHILI TASTER These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK who was visiting Texas from New Jersey and fell into it Recently I was lucky enough to be the th attendee at the State Fair in Texas and was asked to fill in to be a judge at a chili cookoff Apparently the original judge called in sick at the last moment and I happened to be standing there when the call came in I was assured by the other two judges Native Texans that it would be a fun event and a true taste of Texas hospitality They assured me that the chili wouldnt be all that spicy and besides they told me I could have free beer during the tasting so I accepted Here are the scorecards from the event Chili Mikes Maniac Mobster Monster Chili JUDGE ONE A little too heavy on tomato Amusing kick JUDGE TWO Nice smooth tomato flavor Very mild FRANK Holy shit what the hell is this stuff You could remove dried paint from your driveway with it Took me two beers to put the flames out Hope thats the worst one These Texans are crazy Chili Arthurs Afterburner Chili JUDGE ONE Smoky with a hint of pork Slight Jalapeno tang JUDGE TWO Exciting BBQ flavor needs more peppers to be taken seriously FRANK Keep this out of reach of children Im not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain I had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver They had to walkietalkie in extra beers when they saw the look on my face Chili Freds Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili JUDGE ONE Excellent firehouse chili Great kick Needs more beans JUDGE TWO A beanless chili a bit salty good use of red peppers FRANK Call the EPA Ive located a uranium spill My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano Everyone knows the routine by now Barmaid pounded me on the back now my backbone is in the front part of my chest m getting shitfaced Chili Bubbas Black Magic JUDGE ONE Black bean chili with almost no spice Disappointing JUDGE TWO Hint of lime in the black beans Good side dish for fish or other mild foods not much of a chili FRANK I felt something scraping across my tongue but was unable to taste it Sally the bar maid was standing behind me with fresh refills that lb bitch is starting to look HOT just like this nuclearwaste Im eating Chili Lindas Legal Lip Remover JUDGE ONE Meaty strong chili Cayenne peppers freshly ground adding considerable kick Very impressive JUDGE TWO Chili using shredded beef could use more tomato Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement FRANK My ears are ringing and I can no longer focus my eyes I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming Screw those rednecks Chili Veras Very Vegetarian Variety JUDGE ONE Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili Good balance of spice and peppers JUDGE TWO The best yet Aggressive use of peppers onions and garlic Superb FRANK My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous sulfuric flames No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone Chili Susans Screaming Sensation Chili JUDGE ONE A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers JUDGE TWO Ho Hum tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment I should note that I am worried about Judge Number He appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably FRANK You could put a grenade in my mouth pull the pin and I wouldnt feel a damn thing Ive lost the sight in one eye and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water My shirt is covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth My pants are full of lavalike shit to match my damn shirt At least during the autopsy theyll know what killed me Ive decided to stop breathing its too painful Screw it Im not getting any oxygen anyway If I need air Ill just suck it in through the inch hole in my stomach Chili Helens Mount Saint Chili JUDGE ONE A perfect ending this is a nice blend chili safe for all not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence JUDGE TWO This final entry is a good balanced chili neither mild nor hot Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge Number passed out fell and pulled the chili

where there any other documents received from Centana Original Message From Proctor Shemin V ENRON Sent Wednesday February AM To Nemec Gerald Subject RE FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Hi Gerald Yesterday you gave me the gas transportation contract between CIPCO and ENA Do you have a copy of the firm gas storage agreement between the parties My no is Thanks Shemin Original Message From Nemec Gerald mailtoGerald NRONcom Sent Tuesday February PM To Proctor Shemin V Mann Kay Cc Subject FW FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Kay Mark is aware of this transaction The following is his response to Centanas counsel email I did discuss with Mark this morning the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas inplace to Centana and they would net out postpetition fees Our business people feel that we have used the storage services postpetition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense An amount equivalent to the prepetition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the prepetition amounts All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America Original Message From Mark Ellenberg ENRON Sent Friday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Mann Kay Subject Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services He is wrong on just about every point In the few instances where he has stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as of the petition date refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a violation of the automatic stay in this regard it should be noted that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the counterparty here the unstated premise of centanas position is that centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron this is wrong centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return obligation is not a debt this is clearly established in the cotton warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for section d on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential real property a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine whether to assume or reject executory contracts in addition the court has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief from the stay or adequate protection centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the estate this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages we should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards email in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to comply with enrons withdrawal requests this exposes them to breach of contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage charges based on storage actually used since december you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying postpetition administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a third party via inground transfer maybe that would work here Nemec Gerald To GeraldNemec cc ENRONcom Subject FW Gas Storage Office Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services PM Mark Attached is the authority under which Centana is holding portions of our gas in storage I will forward a copy of the storage agreement also Original Message From Michael S Richards ENRON Sent Wednesday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Greg A Swidensky Subject Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Importance High Gerald this email will serve as a followup to our telephone conversation from the other day There are a number of arguments we believe we have with respect to our entitlement to prebankruptcy lease payments under our storage lease with Enron These arguments include our rights under our storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment rejectionassumption and adequate protection issues These issues are briefly addressed below Under the terms of our September Gas Storage Agreement Enron is obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of for past due lease obligations Currently Enron is past due for both pre and postbankruptcy lease obligations to us Under the terms of the lease we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due obligations including interest are paid We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law recoupment andor setoff rights We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage lease If Enron rejects our year lease we calculate the rejection damages for anticipatory breach to exceed million which is in excess of the value of the gas Recoupment rights are generally available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party against another with respect to a single indivisible contract If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to offset our claims under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the automatic stay because mutual debts may be offset against each other to achieve a just result Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group Frd nd Cir Section d of the Code requires that a debtorinpossession timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until it is assumed or rejected Therefore not only rent but also other fees taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the lease must be paid under Section d Courts have held late charges for postpetition prerejection lease payments to be obligations that must be paid as administrative expense claims See eg In re MS Freight Distribution Inc BR Bankr WD Wash We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject this contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we believe we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the exercise of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold the gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights See eg Citizens Bank v Strumpf US Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this gas with a credit against the purchase price for both pre and post bankruptcy lease obligations We believe we should seek bankruptcy court approval to the extent this involves prebankruptcy obligations This
