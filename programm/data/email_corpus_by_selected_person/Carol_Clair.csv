NRON Sent by Enron NRON PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American European including Japan and Australia Global Markets and Industrial Markets operations and will be expanded to include Enrons Net Works business u nit as well as a new unit Enron Global Assets In addition Enrons me rchant businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below Mark Frevert currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units will assum e the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services Greg Whalley currently

region Sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region will report to Sanjay In this role Sanjay will report to the EBS office of the Chairman In addition Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for Enrons wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi ness into Enron Global Assets in the near future Diomedes Christodoulou currently CoCEO of Enron South America has joined EBS as Chief Commercial Officer Diomedes will be located in London and wi ll focus his origination activities on global opportunities with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors Diomedes will report to the EBS Office of the Chairman Jim Bannantine currently CoCEO of Enron South America will be joining EE S to lead EES commercial efforts outside North America and Europe In or der to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities Jim will remain in South America for at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout h America Throughout the transition Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services Following the transition Jim will join EES In addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities we are making the following changes in

Industrial Markets organization under the leadership of Jeff McM ahon President CEO and Ray Bowen Chief Operating Officer remains unchanged Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with and be managed b y the individual business units We are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of EWS and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more

These newly defined roles are as follows Mid and Back Office Operations Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic e Operations across EWS These services will become part of Enron Net Works with Sally

Carol,Clair,<8948404.1075842196144.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,carol.clair@enron.com,2001-05-30 09:21:00,RE Encore Issues List Cc Thanks for your prompt response I can respond to some of your comments In point I was referring to your change in Part b which changed Section avi from cross default to cross acceleration From a credit standpoint we prefer a cross default trigger I will check with Ed on point With respect to points and because of the difficulty in perfecting an interest in cash collateral in Canada based on advice from our Canadian counsel as well as Stikemans ISDA opinion on this issue we do not accept cash collateral from Canadian counterparties With respect to surety bonds there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance For this reason we do not accept surety bonds as collateral With respect to point the answer is yes All of the other points need to be discussed Can we now schedule a call for later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues Please let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach I am not in the office on Mondays I look forward to hearing from you Carol St Clair EB Phone Fax Keith Ferguson PM To cc Michael Roach Email Paul McMillan Email Subject RE Encore Issues List Carol thanks for your list I have inserted some commentsresponses on a preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your email Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May AM To Cc Subject Encore Issues List Keith As we discussed here is Enrons legalcredit issues list on the ISDA We cannot agree to crossacceleration KF I assume you are referring to Default under Specified Transaction Encores view and the view of a majority of its counterparties is that where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions outstanding a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently significant that it should trigger a default under the other There may be reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate and we would appreciate your comments There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed Enrons million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements KF In the transactions documented in NovemberDecember of last year the million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation to Enron Corp and a million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities Inc Im not sure why the reduction to million for Epcor was suggested More importantly I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing an alternative which would be a percentage of net tangible assets and that Mr Sacks was going to give that some thought We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy KF Our concern is that creates a risk for the noninsolvent party in relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic termination clauses in their agreements The shortform agreements signed in late appear to accept automatic termination We prefer the Loss method KF Are you opposed to the nondefaulting party having the choice between Loss and Market Quotation We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the materially weaker standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex We believe that Business Days is too long for posting an LC KF I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach With respect to the second point we are advised by Epcors treasury group that the time frame is necessary and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as Eligible Collateral if the time frame is required to produce an LC we would envision putting up cash within say a two Business Day period and substituting an LC when it is issued We would like to make the GP of Encore a Specified Entity We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of Specified Transaction to include physical transactions KF I assume this is related to your first point In the MAC Additional Termination Event we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral KF Agreed I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other party acting reasonably We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section b KF If Alberta law is to apply we thought Alberta courts should have jurisdiction I understand that both parties have offices and conduct business in Alberta We need to discuss the arbitration language KF For background this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent with the approach taken in the prior agreements We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate KF Again this was done to Canadianize the agreement References to US rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didnt seem appropriate Why do you want to exclude Sections trough of the Commodity Definitions Supplement KF I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule In the Recording section we would like to add the phrase To the extent permitted by applicable law at the beginning of the last sentence KF Agreed We cannot agree to No Fault Termination KF This is a significant issue In the event of a fixed for floating price swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price my understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault Termination is the better approach We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations Looks like LCs would be the only form of acceptable collateral KF Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue He also advised that Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns about perfecting a security interest in cash Can you outline the concerns We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts KF I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs Sacks and Roach I also understand Mr Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning what he perceives to be the political risk in the Alberta marketplace and that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are addressed Can you confirm We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer KF I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in part involves understanding which banks are involved If the Epcor information has not been provided please let me know and I will arrange to have it passed on I look forward to hearing from you Carol St Clair EB Phone Fax Regards

Clair EB Phone Fax Forwarded by Carol St ClairHOUECT on PM Mark PowellCALECT Sent by Mark Powell PM To Carol St CT cc Peter CT Greg CT Subject Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA Hi Carol Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited WCL in order to replace the existing securities representations as found near the bottom o f this email in the ISDA to It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission Rule OvertheCounter Derivatives From my perspective there are four main reasons why this amendment would n ot be appropriate They are as follows Proposed Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives and the corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted At this time is merely a proposal In addition to checking the Ontario Securities Commission OSC website I have contacted the lawyer who firs t brought the securities representation issue to our attention and he has confirmed that is not yet in place and there have been no recent announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such adoption Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto any trade with Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada is likely to be considered a trad e within Alberta under Alberta securities law due to the fact that the head office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta As a result it is important that we get representations which address Alberta securities law In a similar vein to point number above a trade can take place in a number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade Although it may seem unlikely it is possible that trades could possibly be made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario With the exception o f British Columbia I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting similar blanket orders policies or rules with respect to this issue However it is usually Ontario Alberta and British Columbia which are at t he forefront of Canadian securities law development with the remaining jurisdictions eventually following the leaders I expect that once is in place we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions Regardless it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi a in place at this time I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th e fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an OTC Derivative and thus have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions potentially available to them I can think of no reason why it would be beneficial to either party to remove this representation With respect to our physical agreements we have addressed points and above as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are provided by blanket orders and policies as opposed to the Securities Act Alberta Securities Act British Columbia or Securities Act Ontario a nd are thus more likely to be and more easily amended with the following clause i each Transaction shall constitute a commodity contract or an OTC derivative or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi ties legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction and ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc and paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR in either case as amended restated replaced or reenacted fr om time to time and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta British Columbia or any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to the openended nature of the abovementioned clause If we want to refer to and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place I would suggest that we amend the existing clause which states Canadian Securities Acts i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC Derivative as defined in the Securities Act Alberta and the Securitie s Act British Columbia which have application to such Transaction and ii it i s a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Se curities Commission Order Doc andor paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC as in effect on the dat e hereof to Canadian Securities Legislation i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC derivative within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc ASC paragraph of British Columb ia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC BCSC andor paragraph of proposed Ontario Securities Commission Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives as published by the Ontario Securities Commission on January Proposed OSC as applicable to such Transaction ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of ASC andor paragraph of BCSC as in effe ct on the date hereof and iii it is a qualified party within the meaning of paragraph of Proposed OSC Once is formally adopted by the OSC the bold and square bracketed language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which were drafted using such language Similarly if there are amendments to t he Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province other than Ontario Alber ta or British Columbia which could possibly haveclaim some jurisdiction with respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy y ou may want to amend the clause and possibly the preexisting ISDAs I hope this discussion is useful for you If you have any questions pleas e do not hesitate to give me a call I can

NRON Sent by Enron NRON PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American European including Japan and Australia Global Markets and Industrial Markets operations and will be expanded to include Enrons Net Works business u nit as well as a new unit Enron Global Assets In addition Enrons me rchant businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below Mark Frevert currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units will assum e the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services Greg Whalley currently

region Sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region will report to Sanjay In this role Sanjay will report to the EBS office of the Chairman In addition Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for Enrons wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi ness into Enron Global Assets in the near future Diomedes Christodoulou currently CoCEO of Enron South America has joined EBS as Chief Commercial Officer Diomedes will be located in London and wi ll focus his origination activities on global opportunities with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors Diomedes will report to the EBS Office of the Chairman Jim Bannantine currently CoCEO of Enron South America will be joining EE S to lead EES commercial efforts outside North America and Europe In or der to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities Jim will remain in South America for at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout h America Throughout the transition Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services Following the transition Jim will join EES In addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions Enron Net Works Louise Kitchen will assume Gregs previous responsibilities as President and CEO of Enron Net Works reporting into

Industrial Markets organization under the leadership of Jeff McM ahon President CEO and Ray Bowen Chief Operating Officer remains unchanged Commercial Support for EWS The commercial support functions

These newly defined roles are as follows Mid and Back Office Operations Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic e Operations across EWS These services will become part of Enron Net Works with Sally

point I was referring to your change in Part b which changed Section avi from cross default to cross acceleration From a credit standpoint we prefer a cross default trigger I will check with Ed on point With respect to points and because of the difficulty in perfecting an interest in cash collateral in Canada based on advice from our Canadian counsel as well as Stikemans ISDA opinion on this issue we do not accept cash collateral from Canadian counterparties With respect to surety bonds there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance For this reason we do not accept surety bonds as collateral With respect to point the answer is yes All of the other points need to be discussed Can we now schedule a call for later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues Please let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach I am not in the office on Mondays I look forward to hearing from you Carol St Clair EB Phone Fax Keith Ferguson PM To cc Michael Roach Email Paul McMillan Email Subject RE Encore Issues List Carol thanks for your list I have inserted some commentsresponses on a preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your email Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May AM To Cc Subject Encore Issues List Keith As we discussed here is Enrons legalcredit issues list on the ISDA We cannot agree to crossacceleration KF I assume you are referring to Default under Specified Transaction Encores view and the view of a majority of its counterparties is that where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions outstanding a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently significant that it should trigger a default under the other There may be reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate and we would appreciate your comments There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed Enrons million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements KF In the transactions documented in NovemberDecember of last year the million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation to Enron Corp and a million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities Inc Im not sure why the reduction to million for Epcor was suggested More importantly I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing an alternative which would be a percentage of net tangible assets and that Mr Sacks was going to give that some thought We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy KF Our concern is that creates a risk for the noninsolvent party in relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic termination clauses in their agreements The shortform agreements signed in late appear to accept automatic termination We prefer the Loss method KF Are you opposed to the nondefaulting party having the choice between Loss and Market Quotation We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the materially weaker standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex We believe that Business Days is too long for posting an LC KF I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach With respect to the second point we are advised by Epcors treasury group that the time frame is necessary and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as Eligible Collateral if the time frame is required to produce an LC we would envision putting up cash within say a two Business Day period and substituting an LC when it is issued We would like to make the GP of Encore a Specified Entity We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of Specified Transaction to include physical transactions KF I assume this is related to your first point In the MAC Additional Termination Event we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral KF Agreed I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other party acting reasonably We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section b KF If Alberta law is to apply we thought Alberta courts should have jurisdiction I understand that both parties have offices and conduct business in Alberta We need to discuss the arbitration language KF For background this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent with the approach taken in the prior agreements We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate KF Again this was done to Canadianize the agreement References to US rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didnt seem appropriate Why do you want to exclude Sections trough of the Commodity Definitions Supplement KF I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule In the Recording section we would like to add the phrase To the extent permitted by applicable law at the beginning of the last sentence KF Agreed We cannot agree to No Fault Termination KF This is a significant issue In the event of a fixed for floating price swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price my understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault Termination is the better approach We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations Looks like LCs would be the only form of acceptable collateral KF Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue He also advised that Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns about perfecting a security interest in cash Can you outline the concerns We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts KF I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs Sacks and Roach I also understand Mr Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning what he perceives to be the political risk in the Alberta marketplace and that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are addressed Can you confirm We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer KF I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in part involves understanding which banks are involved If the Epcor information has not been provided please let me know and I will arrange to have it passed on I look forward to hearing from you Carol St Clair EB Phone Fax Regards

St Clair EB Phone Fax Forwarded by Carol St ClairHOUECT on PM Mark PowellCALECT Sent by Mark Powell PM To Carol St CT cc Peter CT Greg CT Subject Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA Hi Carol Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited WCL in order to replace the existing securities representations as found near the bottom o f this email in the ISDA to It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission Rule OvertheCounter Derivatives From my perspective there are four main reasons why this amendment would n ot be appropriate They are as follows Proposed Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives and the corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted At this time is merely a proposal In addition to checking the Ontario Securities Commission OSC website I have contacted the lawyer who firs t brought the securities representation issue to our attention and he has confirmed that is not yet in place and there have been no recent announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such adoption Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto any trade with Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada is likely to be considered a trad e within Alberta under Alberta securities law due to the fact that the head office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta As a result it is important that we get representations which address Alberta securities law In a similar vein to point number above a trade can take place in a number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade Although it may seem unlikely it is possible that trades could possibly be made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario With the exception o f British Columbia I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting similar blanket orders policies or rules with respect to this issue However it is usually Ontario Alberta and British Columbia which are at t he forefront of Canadian securities law development with the remaining jurisdictions eventually following the leaders I expect that once is in place we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions Regardless it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi a in place at this time I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th e fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an OTC Derivative and thus have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions potentially available to them I can think of no reason why it would be beneficial to either party to remove this representation With respect to our physical agreements we have addressed points and above as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are provided by blanket orders and policies as opposed to the Securities Act Alberta Securities Act British Columbia or Securities Act Ontario a nd are thus more likely to be and more easily amended with the following clause i each Transaction shall constitute a commodity contract or an OTC derivative or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi ties legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction and ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc and paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR in either case as amended restated replaced or reenacted fr om time to time and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta British Columbia or any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to the openended nature of the abovementioned clause If we want to refer to and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place I would suggest that we amend the existing clause which states Canadian Securities Acts i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC Derivative as defined in the Securities Act Alberta and the Securitie s Act British Columbia which have application to such Transaction and ii it i s a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Se curities Commission Order Doc andor paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC as in effect on the dat e hereof to Canadian Securities Legislation i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC derivative within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc ASC paragraph of British Columb ia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC BCSC andor paragraph of proposed Ontario Securities Commission Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives as published by the Ontario Securities Commission on January Proposed OSC as applicable to such Transaction ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of ASC andor paragraph of BCSC as in effe ct on the date hereof and iii it is a qualified party within the meaning of paragraph of Proposed OSC Once is formally adopted by the OSC the bold and square bracketed language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which were drafted using such language Similarly if there are amendments to t he Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province other than Ontario Alber ta or British Columbia which could possibly haveclaim some jurisdiction with respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy y ou may want to amend the clause and possibly the preexisting ISDAs I hope this discussion is useful for you If you have any questions pleas e do not hesitate to give me a call I can
