have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consume r market Enron Direct This effort in itself is impressive especially given that at the same time EES has had to significantly restructure and r etool its execution capabilities systems and mid and back offices I can assure you that these processes systems and capabilities are improving This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES EES risk and Enron Networks In that light I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European

effective January EESI was approved by the NEPOO L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January meeting On e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po licy for NEPOOL Members EESI Enron Energy Marketing Corp and Enron Powe r Marketing Inc are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bonds rather than corporate guaranty due to Enrons disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL EESI via Firemans Fund Insurance Company issued a Performance Bond in th e amount of in June the Performance Bond was reissued in J une in the amount of EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October addressed to Becky Pitre EESI Settlements and received by Becky probably October indicating that EESIs cu rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th e amount to to cover EESIs current activity level Becky d elivered the October th letter to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department Karen Cordova and informed Karen that EESI need ed to increase the Performance Bond to Karen requested Credit Department Nichole Gunter initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t o the level to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati on with Credit Department was October In telephone conversations with ISONE Enrons Credit Department personnel were informed by ISONE t hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r esolved within ten days of the date of the October letter Oc tober however the letter did not indicate such I was notified by Credit Department on October that the bond compa ny Enron utilizes for performance bonds would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin g invoices for other performance bonds bond renewals approximately The other performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI since June to various individuals ie Greg Sharp Mark Mueller J eff Golden Scott Mills and had still remained unpaid Payments for the other performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to which w as issued by the bond company on October executed by EESI on Octo ber and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISONE on October EESI was unable to comply with the October deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above Credit Department personnel informed ISONE pe rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October deadline but was wor king diligently to resolve the matter Credit Department personnel sent via FAX a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor mance Bond to ISONE personnel on October I notified Dan Allegretti Enron Government Affairs Chariman NEPOOL Par ticipants Committee of the entire situation prior to October Da n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems but to get t he matter resolved as quickly as possible Dan advised me that the implicat ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result
