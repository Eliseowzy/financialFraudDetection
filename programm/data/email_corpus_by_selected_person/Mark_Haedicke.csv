mentioned to you the marktomarket and accrual income exposure of million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB Mr Talwars view is that as long as the PPA is valid EFI has the right to collect the fee If however the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEBs claim then EFI would not be entitled to the fee I just want to point out that as DPC and Enron is working for a resolution EFIs role should also be considered And along those lines EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected Please call me at to discuss Tushar Original Message From Edison Andrew Sent Saturday September PM To Viverito John Leach Doug Dhruv Tushar Cc Aronowitz Alan Subject FW Fuel Management Agreement Gentlemen I think this email I received early Saturday morning directly and succinctly answers the questions we posed to Indian counsel Lets talk at your convenience Andy Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON Sent Sat AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement Dear Andy The answers to each of your questions is as follows There is no theory under Indian law that Enron could use to make an enforceable claim against MSEB in the context of the facts placed before us The concept of agency relationships does exist under Indian Contract Law The concept of third party beneficiary claims does not exist under Indian Contract Law However Enron cannot make use of the agency relationship theory as the Agreement has not apart from stating that DPC will be Enrons agent stated that DPC will be acting under the Agreement as agent for Enron for all purposes Yes our view is that Enron has no enforceable claim against MSEB on the basis of the facts placed before us and the provisions of the Agreement However if DPC makes a claim against MSEB and a judgment is awarded to DPC for recovery of the Fixed Fee either as such or by way of damage then Enron would have a right to attach the amount that may be payable by MSEB to DPC Kind regards Suresh Original Message From SMTP Sent Friday September PM To Cc Subject RE Fuel Management Agreement I am a little bit confused Is there any theory under Indian law we could use to make a claim against MSEB In America we might have a claim under an agency relationship or a third party beneficiary claim Is there any such creature under Indian law Is your advice that we have no claim whatsoever Original Message From suresh talwar ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESsureshtalwarCsureshEtalwarcrawfordbayleyEcomE NRONcom Sent Friday September AM To Edison Andrew Cc Subject Fuel Management Agreement Hello Andy I refer to your email of th September seeking clarification in respect of the advice we gave you on the th of September on the Fuel Management Agreement Agreement You wish to know whether Enron Fuels International Inc EnronFuel Manager could make a claim under Indian law against MSEB on any potential theories such as agency relationship third party beneficiary claims etc MSEB has to discharge certain functions under the Agreement These include amongst others approving of the Fuel Management Plan proposed by the Fuel Manager providing copies to the Fuel Manager of notices issued by MSEB to DPC pursuant to certain clauses in the PPA etc There is no provision in the Agreement to suggest that Enron has entered into the Agreement relying on the continued subsistence of the PPA and no commitment has been made by MSEB under the Agreement in that behalf Enrons right to the Fixed Fee from DPC under the Agreement is contingent upon DPC being paid the corresponding PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB I assume that the only parties to the PPA are DPC and MSEB The payment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee by MSEB to DPC is governed by the provisions of the PPA to which Enron is not a party Therefore there is no privity of contract between Enron and MSEBDPC as regards the PPA As a result Enron has no claim against MSEB for nonpayment of the PPA Fuel Management Fee to DPC and therefore has no claim against MSEB under the Agreement as there is no breach by MSEB of its functions under the Agreement I trust I have answered your query adequately Please feel free to call for any questions that you may have Kind regards

most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se rvices EWS manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights This is par ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com modity lines including gas power coal steel pulp and paper each of wh ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat ed entities to trade the various commodities Absent express contractual s etoff rights EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWSs credit position with counterparties with w hom we trade multiple commodities This setoff language which is set fort h below must be in all EWS trading form contracts Similarly when negoti ating on third party paper we should request that this additional setoff l anguage be added MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR EWS TRADING CONTRACTS A Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D ate the NonDefaulting Party X may at its option and in its discretio n setoff against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party Y by X or a ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreements ins truments or undertakings any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of Xs Affi liates under this Agreement or under any other agreements instruments or undertakings The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X andor Xs Affiliates X will give Y not ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff For purposes of this Section Owed shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable regardless o f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced as of the Early Term ination Date Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be conver ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t he rate of exchange at which X acting in a reasonable manner and in good f aith would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c onverted If an obligation is unascertained X may in good faith estimate t hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate subject to the releva nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained Nothi ng in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other securit y interest except as may be provided under applicable law This setoff pr ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff netting offset combination of accounts counterclaim lien or other righ t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled whether by operatio n of law contract or otherwise Each of the parties represent and acknow ledge that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions The parties further ackno wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip al and with respect to this Section as agent on behalf of its Affilia tes which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and oth erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section B Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre ement the NonDefaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default ing Party any amount under Section until the NonDefaulting Party receiv es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion which may include an opinion of its counsel that all other obligations of any kind w hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the NonDefaultin g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag reements instruments or undertakings which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du e and owing as of the Early Termination Date but does not include future p ayments between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates triangular se toff after the designation of an Early Termination Date This language ha s been reviewed by US bankruptcy counsel and is appropriate under US l aws for commodity transactions with USbased counterparties Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability In addition prior to introducing this language into your forms changes will be require d to terminology andor to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default eg Affected Party under ISDA Finally when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms please be aw are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term s monthly netting of receivables or the closeout netting procedures app licable upon the designation of an Event of Default both of which should remain in the trading forms Rather this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms When incorporating this setoff la nguage into your trading forms you will need to review the forms to determ ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi ll need to be overridden andor coordinated Finally in order to assist a ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties This explanation will be distribut ed shortly If you have any questions please contact me at or Elizabet h Sager at ,haedicke-m,Managing Director

Bellemare Vice President Utility Services US Electric Power of Point Lookout New York announced plans to construc t a megawatt MW coal fired power plant at Cherry Point in Whatcom Count y Washington Just last week Reliant Energy Seward LLC a subsidiary of Reliant Energy announced it is planning on constructing a MW circulati ng fluidized bed CFB cleancoal power plant in Indiana County Pennsylvania Analysis As the United States awakes from its energy policy slumber it i s becoming increasingly apparent that the days of near complete reliance on naturalgasfired generation to meet our growing energy needs is coming to an end According to EIA statistics natural gas prices have risen to histori c highs with January utility deliveries exceeding MMBtu compared to and prices which floated between and MMBtu Virtually overnight natural gas has gone from one of the least expensive generation fuels to one of the most expensive Since the January price spike prices have settled back down to the to MMBtu level for Henry Hub futures prices but even these prices would have been considered high just twelve months ago Coal by comparison is the United States most abundant fuel source constituting percent of our nations fossil energy reserves Coal price s have actually dropped for utility deliveries over the past several years according to EIA statistics In coal prices averaged shortto n MMbtu compared to shortton MMbtu for second quarter Although coal generation currently represents over percent of US generation production few plants have recently been built because of the environmental concerns associated with coal generation and the relatively l ow price for natural gas throughout the s In US coal production actually declined by percent which was primarily attributable to a larg e drop in coal exports coupled by smaller than usual growth in coal consumpti on for power generation But brighter days may lie ahead for the coal industry New socalled cleancoal technologies are being tested and developed In the s and s the pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor PFBC was developed removing sulfur SO pollutants and limiting the formation of nitrogen oxi de NOx pollutants inside the boiler The need for scrubbers or other postcombustion controls was eliminated by technology Texas New Mexico Power TNP constructed two MW lignitefired units that went operationa l in and based on the circulating fluidized bed CFB technology th at Reliant is proposing for its MW facility in Pennsylvania The TNP One power plant was however extremely costly to build Unit cost million kW and Unit cost million kW to construct Another technology being developed is the integrated gasificationcombined cycle IGCC technology that first converts coal into a combustible gas cleans the gas of virtually all pollutants then burns the gas in a turbine much like natural gas More than percent of sulfur nitrogen and particulate pollutants can be removed in the process Three gasification power plants have been built in Florida Indiana and Nevada In the early s PSI Energy and Destec teamed up to construct a MW IGCC generatin g unit at the Wabash River Project in Indiana for a total installation cost o f million kW In TECO completed the construction of its MW IGCC generating unit at Polk Power station in Florida for a total installation cost of million kW Japan has also experimented with cleancoal technologies In Hokkaid o Electric Power Co Inc started commercial operation of a MW PFBC power plant Test operations are being carried out at two other plants the MW unit of Chugoku Electric Power Co and the MW unit of Kyushu Electric Power Co Japan is also testing a pilot scale MW molten carbonate fuel cell MCFC at a Chubu Electric Power Co site It is interesting to note that these advanced technologies have historicall y approached the installation cost of a nuclear plant but have all the operational costs of a coal plant Now market conditions have changed and despite the high capital and operating costs cleancoal technologies can economically compete with naturalgasfired generation if gas prices continue to remain high Additionally expectations are that the next generation of cleancoal power plants will cost significantly less than the early pioneers cost The Department of Energy DOE for example assumes an IGGC power plant can be built for kW with an average heat rate of BtukWh in its Annual Energy Outlook report The DOE deserves a great deal of credit for bringing cleancoal technology to the point of commercialization In the cleancoal experiment began i n response to the USCanadian transboundary problem of acid rain In March of President Reagan agreed to a new billion publicprivate initiative to make cleancoal technologies a reality The program led to projects in states including cofunding demonstration projects such as the PSIDestec and TECO facilities In the mids the only options for reducing NOx pollution cost per ton todays low NOx burners have reduced this cost to under ton These low NOx burners have also reduc ed emission levels from parts per million ppm in the early s to ppm today Furthermore the Selective Catalytic Reduction SCR process reduces more than of the NOx contained in coal combustion gas The DOE reports that percent of all coalfired capacity in this country is now outfitted with lowNOx burners Similarly the cost for scrubbing technology which removes sulfur pollutants has been reduced percent since the s The improvement of power generation efficiency will be one of the most important technical issues for coal power plants because of its high carbon content The latest commercial plant has achieved a thermal efficiency of percent by increasing steam temperature and pressure Even with these improved efficiencies the coal power plant of the future may still be unab le to achieve the substantial greenhouse gas reductions that could be necessar y to address global climate change concerns There are other existing environmental regulations that may also limit the adoption of new coal generation The SIP Call rule requires Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce NOx emission by a specified amount by May with muc h of the reductions expected to come from coalfired power plants In the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone were adopted with an anticipated compliance cost for full attainment estimated at billion per year particulate and billion per year ozone respectively The Supreme Court is reviewing these EPA rules and recently supported the EPAs right to regulate these emissions see IssueAlert at wwwConsultRCIcom These rules are significant since they will lead to additional NOx and SO emission reductions the two precursors to fine airborne particles Mercury reductions are also being contemplated In November the EPA filed lawsuits against seven utility companies for Clean Air Act violations In a settlement with TECO TECO agreed to cut NO x and SO emissions by percent by and pay a million civil penalty But in the end the nation will likely turn to coal to help meet its growin g energy demands Great strides have been made to reduce the environmental impact of this abundant fuel source Since the use of coal has more than doubled while emissions of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants have decline d by percent and percent respectively If we can continue to achieve even greater emission reductions coal may well help provide the energy bridge to the future An archive list

announcement on Thursday John To be sent to All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom Coal LNG Weather Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enrons traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron The EquityFXInterest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business These employees remain in Enron Credit a part of Enron Europe EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by JanErland Bekeng will continue to

provide support for Global Markets EBS Industrial Markets We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise

nronXgate PM To Mark E CT cc Subject Davis reaffirms that he cant be trusted Mark This article confirms your skepticism about the CDWR deal Davis is already planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed earlier this year The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor its agreements Look at Daviss spin on breaching contract provisions State negotiators worried little about the confidentiality clauses in their haste to sign the contracts but now administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in longterm contracts From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking longterm contracts once prices go down in a year or two We didnt think a lot about the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the lights on But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment clause On another note thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday I am thrilled to be working for Enron Meeting with you Jim Derrick and others in the legal department reinforced my decision to join your company I am excited about our prospects for the future and will work hard to continue to add value and keep your confidence Best regards Steve Davis to divulge details of costly energy buys By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO Amid mounting attacks on Gov Gray Davis energycrisis secrecy administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin revealing full details of the states costly lastminute power purchases aimed at thwarting blackouts The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it will start disclosing information on the initial multimilliondollar purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January In doing so the administration will begin honoring Davis promise to reveal the details after a period of six months or less The governor said disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down power costs But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from opengovernment advocates consumer activists Republican lawmakers and others GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits under the states Public Records Act seeking disclosure of details on about billion in emergency shortterm purchases and additional billions on less costly yearslong contracts A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the lawsuits today in San Diego On Thursday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on Californians to phone the governors office in protest The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is getting it said Harvey Rosenfield the groups director The governor wont let us look at them contracts to make sure they wont cause further rate hikes in future years Rosenfield said It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts he said We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions Administration officials dismissed critics assertions and said that full disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive marketing matter Officials acknowledged for the first time however that some of the states less costly longterm power contracts with generators contain secrecy clauses that may prevent public disclosure The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less expensive longterm power supplies that authorities worried little about the clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have the suppliers permission to divulge them Though violating the agreement could void the contracts industry representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts Suppliers might however sign no more contracts with the state the representatives said Apparently there are some contracts with that secrecy clause and our legal people are looking at it said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio I dont know what the end result is going to be but its the governors intent to release the contracts While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in longterm contracts they said disclosure of the initial shortterm purchases will soon begin Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of shortterm spotmarket buys made in midJanuary within the next two weeks on the Internet easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis fellow Democratic statewide elected officials State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state power bills in February during a dramatic thhour reversal under pressure from the Davis administration The controller who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administrations handling of the energy crisis indefinitely postponed plans to put information from electricitypurchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a news conference to announce the disclosures In March Attorney General Bill Lockyer representing Davis in this instance provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases Lockyers letter said the publics interest in maintaining confidentiality in matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure But Lockyer a former East Bay politician said last week he personally favors making public the details of the purchases In my mind at least and as a matter of philosophy the expenditures are so extraordinary the issues are so important that the contracts need to be made public he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of Information Coalition Opengovernment advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of Californians believe they are getting too little information about how state officials are responding to the power shortage and a whopping percent want details of longterm power purchasing contracts made public Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the states Open Government Act said Kent Pollock the coalitions executive director The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that shield information from public scrutiny,haedicke-m,Managing Director

the financial services division Ive had limited conversation with him He is actively involved in corp development Howard Carter Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC He started his career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals He qualified as an accountant in and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in He joined MCC physical merchanting division when it was established in He talked to me about a control function that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enrons tasks for originators and structurers He seems to pick up several functions in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the loop for HR assessments David Tregar David is the Financial Director He was educated at Lancaster University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in He became an associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in and Fellow of the Institute in Since

Hes had various positions of responsibilities Prior to Enrons offer he was winding down his career by planning MGs relocation from One America Square to Cannon Street Now it looks like he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to G Bernard tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MGs business etc He has a solid understanding of the financial services division and an outstanding working knowledge of MGs office system infrastructure if he doesnt know something he knows where to get the answer I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long long time Michael Farmer Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and has over years experience in the metals industry He started his career with A Strauss Co a metal exchange broker and tin merchant He also worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head copper for Philipp Brothers He jointly set up MCC which is the physical merchanting division of MG with Dieter

with a lot of resources videos books brochures reports on the industry Hamish Scutt Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for years and developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part which led to him being recruited and hired years ago He is very interested in promoting a credit culture that proactively assigns limits and measures performance I get the sense that he has in

is known by a number of people Lee Munden Steve Young at Enron Tom McKeever Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the metals industry for over years He joined MG in when he became

Find Flaws In Commodities Overhaul Bill Capital Markets Report Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation Dow Jones Energy Service Philippines Relaxes Banks Requirement To Raise Capital The Wall Street Journal Europe Danger Signs The Economist Capital Markets Report US Regulators Find Flaws in Commodities Overhaul Bill By Dawn Kopecki WASHINGTON Dow Jones US financial regulators at a hearing Wednesday faulted legislation aiming at rewriting the nations commodities laws for going too far in some areas at streamlining the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets Some officials criticized the bill introduced by Rep Thomas Ewing RIll chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management for diminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission over certain derivatives products The legislation as well as a companion bill introduced by Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar RInd would streamline the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulate some aspects of that industry Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets The Commodity Exchange Act which expires Sept determines which agency the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has jurisdiction over what derivatives products A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines has slowed progress on the legislation Annette Nazareth director of the SECs division of market regulation faulted Ewings legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futures trading facility but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the securities traded on those new facilities The SEC does not believe that there is a justification for eliminating the traditional role of other regulators including the SEC in regulating markets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and other products Nazareth said in written testimony She noted that its especially important that the SEC retain its authority when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewer investor protections than exist today on futures exchanges Treasury assistant secretary Lewis Sachs also found that section of the bill flawed saying that his agency was concerned that Ewings bill makes regulatory oversight of clearinghouses optional not mandatory He was similarly concerned about giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over all transactions conducted within a clearinghouse The exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC may preclude securities regulators from maintaining oversight of organizations that clear securitiesrelated products Sachs said in his written testimony He added that regulation of clearinghouses should be mandatory and that the SEC should oversee clearinghouse transactions for products currently under its jurisdiction Nazareth also suggested that Ewing clarify a section of the bill so that it clearly gives the SEC direct access to audit trails coordinated market surveillance and inspection authority to pursue insider trading and other fraudulent practices regarding the trading of singlestock futures The SEC should not be required to seek the permission of any other entity to protect investors she said Both Sachs and Nazareth found it troublesome that Ewings bill has a lower threshold than other proposals for determining what constitutes a sophisticated investor Thats important because the legislation allows sophisticated investors to conduct a wide variety of transactions with the least amount of scrutiny from federal regulators We do not believe that adequate consideration has been given to whether million in total assets is a sufficient indication of sophistication she said Moreover the bill grants the CFTC broad discretion to declare anyone an eligible contract participant Lugars bill as well as a report released last year by the nations top financial regulators defines a sophisticated investors as having at least million in assets Sachs also had serious reservations about the way Ewings bill relieves regulatory burdens for futures markets saying that there may be some unintended consequences for legislating relief Once such provisions are written into law the regulators will have no ability to review and amend them should subsequent market developments warrant change or should other problems arise Sachs said In addition Sachs was troubled by some changes to the rules overseeing government securities that he said could undermine the laws that Congress put in place in recent years that were designed to uphold and strengthen the integrity of the government securities market Patrick Parkinson associate director of the division of research and statistics for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve also criticized a section of the bill that he said would leave uncertainty about whether some electronic trading systems for financial contracts between professional counterparties were subject to the Commodities Exchange Act C Robert Paul general counsel for the CFTC had concerns of his own about the legislation He highlighted problems with the way the bill handles metal and energy commodities as they relate to electronic trading systems For his part Ewing warned regulators that Congress may run out of time to pass the legislation this year if the agencies cant agree on key aspects of the bill I hesitate to say lets pass those parts we agree on Its pretty easy to pat yourself on the back and just do the easy work Ewing said Several lawmakers criticized the SEC and CFTC for holding up progress for the sake of politics The two agencies have deep differences of opinion over how to regulate singlestock futures Ewings bill gives the CFTC almost exclusive authority over singlestock futures The SEC wants to share jurisdiction over the new product I really dont necessarily see this as a turf battle Nazareth said following her testimony There are significant challenges in crafting a framework that protects investors in the way they have come to expect in the securities market Dow Jones Energy Service Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation By Mika Watanabe TOKYO Dow Jones Partial deregulation of Japans power industry in March hasnt exactly charged up the countrys power sector as industrial and commercial users have yet to take advantage of their newlywon freedom to pick suppliers However the launch of online electricity trading in Japan later this year will likely lure more independent power suppliers into the market spurring trading activity and possibly prompting the government to take further deregulation steps ahead of a scheduled review in March analysts say Among the early birds hoping to provide the catalyst for this process in the form of a trading system are Japanese trading house Itochu Corp JCIT or and the US Automated Power Exchange XAUP which plan to launch a Webbased electric power exchange in November USbased Enron Corp ENE has also launched its global EnronOnline Internet trading platform for a variety of commodities and financial products and is approaching companies here with the eventual target of trading electricity Even though the market will be limited initially if the trading mechanism were there a substantial number of largelot buyers who seek lower prices would participate while potential sellers who hold excess generation capacity would also join in to make money from their idle assets said Naoto Hashimoto a senior utility analyst at Nomura Securities As of March Japans odd highvolume industrial and commercial users which together represent of total Japanese power demand are now free to choose their suppliers The potential is enormous agreed Hideki Yokoyama general manager of Itochus power project group Though the performance of our online exchange wont necessarily be stellar at first its early launch should pave a smooth way to grab some of the Japanese electricity market which is slated to open in the next stage of deregulation within three years Yokoyama also noted a chickenandegg effect while trading activity would likely lead to faster deregulation specific liberalization measures would lead to more activity Online electricity trading might take hold in Japan sooner than expected if requirements discouraging potential entrants are eased in response to growing complaints from various industries he said Even after partial deregulation independent power producers who want to sell retail electricity are still fettered by several inflexible requirements For example companies must sign a oneyear or longer transmission grid leasing contract and a costly backup supply contract with existing utilities Yokoyama predicts that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry might relax such requirements before the review Potential entrants calls for online trading could set a wave of ecommerce in motion and that would put added pressure on the regulators he said Utilities Participation Key To Boosting Liquidity Experts concede that online electricity trading liquidity is likely to be thin in the initial stage but they say volume will snowball as domestic utility giants enter the market APX and Itochu plan to form a joint venture in July for their online exchange tentatively called JPX and expect Japanese utilities as well as other energy concerns to invest in the Ybillion venture We will keep the door open for any regional power monopolies said Yokoyama adding that some utilities are now studying the trading mechanism with keen interest Its just a matter of time before some farsighted existing utilities use the new mechanism to hedge against potential risks such as losing customers and falling prices and this will consequently increase market liquidity predicted Nomuras Hashimoto Outside the power concerns the likely participation of other domestic heavyweights including Osaka Gas Co JOSG or and Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp NTT or should also provide a tremendous boost to the electricity market said Masanori Maruo a Tokyobased utility analyst at Deutsche Securities Ltd NTT Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas Co JTYG or already unveiled in March their plan to team up in entering Japans retail electricity business Gas utilities and NTT hold massive excess power generation capacity while NTT is the countrys largest electricity user which alone represents of entire domestic consumption said Maruo The combination will be able to play a significant role in electricity trading by taking a twoway position to offset risks he said In addition some domestic and foreign financial firms including Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd JIBJ or and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co MWD are set to offer various electricitylinked derivatives designed to manage risks from fluctuations in demand and prices Such products could spur further market participation of existing utilities as well as potential sellers Analysts say the biggest longterm risks are those faced by utilities which lag behind in doing business the new way While market participation wont bring them much financial gain such power companies have the most compelling need to hedge against price fluctuations as they surrender their pricesetting monopolies to market forces It may seem that power utilities have little to gain from participating in online trading but in fact they have much to lose if they stay away from the trading mechanism as they fall behind in hedging risks said Hashimoto Eventually theyd end up playing a losers game The Wall Street Journal Europe Philippines Relaxes Banks Requirement To Raise Capital MANILA The Philippine Central Bank has decided to withdraw a requirement for banks to raise their minimum capital for a move expected to ease investors concerns over the stability of the countrys banking industry analysts said The decision to eliminate the third and final round of a capital increase for banks effectively extends to Dec the deadline for compliance with last years minimum capital requirement of billion pesos million euros for universal banks and billion pesos for commercial banks Originally universal banks were required to raise their minimum capital to billion pesos by the end of while commercial banks were required to raise their minimum capital to billion pesos In the Philippines universal banks are commercial banks with expanded licenses that allow them to venture into noncommercial banking operations such as investment banking and fund management The central banks decision to relax its capital rule will prevent a loss of confidence in banks that would otherwise have had a difficult time meeting the new requirement said Angping Associates Securities Inc The move will also prevent panic among depositors that could lead to heavy withdrawals at banks or the banks closure Angping added The central banks capital requirement for banks may be adjusted next year in line with the new riskbased capital framework contained in the recently passed General Banking Act The framework allows the central bank to impose new capital requirements based on the activities banks are involved in and the capital risks tied to them Higher capitalization may be imposed for instance on banks engaged in highrisk transactions such as derivatives trading central bank Gov Rafael Buenaventura said The central bank implemented a threestage increase of the minimum capital of banks in in a bid to strengthen the banking system to prevent a fallout from the Asian financial crisis Ironically however the higher capital requirements indirectly led to the closure of one commercial bank and heavy withdrawals at two other banks earlier this year Last month Urban Bank closed after experiencing a liquidity crunch after several days of withdrawals by depositors The withdrawals were triggered by rumors that the banks previous downgrade to a thrift bank from a commercial bank was because of cash flow problems The bank was downgraded because it couldnt meet the original billion peso capital requirement deadline for commercial banks as of the end of The Economist Danger Signs An unusual thing happened this week in America The prices of corporate bonds rose Of late they have proved a dreadful investmentworse by far than government bonds How much farther their prices will rise depends largely on what happens in the market in which they are priced the swaps market That market is in turmoil Swaps are the glue that binds together the worlds financial system First developed in the early s they now dwarf other financial instruments At the end of last year there were some trillion of swaps outstanding compared with trillion in for example international bond markets Broadly swaps come in two forms interestrate swaps and currency swaps Simply put both allow parties to exchange cashflows In a currency swap the two exchange currencies and reexchange them at maturity at the same rate In the meantime they exchange interest payments In a typical interestrate swap one side exchanges a floatingrate obligation generally based on Libor the rate at which the best banks lend to each other for a fixed one This simplicity has made swaps and interestrate swaps in particular a very useful tool They allow banks for example to match their assets and liabilities much more closely If they have lots of shortterm floatingrate liabilities such as savings accounts but longterm fixedrate assets such as loans they can swap longterm assets into shortterm ones Likewise companies can use swaps to convert fixedrate debt which investors might prefer into floatingrate debt or vice versa The level of the fixed rate in the swap reflects among other things the willingness of the market to accept corporate debt rather than government debt which means that the swap rate is calculated at a spread over government bonds Euro swapspreads have risen in recent weeks but dollar swapspreads have widened dramatically Tenyear spreads peaked at the end of May at basis points hundredths of a percentage pointa higher spread than ever before see chart on next page They have since narrowed but are still wider than at the height of the financial crisis that followed Russias default At times in recent weeks the swaps market has shut down completely nobody was willing to receive a fixed rate What on earth is going on There are broadly two sets of explanations one relatively benign the other emphatically not The benign view is that the rise in swap spreads is explicable by rising interest rates greater default risk and the relative sizes of governmentand corporatebond markets Governments are issuing fewer bonds On optimistic assumptions Americas government could buy back all its debt by American companies in contrast are borrowing hugely That makes government bonds more valuable compared with corporate debt It reflects what Stephen Compton head of bonds at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in Europe calls the privatisation of the bond markets Rising interest rates too are partly to blame for widening swap spreads When the market thinks that interest rates will rise there is more of an incentive to pay rather than receive a fixed rate That incentive is greater at times when as now longterm rates are lower than shortterm ones an inverted yield curve This means that anybody receiving a fixed longterm rate and paying a floating one loses money Then there is the increase in corporate debt Credit Suisse First Boston CSFB expects American companies to issue as many bonds this year as they did last when they sold record amounts Importantly for swap spreads one reason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares So American companies are becoming ever more highly geared and hence less creditworthy Share buybacks are running at double last years level and reckons David Goldman a strategist at CSFB will remain in vogue as long as debt is relatively cheap and firms managers think that more leverage is good for shareholder value If this were not enough swapmarket folk also point accusing fingers at Gary Gensler undersecretary at the American Treasury In March he said that federally sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which everybody assumed were guaranteed by the government were not The yield on their debt rose sharply Since they are the biggest actors in the swaps market so did swap spreads Swap knot Taken together these factors might seem enough to explain what has happened But James Bianco who runs an eponymous research firm thinks they are not Swap spreads he points out have been widening for the past three and a half yearsbefore any of these other factors cropped up And they do not explain why swap spreads have risen so fast this year Mr Bianco argues that two things dominate the pricing of interestrate swaps interest rates and credit concerns For most of the S swap rates went up and down with interest rates That relationship has now largely broken down suggests Mr Bianco because markets have become more concerned over risks to the financial system as a result of the crises of recent years If Mr Bianco is right this has important ramifications it suggests there are growing worries about the riskiness of the swaps market based on fears about the health of financial firmsby far the biggest participants Pshaw say critics there is no credit risk in the swaps market Forget about those telephonenumber figures no principal amount is exchanged in a swap so what matters is not the notional amount at risk but the cost of replacing the swapsa far lower number Moreover big banks post collateral if they are on the losing side of a swap thus eliminating even any residual risk Really Swaps are perceived as riskless That must be wrong says a treasurer at a big bank Unlike futures exchanges the swaps market looks only at current exposures not potential ones futures exchanges demand a dollop of cash up front to cover the second And the market has grown so much that these potential risks are becoming huge So it is at least plausible that people are starting to fret about the banking system But why might this be a problem in America of all places Because it is taking ever more risk to generate the returns demanded by shareholders Bank lending is growing by at an annual rate and property lending by its highest rate since If anything these rates are accelerating because after nine years of growth and few defaults banks backwardlooking risk models tell them that lending is a fine business And not just in America In Europe too banks are taking more risk to generate higher returns At best the swap market is merely reflecting this increase in risk At worst it might be signaling that the worlds financial system is in danger of becoming unglued End of ISDA Press Report Thursday June THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS

worked closely on the acquisition but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an online brokerage system like ETrade the press release on the launch of the system at the bottom of this message indicates that the site is an LME trading and execution system Ill forward over any other information I can find USA Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK June Reuters The worlds two largest metal exchanges said they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading system on Thursday The London Metal Exchange LME is carefully planning its introduction of electronic trading in the secondhalf of this year and refuses to be spooked by those urging action any action as long as it is now Jonathan Haslam LME director of corporate affairs told a conference in New York His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson president of the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX who said it would be very difficult for the new online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the success of the traditional exchanges Thompson told the Metal Bulletin ECommerce conference that said these elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk the clearing of trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments of the metals market which use the exchanges Haslam compared the LMEs trading turnover averaging billion a day with the around billion a day traded online by US energy giant Enron Corp Enrons expansion in the ecommerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas Pimpinelli senior vice president of MG London Inc part of UKbased metals trading group MG Plc In May MG agreed to a pence per share cash offer from Enron Pimpinelli said MGs own MITS online metals trading system launched in October has to date processed over contracts with an overall value of billion He told the meeting that between percent to percent of MGs order flow mostly from small metals clients was now done over the Internet Pimpinelli said the success of its Market Maker realtime trading facility within MITS for tonnages of up to a tonnes had encouraged the company to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called CTA Trader The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade larger volumes request a volume quote online and then have the facility to book the resulting live online quote Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the transaction to his individual or multiple preapproved clearing houses by way of a dropdown menu he said Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be launched in the next month or so Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli Karl Hackert head of ecommerce at US trader Koch Metals announced the impending launch of his companys own online metals trading system by the end of June Koch metals is a unit of Koch Industries Inc Hackert said the issue of the LMEs daily forward prices valuation at pm in London meant that the level of these quotes wasnt clear during the rest of the trading day Under the new Koch system prices will be updated every five seconds and out to months Koch are the first to do this offer near realtime forward prices and it is a big step forward in terms of market transparency he said Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME Making a generic mass system I dont think thats the business were in he said Steve Hays New York Commodity desk UK UPDATE MG to widen access to online metals trade By Andy Blamey Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON June Reuters UKbased metals trading group MG plc said on Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the battle for web preeminence comes to the boil MG one of the worlds leading metals traders said it would allow London Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system which had been restricted to clients with immediate effect The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system an MG spokesman said MG has so far signed up Category One ring dealing and Category Two associate broker clearing members of the LME We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new clients said Michael Hutchinson CEO of MGs Financial Services Division in a statement We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from other clearing members of the LME The wider access to MGs system need not necessarily pose a threat to other online marketplaces said Gavin Gross head of LME metals at brokerage Spectron Futures Ltd Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London Metal Exchange contracts later this month Theyre very different models MG is a principal in the market so youre looking at MG prices only Spectron is neutral were just providing a platform Its a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with each other Gross said The two can exist side by side he added Over percent of MGs clients are now using its online services the company said Market Maker turnover stood at contracts in May a growth rate of approximately percent per month since the launch in January of this year Online deals still make up a low proportion of MGs total trading turnover however MGs MITS system launched in October and has now processed over contracts with a dollar value in excess of billion and a monthly turnover in excess of billion We are using it MITS for the one or two lot small stop orders that you previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his trade said one user of an MG system at an ABCM However it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it will accept on MITS from its noncustomers he said Metals ecommerce sites are proliferating but they follow no single business model There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices intranets where big market players are cooperating different rules for access and a wide variation in revenue models the key to profitability The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture in which MG has a percent stake EMETRA is building a worldwide businesstobusiness BB ecommerce marketplace for the nonferrous metals markets including physical trading a futures and options contracts MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and Market Maker under a licence agreement

countries in currencies US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry Trading By Adam Aljewicz Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LONDON Dow Jones Enrons ENE offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring dealing firm MG PLC UMGA could bring the exchange one step closer to ending open outcry trading dealers say Both the USbased energy and communications group and MG have pioneered electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to onscreen trading The LME meanwhile is also seeking to introduce onscreen technology for outofring trading sessions Were not surprised in the least to see this tieup take place an analyst at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires Everything we see now is pointing toward the removal of the ringdealing sessions and its just a matter of time before it ends all together she said MGs chairman Tom McKeever said the company wont abandon its position as an LME ring dealing member but market watchers doubt whether after years open outcry can survive on the LME as fastpaced technological change sweeps through the industry Enron has made a GBP million cash offer for Londonbased MG in a bid to gain a foothold in the billionayear world metal market The US company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity markets and with its electronic trading platform Enron On Line it has already executed more than transactions valued at over billion since its launch in November Its not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals company because theyre both very big in industrial commodities said an analyst for a USbased commission house I think its almost inevitable that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past he said Enrons move into the metals market has also been linked to the LMEs growing interest in initiating an automated trading system and has lead some market watchers to suggest that the EnronMG tieup will lead to greater consolidation among LME members Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena Out of the ring dealing firms on the LME I think only six will be able to make the transition to onscreen trading said a dealer for a Londonbased bank And thats only because we have a banking background he said The six cited are MG the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia USbased brokerage Refco Inc Credit Lyonnais Rouse Barclays Capital and Fimat Metals The LMEs existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its circular trading floor Around of the LMEs trading takes place there but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry traders say Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring or go through the Internet said a dealer Thats how it will start and will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassed altogether MG which was spun off from Germanys Metallgesellschaft last September has pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in October of MITS and MARKET MAKER its Internet trading system MG is the secondlargest physical merchant of copper nickel and aluminum in Europe after Switzerlands Glencore When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more and more uncertain about their future MG is arguably the pick of the crop in terms of stability and profitably said a dealer for a North Americanowned ring dealing firm LME Considers Screen Trading Separately the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten the demise of open outcry trading It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screentrading system for use in out of ring trading sessions and that it plans to press ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of becoming a shareholder entity Weve made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to the LMEs governance said Jonathan Haslam director of corporate affairs at the LME The LME set up an eightmember committee in February which comprised four ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy for the implementation of new technology However it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be executed although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around companies with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the onscreen technology We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be he said But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks By Adam

growing rapidly according to a recent study by Anderson Consulting Just to of business in the nonferrous industry is currently conducted online while in three to five years it will be to he said Since the launch in October volumes on MGs internet systems known as MITS and MARKET MAKER have increased by a month and cumulatively exceed contracts now MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that currently offer online trading When we launched the system we had requests from many new customers to register We registered quite a few new customers It is beyond our expectations Mr McKeever added The increase in online business on MITS has been seen round the clock as customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system We were the first to start the

into this venture intending to put anyone out of business said chairman Thomas McKeever He added that the asyetunnamed new venture would attract new clients particularly small and mediumsized companies who regard conventional LME trade as too costly and complex He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players When you develop a global marketplace you attract presumably most industry participants he added Safeguard and Nasdaqlisted ICG which already has stakes in more than companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals plastics and cattle have invested a total of million in the venture taking and pc stakes respectively MG the worlds largest copper merchant will hold an initial pc with an option to increase that to pc within

customers It began live internet dealing of aluminium and copper in January MG expects MITS to be a hit CHRISTIAN KOHL American Metal Market Copyright Information Access Company All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Cahners Publishing Company DUSSELDORF Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader Metallgesellschaft Ltd launched its web site system that allows trade execution services on the Internet it is optimistic that the concept will be a hit Its been quite extraordinary said Alex Health MGs director of ecommerce systems Weve had something like reactions so far from both existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on He said that the noncustomers entering MGS site wwwmgltdcouk ranged from large groups MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that Heath said hed never heard of Of course its LME Week now so we are busy with socializing and making contacts there before we can reply to the requests weve received Heath said He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System MITS in time to display it at Brokers House by Tuesday evening MG Plcs recent floatation also provided a major motivation for the project to raise MGs profile he said Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes beyond the regular market activity but customers so far had used the facility for deals He added that MITS might soon contribute to MGs customer base but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be registered as regular customers At the beginning of LME Week few LME trading companies were prepared to comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading MGs presentations at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture Id be extremely disappointed if the idea didnt spread as the Internet will inevitably be a big factor in trading Heath said He noted that MG put itself under pressure by moving before some other company with a similar projectinthemaking could enter the scene Speed is a definite factor in the Internet and we can claim to be leading into the new millennium in this regard he said adding that MG received many flattering comments from brokers Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that certainly they got there before anybody else but added that they wont have very much of a lead time He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and that Barclays was making similar preparations but so far offered a web site order trading system only for nonmetallic futures He noted however that web site trading would not satisfy all requirements Its great for the small breadandbutter stuff but for longterm contracts its gonna be tricky isnt it Sellars said A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd another LME member questioned whether MG was really embracing technology or vice versa It could be a gimmick for customers and it doesnt really mean theyre successful with enlarging their customer base he said He noted that people were always interested in coming close but werent necessarily keen on taking the final step He said that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information They jumped the gun to a certain extent but well have to see if its successful or not European

chance Mark Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM Michael R Brown AM To Mark E CT Jeffrey T CT cc Subject URGENT IMPORTANT Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market FYI some interesting issues on the new exchange Michael Forwarded by Michael R BrownLONECT on Mark Elliott To Joe CT cc Michael R CT Steve W CT Fernley CT Richard CT Andrew CT Tim CT Diana CT Tina CT Michael CT Gregor CT Heribert CT Sandip CT Subject URGENT IMPORTANT Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market Joe Further to our discussion yesterday when you mentioned that you wished to commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday th August I set out below the main elements of legal risk as I see them in the various elements of the Exchange Rules You should note as a general matter that the Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the potential legal legal risk The Counterparty to our trades Enrons counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants with whom our bids and offers get matched our counterparty will not be the Exchange itself or a clearing house We shall only be told the identity of the counterpartyies with whom we have neen matched after that matching process has occurred There is no mechanism to filter counterparties based on credit quality types of counterparty etc Hence there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over whom they should do deals with Collateral Arrangements As far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the participants is concerned initial collateral of Euros is posted with the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods bank guarantee cashetc via ones clearing bank The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight on a variation margin basis if a counterparty is exposed over the level of collateral previously posted Note that the collateral which the Exchange may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered it appears that it will only cover the marktomarket value of deals struck on the Exchange which remain outstanding ie predelivery In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted it would appear that each trade will be calculated on a gross rather a net basis even for buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different counterparties The rules are very vague here I would suggest that your traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand by speaking to the Exchange if necessary exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral posting requirement Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants exposures and call for margin from the Participants clearing banks as appropriate there is an obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement It is unclear whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement I suggest that back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your trading staff Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not comply with the Rules more importantly from a good buisness practice perspective we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know these figures each day RAC and your traders should therefore check that we can do this immediately In the event that a counterparty defaults there are two points to note Firstly what constitutes a default is unclear The Rules state that a default is where a counterparty is to quote unable to meet its obligations under the Rules Strictly inability eg insolvency would not cover unwillingness eg counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay for whatever reason Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to meet obligations but of course point out that this would be for a judge ultimately to decide Secondly even if a counterparty is in default as defined there is no absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise call upon the collateral posted with it This will depend upon whether the management board of the EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so In my view the Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the individual participants as the Exchange is not the counterparty the Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of arbitration between the parties to a dispute Clearly this could be a number of weeks or months after the nonpayment dispute arose and hence increasing our credit risk Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral If the Exchange does realise the collateral however it will hold it for the benefit of all Participants Note however that this does not seem to cover previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above Taxes End consumers can be participants on the Exchange As this is the case if we get matched with an end consumer then apparently we open ourselves up to potential liability to pay German energy taxes Clifford Chance have advise me that whilst this remains an unresolved issue apparently the German fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that Germanbased entities pay such tax rather than foreignbased ones such as ECTRL which is our trading participant If you require further details on this please refer to Tina Ward in Tax Department Renewable Energy Sources Act Again if we as a seller were matched with an endconsumer then under this Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately of the energy sold from a renewable source I understand that this is approximately times as expensive as normal domestic power coming in at around pfennigs per kWh It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange although Cliffords view is that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism May be your traders should look into this in greater detail should it be of concern Settlement On a purely logistical level for your general information please note that physical power delivery is T whereas Buyer settles T The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers via the Exchnage It is unclear how the mechanics of this work they are not dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent I would suggest that your trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately by speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary It should also be borne in mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the T framework IMPORTANT NOTE Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a formal and final CACs process the rules have totally altered since we CACsd it last time three weeks ago However I understand that you would like to be able to trade from tomorrow which will be a few days in advance of the CACs process additional rules in German have only just been sent to me and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these In this respect please note that ECTRL is joining as a MarketMaker and hence under the Exchange Rules if you wish to proceed we would have the obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market opening hours The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of time for which bids offers are active minimum maximum volumes bid offerred the width of spreads etc I understand from Clifford Chance that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules What we do know at the moment is that if we fail too often to quote as a market maker then the exchange can remove suspend us as a trading participant In order to mitigate your risk at present therefore you may wish to consider the size of volumes we would quote and width of spreads etc and discuss with RAC and or Credit beforehand Finally I understand that a Dresdners banking terms for us have still not been agreed apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston Legal Department level and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are agreed and b I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could trade Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over a and I understand that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing arrangements Subject to clearing the items in a and b and discussing volumes spread etc with RAC Credit etc if you wish to proceed tomorrow please let me know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them of this our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would write to them when we wished our membership to go active Kind regards Mark,haedicke-m,Managing

Disaster Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM IssueAlert AM To cc Subject PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulat ion or Protecting Itself from Economic Disaster Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE customers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure temporary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and transfer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it continues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

Hood and McDonald The term cruelty as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague because it gives fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence and a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited or required In this case a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that hitting a year old girl more than once in the face severe enough to necessitate a hospital visit pulling her hair or pushing her into a wall causing her to become dizzy would fall within the purview of cruelty The family court order taki ng jurisdiction over the minor child was affirmed Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of defense motion for a lineup Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Cain eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendants untimely motion for a lineup An eyewitness testified that she was only an arms length away from defendant when she saw him key the complainants vehicle then enter a business The manager of the business notified of th e keying incident shortly after it occurred testified that defendant was the only person in the building lobby matching the perpetrators description Although eyewitness identification was a material issue a lineup would not have resolved any mistaken identification in this case The trial court also properly considered the untimeliness of the motion and the possible hardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness who resided in another state Defendants conviction of malicious destruction of proper ty over was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant was the carjacker Identification Witness credibility Whether the lineup was undu ly suggestive Sufficiency of evidence to convict of carjacking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Fordham eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan Since both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the man who stole the victims car and the trial court concluded that the victi m was not confused when he identified the defendant as the carjacker the tri al courts finding that defendant was one of the carjackers was not clearly erroneous There was sufficient evidence based on the identification eviden ce for a rational trier of fact to have concluded that defendant committed the carjacking Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficient evidence of intent to convict for arson of a dwelling house Whether defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the requisite intent Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Moss eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously regardless of whether he was intoxicated to some degree when he set fire to the victims home Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately hours afte r the fire his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o n the night of the fire The testimony indicated that even if defendant was intoxicated he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif ic intent The evidence established that defendant appeared at the victims home three times and was there purposely prior to the fire defendant h ad no reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims house defendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them and defendant followed through with the threats later that night when he purchased kerosene transported it to the victims home poured it onto the porch and into the mail slot and set fire to the home Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses attempted false pretenses and stealin g or retaining a financial transaction device Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Pitts eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan There was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false pretenses Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger door of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police the credit card numbe rs recovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card numbers given by defendants brother to purchase merchandise There was no evidence associating defendant with the representations that were made to t he employees by his brother regarding the validity of the credit card numbers Defendants convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempt ed false pretenses were reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Suppression of defendants inculpatory statements Whether interrogation was custodial Whether defendants statements were knowingly and voluntarily made Totality of the circumstances Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Rose eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court erred in suppressing defendants statements to police on th e basis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings from the outset of the interview Defendant agreed to speak with the police drove himself to the station and was informed prior to the interview that he was not under arrest and was free to leave At no time was he told that he was not free to leave and the door was left open The officers failure to tell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac t that defendant was told he was free to leave or render the interview a custodial one Further under the totality of the circumstances defendant s statements were knowingly and voluntarily made and were not the product of psychological coercion Defendant was years old had completed three yea rs of college and discerned the focus of the officers inquiries soon after t he interview began The trial courts order suppressing defendants statements was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Prosecutorial misconduct Other acts evidence Admission of witness testimony Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Vaughn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam OConnell Kelly and Whitbeck Although the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an accomplices plea agreement to bolster that witness testimony defendant d id not show that he was prejudiced The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc t by eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the witness to testify truthfully because the prosecutor did not personally vouch for the witness credibility Affirmed Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Modification of a custody order without conducting an evidentiary hearing Trial courts failure to identify the change of circumstances whether an established custodial environment existed or an analysis of the best interest factors Reassignment of custody matter to a different judge Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Belgiorno v Belgiorno eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Wilder Smolenski and Whitbeck The trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing before it entered an order modifying the parties custody The trial court s order placing physical custody of the parties minor child with plaintiffmother was vacated and remanded to conduct an evidentiary hearing state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record determine whether an established custodial environment existed determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed tha t justified a change of custody and address the best interest factors to determine the best interest of the child Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo baii ci g and j Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing Failure t o challenge one of the statutory grounds for termination Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Glover eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for termination of respondentmothers parental rights were established by clea r and convincing evidence Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment plan until approximately one month before the termination hearings Further while she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug testing she failed to do either Since respondent made no significant progress in these areas and considering her past history respondents parental rights were properly terminated under oo bci g and j Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Constitutional Law Issues Jurisdiction over the minor child Whether the term cruelty in o b is unconstitutionally vague Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Herronen eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The term cruelty as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague because it gives

pay support where there was an existing support order Appointme nt of counsel in a stepparent adoption Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Keller eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The termination of respondentfathers parental rights was reversed because the trial court erred by finding that o a was satisfied on the basis that respondent had the ability to pay child support and failed to do so I t was improper for the trial court to inquire into respondents ability to pa y child support under o a where there was an existing support order T he order that reserved the question of support because respondent was incarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th e ability to pay The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel fo r respondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding und er o a the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indige nt nonconsenting parent Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Standing Case or controversy Absence of an injuryinfact Challenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme Standard of review Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v Michigan Gaming Control Bd Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Barden Detroit Casino LLC v The City of Detroit eJournal Number Judges Nelson Moore and Wilhoit The district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs suit against both the ci ty and state defendants because plaintiff an unsuccessful bidder for a licens e to operate a Detroit casino lacked standing The court in Lac Vieux previously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred developers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tiebreaking preference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi no gambling in Detroit had been eliminated Since the preference was ineffective there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th e state defendants in regard to the state statute As to the city defendants the mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta ge of the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been eliminated from the competition Therefore the preference was never applie d to plaintiffs detriment and plaintiff suffered no actual injury Affirmed Full Text Opinion Malpractice Back to Quicklinks Issues Medical malpractice Statute of limitations Discovery rule Whethe r defendants failure to produce plaintiffs medical records excused timely filing of a presuit notice Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Cabell v Carino eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court properly granted defendantorthopedist summary disposition on the grounds that plaintiffs presuit notice was not filed within two years of the act or omission that was the basis of the claim While plaintiffs claim accrued in March he did not file a notice of intent to sue unti l June Plaintiffs assertion that he did not discover his claim until h e received his medical records from defendant in April was without merit Plaintiffs deposition testimony established that by June at the latest he was aware of a problem with his toe following defendants treatment for an ankle fracture and actually believed that the cast defendant placed on his ankle and foot had caused the problem Plaintiffs attorney was investigating his claim in October Plaintiffs claim tha t defendants failure to produce plaintiffs medical records in response to h is request excused the timely filing of the notice of intent also failed Affirmed Full Text Opinion Workers Compensation Back to Quicklinks Issues Claim for weekly wage loss benefits based on mental disability The Gardner formulation of the statutory test for determining whether an employ ee has suffered a compensable mental disability The Workers Compensation Appellate Commission WCAC Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name White v Department of Agric eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Owens Jansen and Burns The magistrate properly determined that although an incident where plaintiffs supervisor kicked him to wake plaintiff up after he nodded off on the job may have appeared objectively insignificant to the average person there was substantial evidence from plaintiffs physician establishing that because it would not take much of a stimulus to trigger a response in a patient with a preexisting borderline personality the kicking incident contributed to aggravated or accelerated plaintiffs mental condition in a significant manner All that is statutorily required are actual events of employment even if objectively unimportant that contribute to aggravate or accelerate a mental disability in a significant manner The decision of the WCAC reversing the magistrate and denying plaintiffs claim for weekly wage loss benefits on the basis of a mental disability was reversed and remanded the case for reinstatement of the magistrates award Full Text Opinion fields of practice

Enrons endorsement and adoption of the attached statement of principles on Security and Human Rights and my response is noted after each question Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its endorsement of these polices No If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy Given the limited physical presence of EGM in foreign locations I would not expect implementation to be a problem Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy The commitment under the Consultation and Advice section of the statement on Interactions between Companies and Public Security provides In their consultations with host governments Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote adherence to international law enforcement standards particularly those reflected in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms I believe we should take note that all appropriate measures is very broad and could publicly be construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular country that fails to abide by these principles My response pertains only to the operations of

been worked out over the past several months by a task force of the US and UK governments along with representatives of industry including Enron and NGOs including Amesty and Human Rights Watch under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and Foreign Secretary Cook As a result we really dont have the ability to change the text which is fixed As you know Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of their intrinsic value and their community relations impactsThese guidelines would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board adopted last year which really do not touch on security matters as such I have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these issues are of primary concern I am separately collecting commentsconcerns from within EES and EECC The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt of the Corp PR group Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and Pete Vandergam at Corp Security for their views of whether this can be implemented by Enron We as the legal department have been asked to express our view on are the following a Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its endorsement of these polices b If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy c Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials or have one of your lawyers do so You might need to consult with your operation personnel for their practical views as well I would be grateful if you could express any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November Wednesday so that I can coordinate comments and get the

David Redmond AM To Mark CT cc Paul CT Ted CT Peter CT Richard CT Subject Re issue wcompliance ertificate Mark I am not sure I follow this but I will attempt to present my interpretation of your note I am only restrained from trading those items in clause one if I am responsible for trading them at Enron and equities falls under securities in clause one Equities fall under clause one and are therefore not included in clause two Therefore since I do not trade equities for Enron I can trade them o n my personal account Brent Crude futures I would argue are financial instruments included i n clause one I am not responsible for trading them for Enron If they fall under clause one they are not included in clause two Does this mean since they are not in clause two and I do not trade them for Enron I can trade them on my personal account Perhaps you could give me a call Thank you Dave From Mark Taylor on CST To Cassandra NRON cc David CT Paul CT Peter CT Richard CT Subject Re issue wcompliance ertificate This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities interest rates and currencies The older versions of the policy provided th at no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyone other than Enron Beyond that no Enron employee could trade a commodity which was within their area of responsibility For example I was not permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but since intere st rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility I could trad e them As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more difficult to identify the scope of the companys concern much less to articulate it We did however take a stab at it and the result is below This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versio n of the Policy For now I would suggest that the term security highlighted below should be read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered i n the second numbered clause ie the word other refers to items other tha n those listed in clause i The result is that an Enron employee who does not trade financial instruments securities financial assets or liabilitie s for Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account To take this a step further one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of energy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his or her own account but could trade other equities if it were me I would certainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it Of course a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for personal trading metals ag commodities bandwidth freight lumber amon g many others for all employees As I remember it this was done purposely and if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise to discuss the matter with the RAC Group as they make suggestions for Policy revisions to the Enron Corp board

status Are we making changes suggested by our Mexican lawyers Mark Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM Weiland William PM To Haedicke Mark E cc Banczak Peggy J Dilg Joe Subject Choice of Mexican Law VitroMonterrey Project Peggy Banczak called me yesterday to say that the InterAmerican Development Bank IADB had indicated its refusal to fund its loan to the appropriate ENE borrower in connection with the EnronVitro Monterry Cogeneration Project Project unless the PPAs and construction contracts ie those contracts to be concluded between Mexican entities and calling for performance in Mexico be governed by Mexican law Peggy explained that after long negotiation ENE had been able to convince Vitro and Cementos Apasco and other power purchasersconstruction companies to agree that their contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this great success IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts be governed by Mexican law Peggy and I talked with Rogelio LopezVelarde and Peggy subsequently provided me copies of three memoranda dated August September and September addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell Patterson from Rogelio LopezVelarde and Amanada Valdez In the August memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez analyzed the enforceability of certain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial de Mexico S de RL de CV and Apasco should that agreement be governed by Mexican law They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement were to be governed by Mexican law In the September memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the Suspension Remedy contained in Section of the PPA In their memorandum of September they opined principally that the provision of Section of the PPA specifically denying each Capacity User the right to terminate the PPA except in the case of a Producer Event of Default under Section a sic has occurred and the Project has been Abandoned was unenforceable I have reviewed the three memoranda but I have not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limited review of the EnronVitro Amparo matter we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados memoranda and opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application of Mexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB now insists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability of provisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm however to be well reasoned and written As I have not seen the underlying documents I am not able to determine whether the August memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the Challengeable Clauses in the PPA in Section IA My guess is that the form from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used on other occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to be governed by laws of jurisdictions that have experience considering sophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputes specifically arising under power purchase agreements If ENE does agree to subject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexican law it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affected agreements to be absolutely sure that all of the Challengable Clauses are identified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make them enforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions as is are fully understood and evaluated by ENE I do have the following specific comments concerning the August memorandum If they already have not been made is it possible still to convince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados have suggested Based on the Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados memos it seems to me that ENE as a condition to agreeing to accept Mexican law as the governing law would want to negotiate at least the material changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm in the memoranda If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or is possible only to negotiate some of the changes with respect to the Discretionary Performance Prohibition and the Discretionary Condition Prohibition outlined in Sections I A and B would only the specifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be rendered unenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable if either performance of portions of the PPA as opposed to performance of the entire agreement are left to the unilateral discretion of one of the parties or compliance with some as opposed to all of the conditions rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions that individually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA If there are a number of Performance or Condition Prohibitions that are not amended could they in the aggregate be deemed sufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause in the PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to make enforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affected agreement Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary Condition Prohibitions constitute events of default even if the party in whose favor they run do not attempt to enforce them constitute an event of default that would afford the innocent party the right to demand rescission of the PPA I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain dispute resolution provisions that would subject disputes to international arbitration Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are not renegotiated the fact that Mexican law if agreed as the governing law will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor that could result in a more independent consideration and resolution of the interpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may arise under the contracts If you have questions or wish to discuss this matter please call me at William H Weiland CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE The information in this email

believe such tools would clearly add value immediately Mark Mark NRON PM To Rob nron Mark E CT cc Subject eLaw and eVelocity RobMark I wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of eLaw and eVelocity eLaw I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week The reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron to the tune of MM to MM The secondary focus was on the product and its usefulness to Enron Steve made it clear that any funding decision would be driven by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and thus it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go The demonstration of the tool was impressive Though it does act as a traditional shopping type site in many respects it also has functionality to create a myelaw page customized to the information you the user are the most interested in seeing It also allows for a query into further information which query is then forwarded to the law firms or firm supporting the practice area eg LaborEmployment for comment There is also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded organized and maintained including legal opinions memoranda on various topics and form pleadingsdocuments This area is secure from the balance of the site so that other users cannot access the information The loading process is fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment Some of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a new version coming out early Q and by the end of there is the plan to have at least or so practice areas available Right now the focus is on Environmental Intellectual Property Health Care and Tax I think the tool could be useful especially in relation to the organization of information we obtain from our outside sources It may also complement the websiteportal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the websiteportal development process I would be curious to see however what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function eVelocity I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs sp to discuss the eVelocity tool It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm and our legal department solely for the movement review and payment of law firm invoices While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a matter management system it can itself be used as a matter management tool The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of rules that are applicable to law firm invoices For example say Enron does not pay more than per page of copying This can be set as a rule so that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than this amount per page would be automatically rejected The rejection would then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to the system This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review but notes that it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney is alerted to the issue The system does identify the problem so you do not have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules It is possible to establish rules that would allow an invoice presuming it complied with all rules to be automatically approved and moved to AP for payment This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system but it could be done In addition to the above functionality the system can also track matters budgets for matters costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter Reports can be generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters Finally since it is a webbrowser based system implementation is not difficult and there is not a lot of IT involvement needed I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed and received the response that there really is no such need Mike indicated a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp portalwebsite it makes sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking Whether or not it is eVelocity or another comparable tool would require further research into the available products but I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere What I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings surrounding the demonstrations If either of you would like further information or have any questions please let me know Mark Senior Counsel ENA Phone Facsimile EMail ,haedicke-m,Managing Director

Citibank Mark Randy NRON AM To Sami nron Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob NRONDEVELOPMENT John nron Mark E CT Subject Re Elektros telecom project For what it is worth I agree with Samis concern that we may laboring under a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in a Brazilian contract between Brazilian contracting parties relating to a Brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a Brazilian court Inevitably we have to fight hard for these concessions in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration not to mention blood and sweat on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts If we are really being taken by these crafty Brazilian lawyers like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I think we should rethink the policy in this specific instance Elektro because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts we had a number of cases you will recall when we bought it and have had others since It is clearly not the only substantial highprofile Brazilian company Enron has down here making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as foreigners the way we do elsewhere By all means we should check with Jose Emilio but if he shares Samis and I have to say my concerns I think we should consider making a special rule for BraziltoBrazil contracting transactions Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo in English with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts federal if possible of Sao Paulo The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision thinking we are safe and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice due process etc If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions let me know Randy Sami Arap AM To Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Randy NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Elektros telecom project Thanks again Bob I will call Jos Emilio to check I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil whether international or local aspects are under discussion provided that you follow the exequatur procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago However the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with Article IIIIII of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code In such event if Enron please note that I am always only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in So Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and at the same time or at a later stage one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void I will be in Houston on Friday January and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls andor Jim Derrick Regards Sami Robert C NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Sami NRON cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT ENRON Randy Young Rob Walls Subject Re Elektros telecom project Sami I agree on the issue of Brazilian law But on the question of foreign arbitration our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec As to local arbitration we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than We should probably also have a cumulative cap of say million On bigger deals Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more is at stake is to agree to ICCadministered arbitration in Sao Paulo In this case I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award whether that be ad hoc ICC FIESP or CanadianBrazilian C of C Jose Emilio would have a view on this too Hope this is helpful Bob Sami NRON PM To Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re Elektros telecom project Michelle and Bob Thanks for the reply The issue here is when Brazilian entities only are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy and please correct me if I am wrong is that when Enron as a foreign company is dealing with foreign governments governmental agencies or governmentowned companies or private companies from the host company we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law In case of Elektro as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity EAS ECE etc entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil the contracting parties must comply with local public policy I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism we are all aware of Enrons policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in So Paulo To me the question is whether we use ad hoc arbitration OR institutional arbitration ie submit the matter to FIESP or the CanadianBrazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the arbitration administrator FYI since I joined Enron Ive been told that all of Enrons Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts dispute resolution mechanism In my opinion this concept may not work the way Enron wants If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and suppose both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY it is most likely that in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case You may ask why The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction Id very much like to emphasize that while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that at the end of the day I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts Since Odebrechts counterparties did not do their homework properly Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of The Civil Code of ractified the use of arbitration however it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts Only in with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act Law it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts With respect to enforceability please note that the arbitral award is final binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an exequatur Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter Rgds Sami

Mark Haedicke Maurits Schouten Robert Mark Steve Targett Teruo Tanaka Thomas Montag Tim Fredrickson cc Subject Board Matters I have spoken with a number of you regarding several Boardrelated matters and wanted to provide that information to everyone These relate to the following Nominating Committee Results Citigroup Board Meeting Schedule Strategic Planning Meeting Schedule PreStrategic Planning Lunches Nominating Committee Results The Nominating Committee has completed its deliberations and has recommended individuals for election at this years AGM to twoyear terms In addition to the reelection of Ernie Jerry Jose Manuel Keith Maurits Terry Tom and Tim the Nominating Committee has proposed the following individuals for election Kaushik Amin Managing Director at Lehman Brothers NY cohead of their global fixed income division Fred Janbon Global Head of Fixed Income at BNP Paribas London Azam Mistry Director Head of Risk Management AdvisorTreasury and Capital Markets HSBC Hong Kong and CoChair of our AsiaPacific Steering Committee Thank you to everyone on the nominating commitee for your efforts particularly those of you who had an opportunity to meet these and other prospective nominees Citigroup The Nominating Committee chose not to nominate anyone from Citigroup for election at this years AGM We have emphasized to Citigroup that this decision is due to a variety of factors including lack of attendance at Board meetings by current and past Board members and the fact that Citi has had a seat on the Board continuously since the Association was formed We have encouraged them to remain involved in ISDA activities with a view to rejoining the Board at the earliest possible juncture Please encourage your Citigroup counterparts to get involved or remain involved in the Associations activities Both Ravit and Thierry Sciard who contacted us to offer himself as an alternative for the position were upset by the decision but it is not clear what the longterm effects will be The most immediate tangible effect is that Citi has indicated that it is withdrawing its cosponsorship of the Tuesday and Wednesday evening events at the Washington AGM There is a possibility that Lehman may be interested in sponsorship Board Meeting Schedule Please make note of the Board meeting schedule for the remainder of the year April and over lunch each day at the AGM in Washington May in Kyoto more details below September in London November in New York note this is a change from prior schedules distributed Strategic Planning Session May and are the dates of our strategic planning session which this year will be at the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto The details on the Miyako Hotel are MIYAKO HOTEL Sanjo Keage Kyoto Japan Phone Fax httpwwwmiyakohotelcojp The schedule is slightly different from past sessions I will provide more details on the specifics but for your planning purposes you should arrange to be in Kyoto for lunch on Wednesday May Bullet trains from Tokyo that morning will get you there in time We will have dinner in the hotel Wednesday evening after our afternoon session On Thursday May we will start with breakfast and have a working lunch with the session ending around The afternoon will be spent visiting temples and perhaps going on a sake tasting tour Fortunately I do not believe that Francis Ford Coppola is a sake producer Dinner that evening will be at a restaurant and will be accompanied by a Geisha dance Please plan to stay for all of the events There is nothing planned for Friday so that everyone particularly the Europeans can get planes out of Osaka or Tokyo on Friday morning that will get them back for the weekend PreStrategic Planning Luncheons As in the past we will hold a series of luncheons in London New York and Tokyo where we will invite senior executives from member firms to share with us their thoughts on issues affecting the industry The tentative schedule and locations for these lunches is as follows Wednesday May London UBS hosted by Tim Frederickson Friday May New York AIG hosted by Ernie Patrikis Tuesday May Tokyo Royal Park Hotel hosted by Koshikawasan In addition to attending the luncheon closest to your office please consider arriving in Tokyo a day early to join us at the Tokyo session Again more details will follow In the meantime I would welcome any suggestions for individuals we should invite to these luncheons in the various centers I know this is a long email but it covers the critical dates for the coming months in one fell swoop I am on holiday the week of Feb and will be in Asia visiting Beijing Hong Kong and Tokyo the week of Feb I will be checking emails and voice mails Bob Bob,haedicke-m,Managing Director

I believe we need Blakes on a going forward basis in Canada Mark Haedicke Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM Peter Keohane PM To Mark E CT cc Subject Blakes Mark I understand that you and Jim D are meeting in Houston next week regarding Blakes their mismanagement of the NGX litigation and other matters I am providing you the following report so as the facts and issues are clear I am taking the time to send you this report because I am concerned that Dan Fournier has demonstrated to date that he either does not understand the facts and issues which is amazing or believes he can obfuscate and resolve the issues through political maneuvering You will recall that this matter kicked off late in Sept with NGX giving us two days notice that they were taking over control of the methodology for determining the prevalent gas indices effective Oct You will also recall that the matter was of significant concern to John Lavorato and Greg Whaley among others and following a conference call with John Greg Steve Kean Rick Shapiro and others it was agreed that we would consider our legal remedies including that I would prepare a draft stern letter to NGX advising them of our concerns and the potential for litigation with Enron both for internal review and review by outside counsel I discussed the facts and the letter with Blakes Dalton McGrath who advised me that he would also be discussing the matter with a competition law partner in Toronto In the end Blakes had some minor comments on the letter and provided a cover letter confirming that in the circumstances we had a difficult put provable case One issue raised by the letter was the potential involvement of NGXs shareholders for a number of reasons including i NGX had only two shareholders Westcoast Energy and OM Gruppen who to our knowledge controlled the mind and management of NGX ii OM Gruppen is in the business around the world of purchasing or creating electronic exchanges and had recently purchased its position in NGX from Westcoast Westcoast is the sole shareholder of Engage Energy a energy trading competitor iii NGXs transaction for acquiring control of the indices was an aggressive structured attack designed to cause harm to EOL and regain market share that EOL had taken away and iv NGX is a limited liability entity with little in hard assets and therefore may have been judgment proof Obviously if the evidence or commercialstrategic reasons warranted not proceeding against the shareholders at any time it was our intention not to continue to proceed against them In short Blakes was aware from the outset of our intention to involve Westcoast in any litigation As expected we did not receive a satisfactory response to our letter to NGX and between late Sept and Nov the date we filed the lawsuit and applied for injunctive relief I had countless further discussions with Blakes to draft and redraft and redraft again a Statement of Claim and Motion documents all of which clearly involved Westcoast as a named defendant Although the Court would not grant an injunction ex parte an aggressive timeline was established for filing affidavits and briefs completing crossexaminations etc with the injunction application set for Dec to our strategic advantage We were proceeding vigorously on this basis when to my surprise I received a phone call from Dan Fournier on Dec weeks into the matter to advise me that there was a legal conflict problem involving Westcoast who is occasionally represented out of Blakes Toronto office by Glenn Leslie I explained to Dan that if there was a conflicts problem between Enron and Westcoast and although I was willing to do what I could in the circumstances I was extremely concerned as to what could be done at that stage prior to the injunction hearing noting the conflicts problem was of Blakes own making Indeed it seemed it was the problem of a Torontobased partner who did not pay enough attention at the outset to look after his firms and his own clients interests which then needed to be resolved on an afterthefact basis Although the problem was initially misleadingly presented to me by Dan as a legal conflict on the basis of Blakes having certain confidential information regarding Westcoast which I suspected to be a justification rather than the truth when probed Dan admitted that the conflict was a business conflict rather than a legal conflict Nonetheless it was suggested by Dan that Blakes could proceed if Enron discontinued the action against Westcoast which obviously was not advice given in Enrons interest I responded that this was not only unacceptable from a strategic if not legal position and it was emphasized by me to Dan as being unnecessary and meaningless for the purposes of the injunction application as the injunction was being sought against NGX and Canadian Enerdata and no immediate remedy was being sought against Westcoast Nonetheless and as a favor to Blakes I agreed that if Blakes acted on the injunction only which as noted did not involve Westcoast scheduled for Dec th I would transition the file to another firm immediately after the injunction in an orderly manner that did not adversely affect Enrons interests This result was not apparently acceptable to Blakes Late that evening I was advised by Dan that a call was being had at Blakes first thing the next morning involving Blakes Chairman Blakes Managing Partner the Westcoast responsible partner Glenn Leslie and the Enron responsible partner Dan Fournier to discuss the issue and if it could not be resolved satisfactorily Dalton McGrath who is a more junior partner would likely be held accountable Unsatisfied that my relationship with Dalton McGrath was being put into issue and after reviewing the matter that evening at the time and inconvenience of Milnthorp at home I called Dan first thing am the next morning to nonetheless reiterate to him that I would not only undertake to relocate the file but I would try to do my best to move the file if possible ASAP even BEFORE the injunction application provided I could be satisfied that it could done in a way that was not adverse to Enrons interests Again my unusual and more than reasonable accommodations to solve a problem of Blakes own making were not apparently satisfactory as after the Blakes internal management call I was advised late that next morning by Dan that a Blakes had decided that regardless of our wishes the file must be transferred to another firm ASAP such that although Blakes would assist in the transition and the pending cross examination of Jon MacKay and Seabron Adamson Blakes would have no involvement in the briefs to be filed nor in appearing at the injunction application and would cease immediately to appear as solicitors of record notwithstanding that the injunction was then for only a few business days hence under a greatly abbreviated court ordered timeline for examinations briefs etc finding and educating replacement counsel would have to be done at year end with extraordinary demands on replacement counsel not to mention Enrons other year end commercial business concerns requiring better use and allocation of our resources b In making its decision Blakes had considered the relative complexity of the Enron vs Westcoast work I would have assumed Enron would have won this one relative annual billings I would have assume and it was later confirmed to me that Enrons annual billings were more than x Westcoasts for the past years relative strategic importance to Blakes Enron is the only international Fortune firm represented by Blakes out of its Calgary office I also would have assumed that Blakes Toronto has an interest in the deregulating Ontario power markets in which Enron expects to be a market leader I also would have assumed that Blakes would have appreciated the increased profile that Enron has given it in the pulp and paper industry the gas industry the power industry the insolvency industry the derivatives and commodity trading markets and in other jurisdictions such as in the Province of Quebec in the Province of British Columbia in Houston and with other counsel which historically act for Enron its policy not to sue established clients Although admirable and a policy with which I agree I assume it was weighed against what must also be a long standing and overriding policy of not dumping established clients especially having regard to ethical obligations the immediacy of the matter the time of year the business rather than legal conflict Enrons more than reasonable offers to move the file ASAP under its own control but even prior to the injunction application the various misdirections and excuses the fact that Blakes and particularly the Westcoast responsible partner knew or ought to have known of the conflict for approx weeks and most importantly that Blakes problem was one of its own internal making Simply put Blakes did not have the luxury of strictly relying on such a lofty principle in the circumstances c The arrangement had been preapproved by Westcoast In other words not only did Enron not have a say in the matter its litigation adversary had all the say In short it is difficult to conceive how on any reasonable basis Blakes came to its decision or decided to communicate its decision in the way it did The situation was of Blakes making Enron had given Blakes a reasonable way out and with minimal fortitude by Blakes and commercial reasonableness and respect of Westcoast towards Blakes the decision to act for Enron on the terms proposed by me was obvious Mark I have no clue why Blakes came to the decision it did in the circumstances Perhaps Blakes Toronto partner serviced clients are preferred Perhaps Blakes Calgary partners do not or do not have the ability to represent the legitimate concerns of Enron within Blakes Toronto Perhaps the Enron relationship is not adequately valued or Blakes does not like Enrons style Perhaps Blakes misjudged Enrons reaction relative to what would have been Westcoasts reaction in the alternative Whatever the decision and the approach was wholly unsatisfactory Blakes needs to be accountable and afterthefact explanations justifications confessions etc are easily given do not measure up to prior actions and are necessarily selfserving It is also noteworthy that Blakes decision partly resulted in an adjournment of the injunction application to Feb and fundamentally destroyed our opportunity to win the injunction which has since been dropped at considerable outofpocket cost and business prejudice to Enron It is also noteworthy that Westcoast soon after sold out its position in NGX to OM Gruppen and that we have dropped both NGX and OM Gruppen from the lawsuit Mark I have told Blakes that in these circumstances more than explanations excuses and promises are necessary I also told them that we are focused on developing more external counsel relations and since I have retained Oslers Stikemans and Ernst Young on various matters with good results I told Blakes that we certainly would not preclude using them but that before I did so I wanted an explanation as to how these circumstances arose and how Blakes took the decision it did and communicated it the way it did I also told Blakes that the quality and staffing of their work had been slipping for some time and that I would want a renewed commitment to staffing files with quality lawyers who are responsible for the working relationships If you want to discuss the matter in advance of your meeting please let me know Peter,haedicke-m,Managing Director

John CT Richard CT Barry CT Steve W CT Fiona CT Donna CT cc John CT Fernley CT Michael R CT Subject MG Players Roles and Facts A quick brief on the key people I have met to date follows below Fiona please pull together bios on each of Enrons team members and current job assignments at Enron and forward to Sid and John so they can know who they are dealing with take a little of the mystery out of first engagements I will forward a hardcopy diagram of the EnronMG plc Integration plan John Gill Johns role as Assistant to the Executive is a senior commercial position He was recruited hired by MG from GE Capital and has extensive experience in MA activities He is assigned to MGs merchanting division and is a relatively recent hire I believe he has been actively involved in recruiting a person structured finance team John along with Sid Tipples and David Tregar has been tasked to coordinate the EnronMG integration Sid Tipples Like John Gill Sid is an Assistant to the Executive working in the financial services division Ive had limited conversation with him He is actively involved in corp development Howard Carter Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC He started his career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals He qualified as an accountant in and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in He joined MCC physical merchanting division when it was established in He talked to me about a control function that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enrons tasks for originators and structurers He seems to pick up several functions in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the loop for HR assessments David Tregar David is the Financial Director He was educated at Lancaster University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in He became an associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in and Fellow of the Institute in Since leaving AA in he has worked continuously in commodity trading He joined MGAG in and was appointed Finance Director of MGL in Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage houses He is involved in just about everything at MG risk compliance IT treasury banking Personally David is very open and friendly Bernard Page Bernard is a long standing employee of MG since early s due to retire in October Hes had various positions of responsibilities Prior to Enrons offer he was winding down his career by planning MGs relocation from One America Square to Cannon Street Now it looks like he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to G Bernard tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MGs business etc He has a solid understanding of the financial services division and an outstanding working knowledge of MGs office system infrastructure if he doesnt know something he knows where to get the answer I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long long time Michael Farmer Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and has over years experience in the metals industry He started his career with A Strauss Co a metal exchange broker and tin merchant He also worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head copper for Philipp Brothers He jointly set up MCC which is the physical merchanting division of MG with Dieter Boettcher Toms fatherunclerelative who has subsequently retired Michael kindly explained the physical metals business to me and we immediately started connecting on commercial project development opportunities particularly in copper Michael Hutchison Michael is the Managing Director of the financial services division He was educated at Hull University He joined MGL in became a member of the Board of Directors in was appointed Joint Managing Director in and became Managing Director in Between and Michael was a committee member of the LME and from has served as a Director of the LME Michael is a very articulate actionoriented trader who just wants to get on with it Having said that he has been very patient and careful in explaining the financial markets to me and has provided me with a lot of resources videos books brochures reports on the industry Hamish Scutt Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for years and developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part which led to him being recruited and hired years ago He is very interested in promoting a credit culture that proactively assigns limits and measures performance I get the sense that he has in his quiet and friendly way pushed for more credit control in a productive fashion he wants to avoid adversarial relationships with the metals traders He is very open to Enrons ideas about credit and is known by a number of people Lee Munden Steve Young at Enron Tom McKeever Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the metals industry for over years He joined MG in when he became responsible for the Groups US operations His experience with public companies Amax as a manager and director made him a very credible manager for MG during their IPO and period of public holding He lends stability and balance to the executive team He is very practical for example he wants to know who from Enron is going to contact MG staff he doesnt want them in their enthusiasm to be open with Enron to reveal proprietary information to an unscrupulous competitor posing as Enron Tom Boettcher Tom joined MGAG in as a Vice President of the Metal Division Head of Copper He became a Director of MCC in Prior to joining MGAG he worked for years as Head of Metal Department Prokurist at Norrdeutsche Affinerie I have only had limited discussion with Tom he is preparing a list of development prospects based on a conversation I had with Michael Farmer Kevin Rhodes Kevin is the Director of Operations for the financial service division where he is responsible for the Administration department which encompasses all aspect of backoffice and trader support systems He joined the Henry Bath the warehousing company from university and joined MGL when it took over Henry Bath in I have not met Kevin yet Timothy Jones Tim is the Director of Trading for the financial services division He joined MGL in He was educated at Homefield College Christchurch and started with MGL as a trainee trader He has been MGLs Senior Trader for several years He was appointed a Director of MGL in and is a member of the LME Ring Committee I have not met Tim yet,haedicke-m,Managing Director

Find Flaws In Commodities Overhaul Bill Capital Markets Report Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation Dow Jones Energy Service Philippines Relaxes Banks Requirement To Raise Capital The Wall Street Journal Europe Danger Signs The Economist Capital Markets Report US Regulators Find Flaws in Commodities Overhaul Bill By Dawn Kopecki WASHINGTON Dow Jones US financial regulators at a hearing Wednesday faulted legislation aiming at rewriting the nations commodities laws for going too far in some areas at streamlining the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets Some officials criticized the bill introduced by Rep Thomas Ewing RIll chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management for diminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission over certain derivatives products The legislation as well as a companion bill introduced by Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar RInd would streamline the laws overseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulate some aspects of that industry Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets The Commodity Exchange Act which expires Sept determines which agency the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has jurisdiction over what derivatives products A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines has slowed progress on the legislation Annette Nazareth director of the SECs division of market regulation faulted Ewings legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futures trading facility but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the securities traded on those new facilities The SEC does not believe that there is a justification for eliminating the traditional role of other regulators including the SEC in regulating markets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and other products Nazareth said in written testimony She noted that its especially important that the SEC retain its authority when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewer investor protections than exist today on futures exchanges Treasury assistant secretary Lewis Sachs also found that section of the bill flawed saying that his agency was concerned that Ewings bill makes regulatory oversight of clearinghouses optional not mandatory He was similarly concerned about giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over all transactions conducted within a clearinghouse The exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC may preclude securities regulators from maintaining oversight of organizations that clear securitiesrelated products Sachs said in his written testimony He added that regulation of clearinghouses should be mandatory and that the SEC should oversee clearinghouse transactions for products currently under its jurisdiction Nazareth also suggested that Ewing clarify a section of the bill so that it clearly gives the SEC direct access to audit trails coordinated market surveillance and inspection authority to pursue insider trading and other fraudulent practices regarding the trading of singlestock futures The SEC should not be required to seek the permission of any other entity to protect investors she said Both Sachs and Nazareth found it troublesome that Ewings bill has a lower threshold than other proposals for determining what constitutes a sophisticated investor Thats important because the legislation allows sophisticated investors to conduct a wide variety of transactions with the least amount of scrutiny from federal regulators We do not believe that adequate consideration has been given to whether million in total assets is a sufficient indication of sophistication she said Moreover the bill grants the CFTC broad discretion to declare anyone an eligible contract participant Lugars bill as well as a report released last year by the nations top financial regulators defines a sophisticated investors as having at least million in assets Sachs also had serious reservations about the way Ewings bill relieves regulatory burdens for futures markets saying that there may be some unintended consequences for legislating relief Once such provisions are written into law the regulators will have no ability to review and amend them should subsequent market developments warrant change or should other problems arise Sachs said In addition Sachs was troubled by some changes to the rules overseeing government securities that he said could undermine the laws that Congress put in place in recent years that were designed to uphold and strengthen the integrity of the government securities market Patrick Parkinson associate director of the division of research and statistics for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve also criticized a section of the bill that he said would leave uncertainty about whether some electronic trading systems for financial contracts between professional counterparties were subject to the Commodities Exchange Act C Robert Paul general counsel for the CFTC had concerns of his own about the legislation He highlighted problems with the way the bill handles metal and energy commodities as they relate to electronic trading systems For his part Ewing warned regulators that Congress may run out of time to pass the legislation this year if the agencies cant agree on key aspects of the bill I hesitate to say lets pass those parts we agree on Its pretty easy to pat yourself on the back and just do the easy work Ewing said Several lawmakers criticized the SEC and CFTC for holding up progress for the sake of politics The two agencies have deep differences of opinion over how to regulate singlestock futures Ewings bill gives the CFTC almost exclusive authority over singlestock futures The SEC wants to share jurisdiction over the new product I really dont necessarily see this as a turf battle Nazareth said following her testimony There are significant challenges in crafting a framework that protects investors in the way they have come to expect in the securities market Dow Jones Energy Service Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation By Mika Watanabe TOKYO Dow Jones Partial deregulation of Japans power industry in March hasnt exactly charged up the countrys power sector as industrial and commercial users have yet to take advantage of their newlywon freedom to pick suppliers However the launch of online electricity trading in Japan later this year will likely lure more independent power suppliers into the market spurring trading activity and possibly prompting the government to take further deregulation steps ahead of a scheduled review in March analysts say Among the early birds hoping to provide the catalyst for this process in the form of a trading system are Japanese trading house Itochu Corp JCIT or and the US Automated Power Exchange XAUP which plan to launch a Webbased electric power exchange in November USbased Enron Corp ENE has also launched its global EnronOnline Internet trading platform for a variety of commodities and financial products and is approaching companies here with the eventual target of trading electricity Even though the market will be limited initially if the trading mechanism were there a substantial number of largelot buyers who seek lower prices would participate while potential sellers who hold excess generation capacity would also join in to make money from their idle assets said Naoto Hashimoto a senior utility analyst at Nomura Securities As of March Japans odd highvolume industrial and commercial users which together represent of total Japanese power demand are now free to choose their suppliers The potential is enormous agreed Hideki Yokoyama general manager of Itochus power project group Though the performance of our online exchange wont necessarily be stellar at first its early launch should pave a smooth way to grab some of the Japanese electricity market which is slated to open in the next stage of deregulation within three years Yokoyama also noted a chickenandegg effect while trading activity would likely lead to faster deregulation specific liberalization measures would lead to more activity Online electricity trading might take hold in Japan sooner than expected if requirements discouraging potential entrants are eased in response to growing complaints from various industries he said Even after partial deregulation independent power producers who want to sell retail electricity are still fettered by several inflexible requirements For example companies must sign a oneyear or longer transmission grid leasing contract and a costly backup supply contract with existing utilities Yokoyama predicts that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry might relax such requirements before the review Potential entrants calls for online trading could set a wave of ecommerce in motion and that would put added pressure on the regulators he said Utilities Participation Key To Boosting Liquidity Experts concede that online electricity trading liquidity is likely to be thin in the initial stage but they say volume will snowball as domestic utility giants enter the market APX and Itochu plan to form a joint venture in July for their online exchange tentatively called JPX and expect Japanese utilities as well as other energy concerns to invest in the Ybillion venture We will keep the door open for any regional power monopolies said Yokoyama adding that some utilities are now studying the trading mechanism with keen interest Its just a matter of time before some farsighted existing utilities use the new mechanism to hedge against potential risks such as losing customers and falling prices and this will consequently increase market liquidity predicted Nomuras Hashimoto Outside the power concerns the likely participation of other domestic heavyweights including Osaka Gas Co JOSG or and Nippon Telegraph Telephone Corp NTT or should also provide a tremendous boost to the electricity market said Masanori Maruo a Tokyobased utility analyst at Deutsche Securities Ltd NTT Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas Co JTYG or already unveiled in March their plan to team up in entering Japans retail electricity business Gas utilities and NTT hold massive excess power generation capacity while NTT is the countrys largest electricity user which alone represents of entire domestic consumption said Maruo The combination will be able to play a significant role in electricity trading by taking a twoway position to offset risks he said In addition some domestic and foreign financial firms including Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd JIBJ or and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co MWD are set to offer various electricitylinked derivatives designed to manage risks from fluctuations in demand and prices Such products could spur further market participation of existing utilities as well as potential sellers Analysts say the biggest longterm risks are those faced by utilities which lag behind in doing business the new way While market participation wont bring them much financial gain such power companies have the most compelling need to hedge against price fluctuations as they surrender their pricesetting monopolies to market forces It may seem that power utilities have little to gain from participating in online trading but in fact they have much to lose if they stay away from the trading mechanism as they fall behind in hedging risks said Hashimoto Eventually theyd end up playing a losers game The Wall Street Journal Europe Philippines Relaxes Banks Requirement To Raise Capital MANILA The Philippine Central Bank has decided to withdraw a requirement for banks to raise their minimum capital for a move expected to ease investors concerns over the stability of the countrys banking industry analysts said The decision to eliminate the third and final round of a capital increase for banks effectively extends to Dec the deadline for compliance with last years minimum capital requirement of billion pesos million euros for universal banks and billion pesos for commercial banks Originally universal banks were required to raise their minimum capital to billion pesos by the end of while commercial banks were required to raise their minimum capital to billion pesos In the Philippines universal banks are commercial banks with expanded licenses that allow them to venture into noncommercial banking operations such as investment banking and fund management The central banks decision to relax its capital rule will prevent a loss of confidence in banks that would otherwise have had a difficult time meeting the new requirement said Angping Associates Securities Inc The move will also prevent panic among depositors that could lead to heavy withdrawals at banks or the banks closure Angping added The central banks capital requirement for banks may be adjusted next year in line with the new riskbased capital framework contained in the recently passed General Banking Act The framework allows the central bank to impose new capital requirements based on the activities banks are involved in and the capital risks tied to them Higher capitalization may be imposed for instance on banks engaged in highrisk transactions such as derivatives trading central bank Gov Rafael Buenaventura said The central bank implemented a threestage increase of the minimum capital of banks in in a bid to strengthen the banking system to prevent a fallout from the Asian financial crisis Ironically however the higher capital requirements indirectly led to the closure of one commercial bank and heavy withdrawals at two other banks earlier this year Last month Urban Bank closed after experiencing a liquidity crunch after several days of withdrawals by depositors The withdrawals were triggered by rumors that the banks previous downgrade to a thrift bank from a commercial bank was because of cash flow problems The bank was downgraded because it couldnt meet the original billion peso capital requirement deadline for commercial banks as of the end of The Economist Danger Signs An unusual thing happened this week in America The prices of corporate bonds rose Of late they have proved a dreadful investmentworse by far than government bonds How much farther their prices will rise depends largely on what happens in the market in which they are priced the swaps market That market is in turmoil Swaps are the glue that binds together the worlds financial system First developed in the early s they now dwarf other financial instruments At the end of last year there were some trillion of swaps outstanding compared with trillion in for example international bond markets Broadly swaps come in two forms interestrate swaps and currency swaps Simply put both allow parties to exchange cashflows In a currency swap the two exchange currencies and reexchange them at maturity at the same rate In the meantime they exchange interest payments In a typical interestrate swap one side exchanges a floatingrate obligation generally based on Libor the rate at which the best banks lend to each other for a fixed one This simplicity has made swaps and interestrate swaps in particular a very useful tool They allow banks for example to match their assets and liabilities much more closely If they have lots of shortterm floatingrate liabilities such as savings accounts but longterm fixedrate assets such as loans they can swap longterm assets into shortterm ones Likewise companies can use swaps to convert fixedrate debt which investors might prefer into floatingrate debt or vice versa The level of the fixed rate in the swap reflects among other things the willingness of the market to accept corporate debt rather than government debt which means that the swap rate is calculated at a spread over government bonds Euro swapspreads have risen in recent weeks but dollar swapspreads have widened dramatically Tenyear spreads peaked at the end of May at basis points hundredths of a percentage pointa higher spread than ever before see chart on next page They have since narrowed but are still wider than at the height of the financial crisis that followed Russias default At times in recent weeks the swaps market has shut down completely nobody was willing to receive a fixed rate What on earth is going on There are broadly two sets of explanations one relatively benign the other emphatically not The benign view is that the rise in swap spreads is explicable by rising interest rates greater default risk and the relative sizes of governmentand corporatebond markets Governments are issuing fewer bonds On optimistic assumptions Americas government could buy back all its debt by American companies in contrast are borrowing hugely That makes government bonds more valuable compared with corporate debt It reflects what Stephen Compton head of bonds at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in Europe calls the privatisation of the bond markets Rising interest rates too are partly to blame for widening swap spreads When the market thinks that interest rates will rise there is more of an incentive to pay rather than receive a fixed rate That incentive is greater at times when as now longterm rates are lower than shortterm ones an inverted yield curve This means that anybody receiving a fixed longterm rate and paying a floating one loses money Then there is the increase in corporate debt Credit Suisse First Boston CSFB expects American companies to issue as many bonds this year as they did last when they sold record amounts Importantly for swap spreads one reason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares So American companies are becoming ever more highly geared and hence less creditworthy Share buybacks are running at double last years level and reckons David Goldman a strategist at CSFB will remain in vogue as long as debt is relatively cheap and firms managers think that more leverage is good for shareholder value If this were not enough swapmarket folk also point accusing fingers at Gary Gensler undersecretary at the American Treasury In March he said that federally sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which everybody assumed were guaranteed by the government were not The yield on their debt rose sharply Since they are the biggest actors in the swaps market so did swap spreads Swap knot Taken together these factors might seem enough to explain what has happened But James Bianco who runs an eponymous research firm thinks they are not Swap spreads he points out have been widening for the past three and a half yearsbefore any of these other factors cropped up And they do not explain why swap spreads have risen so fast this year Mr Bianco argues that two things dominate the pricing of interestrate swaps interest rates and credit concerns For most of the S swap rates went up and down with interest rates That relationship has now largely broken down suggests Mr Bianco because markets have become more concerned over risks to the financial system as a result of the crises of recent years If Mr Bianco is right this has important ramifications it suggests there are growing worries about the riskiness of the swaps market based on fears about the health of financial firmsby far the biggest participants Pshaw say critics there is no credit risk in the swaps market Forget about those telephonenumber figures no principal amount is exchanged in a swap so what matters is not the notional amount at risk but the cost of replacing the swapsa far lower number Moreover big banks post collateral if they are on the losing side of a swap thus eliminating even any residual risk Really Swaps are perceived as riskless That must be wrong says a treasurer at a big bank Unlike futures exchanges the swaps market looks only at current exposures not potential ones futures exchanges demand a dollop of cash up front to cover the second And the market has grown so much that these potential risks are becoming huge So it is at least plausible that people are starting to fret about the banking system But why might this be a problem in America of all places Because it is taking ever more risk to generate the returns demanded by shareholders Bank lending is growing by at an annual rate and property lending by its highest rate since If anything these rates are accelerating because after nine years of growth and few defaults banks backwardlooking risk models tell them that lending is a fine business And not just in America In Europe too banks are taking more risk to generate higher returns At best the swap market is merely reflecting this increase in risk At worst it might be signaling that the worlds financial system is in danger of becoming unglued End of ISDA Press Report Thursday June THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS

plc Steve Attached is a series of press releases by MG Plc regarding their metals website the first of which was launched on or about October I also have a message in to the attorneys at Enron that worked closely on the acquisition but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an online brokerage system like ETrade the press release on the launch of the system at the bottom of this message indicates that the site is an LME trading and execution system Ill forward over any other information I can find USA Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited NEW YORK June Reuters The worlds two largest metal exchanges said they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading system on Thursday The London Metal Exchange LME is carefully planning its introduction of electronic trading in the secondhalf of this year and refuses to be spooked by those urging action any action as long as it is now Jonathan Haslam LME director of corporate affairs told a conference in New York His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson president of the New York Mercantile Exchange NYMEX who said it would be very difficult for the new online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the success of the traditional exchanges Thompson told the Metal Bulletin ECommerce conference that said these elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk the clearing of trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments of the metals market which use the exchanges Haslam compared the LMEs trading turnover averaging billion a day with the around billion a day traded online by US energy giant Enron Corp Enrons expansion in the ecommerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas Pimpinelli senior vice president of MG London Inc part of UKbased metals trading group MG Plc In May MG agreed to a pence per share cash offer from Enron Pimpinelli said MGs own MITS online metals trading system launched in October has to date processed over contracts with an overall value of billion He told the meeting that between percent to percent of MGs order flow mostly from small metals clients was now done over the Internet Pimpinelli said the success of its Market Maker realtime trading facility within MITS for tonnages of up to a tonnes had encouraged the company to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called CTA Trader The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade larger volumes request a volume quote online and then have the facility to book the resulting live online quote Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the transaction to his individual or multiple preapproved clearing houses by way of a dropdown menu he said Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be launched in the next month or so Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli Karl Hackert head of ecommerce at US trader Koch Metals announced the impending launch of his companys own online metals trading system by the end of June Koch metals is a unit of Koch Industries Inc Hackert said the issue of the LMEs daily forward prices valuation at pm in London meant that the level of these quotes wasnt clear during the rest of the trading day Under the new Koch system prices will be updated every five seconds and out to months Koch are the first to do this offer near realtime forward prices and it is a big step forward in terms of market transparency he said Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME Making a generic mass system I dont think thats the business were in he said Steve Hays New York Commodity desk UK UPDATE MG to widen access to online metals trade By Andy Blamey Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited LONDON June Reuters UKbased metals trading group MG plc said on Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the battle for web preeminence comes to the boil MG one of the worlds leading metals traders said it would allow London Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system which had been restricted to clients with immediate effect The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system an MG spokesman said MG has so far signed up Category One ring dealing and Category Two associate broker clearing members of the LME We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new clients said Michael Hutchinson CEO of MGs Financial Services Division in a statement We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from other clearing members of the LME The wider access to MGs system need not necessarily pose a threat to other online marketplaces said Gavin Gross head of LME metals at brokerage Spectron Futures Ltd Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London Metal Exchange contracts later this month Theyre very different models MG is a principal in the market so youre looking at MG prices only Spectron is neutral were just providing a platform Its a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with each other Gross said The two can exist side by side he added Over percent of MGs clients are now using its online services the company said Market Maker turnover stood at contracts in May a growth rate of approximately percent per month since the launch in January of this year Online deals still make up a low proportion of MGs total trading turnover however MGs MITS system launched in October and has now processed over contracts with a dollar value in excess of billion and a monthly turnover in excess of billion We are using it MITS for the one or two lot small stop orders that you previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his trade said one user of an MG system at an ABCM However it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it will accept on MITS from its noncustomers he said Metals ecommerce sites are proliferating but they follow no single business model There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices intranets where big market players are cooperating different rules for access and a wide variation in revenue models the key to profitability The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture in which MG has a percent stake EMETRA is building a worldwide businesstobusiness BB ecommerce marketplace for the nonferrous metals markets including physical trading a futures and options contracts MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and Market Maker under a licence agreement with EMETRA In May MG agreed a pence per share cash offer from US energy and communications group Enron a major player in the ecommerce market through Enron Online which trades around products in some countries in currencies US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry Trading By Adam Aljewicz Dow Jones International News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LONDON Dow Jones Enrons ENE offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring dealing firm MG PLC UMGA could bring the exchange one step closer to ending open outcry trading dealers say Both the USbased energy and communications group and MG have pioneered electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to onscreen trading The LME meanwhile is also seeking to introduce onscreen technology for outofring trading sessions Were not surprised in the least to see this tieup take place an analyst at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires Everything we see now is pointing toward the removal of the ringdealing sessions and its just a matter of time before it ends all together she said MGs chairman Tom McKeever said the company wont abandon its position as an LME ring dealing member but market watchers doubt whether after years open outcry can survive on the LME as fastpaced technological change sweeps through the industry Enron has made a GBP million cash offer for Londonbased MG in a bid to gain a foothold in the billionayear world metal market The US company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity markets and with its electronic trading platform Enron On Line it has already executed more than transactions valued at over billion since its launch in November Its not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals company because theyre both very big in industrial commodities said an analyst for a USbased commission house I think its almost inevitable that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past he said Enrons move into the metals market has also been linked to the LMEs growing interest in initiating an automated trading system and has lead some market watchers to suggest that the EnronMG tieup will lead to greater consolidation among LME members Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena Out of the ring dealing firms on the LME I think only six will be able to make the transition to onscreen trading said a dealer for a Londonbased bank And thats only because we have a banking background he said The six cited are MG the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia USbased brokerage Refco Inc Credit Lyonnais Rouse Barclays Capital and Fimat Metals The LMEs existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its circular trading floor Around of the LMEs trading takes place there but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry traders say Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring or go through the Internet said a dealer Thats how it will start and will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassed altogether MG which was spun off from Germanys Metallgesellschaft last September has pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in October of MITS and MARKET MAKER its Internet trading system MG is the secondlargest physical merchant of copper nickel and aluminum in Europe after Switzerlands Glencore When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more and more uncertain about their future MG is arguably the pick of the crop in terms of stability and profitably said a dealer for a North Americanowned ring dealing firm LME Considers Screen Trading Separately the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten the demise of open outcry trading It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screentrading system for use in out of ring trading sessions and that it plans to press ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of becoming a shareholder entity Weve made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to the LMEs governance said Jonathan Haslam director of corporate affairs at the LME The LME set up an eightmember committee in February which comprised four ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy for the implementation of new technology However it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be executed although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around companies with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the onscreen technology We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be he said But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks By Adam

growing rapidly according to a recent study by Anderson Consulting Just to of business in the nonferrous industry is currently conducted online while in three to five years it will be to he said Since the launch in October volumes on MGs internet systems known as MITS and MARKET MAKER have increased by a month and cumulatively exceed contracts now MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that currently offer online trading When we launched the system we had requests from many new customers to register We registered quite a few new customers It is beyond our expectations Mr McKeever added The increase in online business on MITS has been seen round the clock as customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system We were the first to start the system It has been late coming to the metals business but we think it is good for the industry he said Last month MG announced it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund to

establish a worldwide businesstobusiness ecommerce platform for nonferrous metals This will include physical trading and the trading of options and futures contracts MG shares soared to p We didnt go into this venture intending to put anyone out of business said chairman Thomas McKeever He added that the asyetunnamed new venture would attract new clients particularly small and mediumsized companies who regard conventional LME trade as too costly and complex He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players When you develop a global marketplace you attract presumably most industry participants he added Safeguard and Nasdaqlisted ICG which already has stakes in more than companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals plastics and cattle have invested a total of million in the venture taking and pc stakes respectively MG the worlds largest copper merchant will hold an initial pc with an option to increase that to pc within eight months The company which floated last September at p after being spun off from German engineering group Metallgesellschaft will continue to operate its internet trading system Mits for existing customers It began live internet dealing of aluminium and copper in January MG expects MITS to be a hit CHRISTIAN KOHL American Metal Market Copyright Information Access Company All rights reserved COPYRIGHT Cahners Publishing Company DUSSELDORF Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader Metallgesellschaft Ltd launched its web site system that allows trade execution services on the Internet it is optimistic that the concept will be a hit Its been quite extraordinary said Alex Health MGs director of ecommerce systems Weve had something like reactions so far from both existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on He said that the noncustomers entering MGS site wwwmgltdcouk ranged from large groups MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that Heath said hed never heard of Of course its LME Week now so we are busy with socializing and making contacts there before we can reply to the requests weve received Heath said He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System MITS in time to display it at Brokers House by Tuesday evening MG Plcs recent floatation also provided a major motivation for the project to raise MGs profile he said Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes beyond the regular market activity but customers so far had used the facility for deals He added that MITS might soon contribute to MGs customer base but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be registered as regular customers At the beginning of LME Week few LME trading companies were prepared to comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading MGs presentations at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture Id be extremely disappointed if the idea didnt spread as the Internet will inevitably be a big factor in trading Heath said He noted that MG put itself under pressure by moving before some other company with a similar projectinthemaking could enter the scene Speed is a definite factor in the Internet and we can claim to be leading into the new millennium in this regard he said adding that MG received many flattering comments from brokers Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that certainly they got there before anybody else but added that they wont have very much of a lead time He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and that Barclays was making similar preparations but so far offered a web site order trading system only for nonmetallic futures He noted however that web site trading would not satisfy all requirements Its great for the small breadandbutter stuff but for longterm contracts its gonna be tricky isnt it Sellars said A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd another LME member questioned whether MG was really embracing technology or vice versa It could be a gimmick for customers and it doesnt really mean theyre successful with enlarging their customer base he said He noted that people were always interested in coming close but werent necessarily keen on taking the final step He said that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information They jumped the gun to a certain extent but well have to see if its successful or not European

chance Mark Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM Michael R Brown AM To Mark E CT Jeffrey T CT cc Subject URGENT IMPORTANT Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market FYI some interesting issues on the new exchange Michael Forwarded by Michael R BrownLONECT on Mark Elliott To Joe CT cc Michael R CT Steve W CT Fernley CT Richard CT Andrew CT Tim CT Diana CT Tina CT Michael CT Gregor CT Heribert CT Sandip CT Subject URGENT IMPORTANT Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market Joe Further to our discussion yesterday when you mentioned that you wished to commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday th August I set out below the main elements of legal risk as I see them in the various elements of the Exchange Rules You should note as a general matter that the Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the potential legal legal risk The Counterparty to our trades Enrons counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants with whom our bids and offers get matched our counterparty will not be the Exchange itself or a clearing house We shall only be told the identity of the counterpartyies with whom we have neen matched after that matching process has occurred There is no mechanism to filter counterparties based on credit quality types of counterparty etc Hence there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over whom they should do deals with Collateral Arrangements As far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the participants is concerned initial collateral of Euros is posted with the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods bank guarantee cashetc via ones clearing bank The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight on a variation margin basis if a counterparty is exposed over the level of collateral previously posted Note that the collateral which the Exchange may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered it appears that it will only cover the marktomarket value of deals struck on the Exchange which remain outstanding ie predelivery In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted it would appear that each trade will be calculated on a gross rather a net basis even for buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different counterparties The rules are very vague here I would suggest that your traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand by speaking to the Exchange if necessary exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral posting requirement Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants exposures and call for margin from the Participants clearing banks as appropriate there is an obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement It is unclear whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement I suggest that back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your trading staff Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not comply with the Rules more importantly from a good buisness practice perspective we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know these figures each day RAC and your traders should therefore check that we can do this immediately In the event that a counterparty defaults there are two points to note Firstly what constitutes a default is unclear The Rules state that a default is where a counterparty is to quote unable to meet its obligations under the Rules Strictly inability eg insolvency would not cover unwillingness eg counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay for whatever reason Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to meet obligations but of course point out that this would be for a judge ultimately to decide Secondly even if a counterparty is in default as defined there is no absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise call upon the collateral posted with it This will depend upon whether the management board of the EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so In my view the Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the individual participants as the Exchange is not the counterparty the Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of arbitration between the parties to a dispute Clearly this could be a number of weeks or months after the nonpayment dispute arose and hence increasing our credit risk Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral If the Exchange does realise the collateral however it will hold it for the benefit of all Participants Note however that this does not seem to cover previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above Taxes End consumers can be participants on the Exchange As this is the case if we get matched with an end consumer then apparently we open ourselves up to potential liability to pay German energy taxes Clifford Chance have advise me that whilst this remains an unresolved issue apparently the German fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that Germanbased entities pay such tax rather than foreignbased ones such as ECTRL which is our trading participant If you require further details on this please refer to Tina Ward in Tax Department Renewable Energy Sources Act Again if we as a seller were matched with an endconsumer then under this Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately of the energy sold from a renewable source I understand that this is approximately times as expensive as normal domestic power coming in at around pfennigs per kWh It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange although Cliffords view is that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism May be your traders should look into this in greater detail should it be of concern Settlement On a purely logistical level for your general information please note that physical power delivery is T whereas Buyer settles T The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers via the Exchnage It is unclear how the mechanics of this work they are not dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent I would suggest that your trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately by speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary It should also be borne in mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the T framework IMPORTANT NOTE Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a formal and final CACs process the rules have totally altered since we CACsd it last time three weeks ago However I understand that you would like to be able to trade from tomorrow which will be a few days in advance of the CACs process additional rules in German have only just been sent to me and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these In this respect please note that ECTRL is joining as a MarketMaker and hence under the Exchange Rules if you wish to proceed we would have the obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market opening hours The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of time for which bids offers are active minimum maximum volumes bid offerred the width of spreads etc I understand from Clifford Chance that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules What we do know at the moment is that if we fail too often to quote as a market maker then the exchange can remove suspend us as a trading participant In order to mitigate your risk at present therefore you may wish to consider the size of volumes we would quote and width of spreads etc and discuss with RAC and or Credit beforehand Finally I understand that a Dresdners banking terms for us have still not been agreed apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston Legal Department level and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are agreed and b I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could trade Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over a and I understand that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing arrangements Subject to clearing the items in a and b and discussing volumes spread etc with RAC Credit etc if you wish to proceed tomorrow please let me know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them of this our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would write to them when we wished our membership to go active Kind regards Mark,haedicke-m,Managing

Disaster Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM IssueAlert AM To cc Subject PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulat ion or Protecting Itself from Economic Disaster Miss last week Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE customers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure temporary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and transfer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it continues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this month DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDD Need to design and implement your IT infrastructure Learn more about SCIENTECHs Information Technology team and what they can do

child Whether the term cruelty in o b is unconstitutionally vague Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Herronen eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The term cruelty as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague because it gives fair notice to a person of ordinary intelligence and a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited or required In this case a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that hitting a year old girl more than once in the face severe enough to necessitate a hospital visit pulling her hair or pushing her into a wall causing her to become dizzy would fall within the purview of cruelty The family court order taki ng jurisdiction over the minor child was affirmed Full Text Opinion Criminal Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Denial of defense motion for a lineup Prosecutorial misconduct Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Cain eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendants untimely motion for a lineup An eyewitness testified that she was only an arms length away from defendant when she saw him key the complainants vehicle then enter a business The manager of the business notified of th e keying incident shortly after it occurred testified that defendant was the only person in the building lobby matching the perpetrators description Although eyewitness identification was a material issue a lineup would not have resolved any mistaken identification in this case The trial court also properly considered the untimeliness of the motion and the possible hardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness who resided in another state Defendants conviction of malicious destruction of proper ty over was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether the trial court erred in finding that defendant was the carjacker Identification Witness credibility Whether the lineup was undu ly suggestive Sufficiency of evidence to convict of carjacking Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Fordham eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan Since both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the man who stole the victims car and the trial court concluded that the victi m was not confused when he identified the defendant as the carjacker the tri al courts finding that defendant was one of the carjackers was not clearly erroneous There was sufficient evidence based on the identification eviden ce for a rational trier of fact to have concluded that defendant committed the carjacking Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Sufficient evidence of intent to convict for arson of a dwelling house Whether defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the requisite intent Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Moss eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously regardless of whether he was intoxicated to some degree when he set fire to the victims home Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately hours afte r the fire his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o n the night of the fire The testimony indicated that even if defendant was intoxicated he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif ic intent The evidence established that defendant appeared at the victims home three times and was there purposely prior to the fire defendant h ad no reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims house defendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them and defendant followed through with the threats later that night when he purchased kerosene transported it to the victims home poured it onto the porch and into the mail slot and set fire to the home Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Whether there was sufficient evidence to support convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses attempted false pretenses and stealin g or retaining a financial transaction device Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Pitts eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan There was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave encouragement that assisted the commission of the crimes to support his convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempted false pretenses Although defendant threw torn pieces of paper from the passenger door of the vehicle during the pursuit by the police the credit card numbe rs recovered from the torn pieces of paper were not similar to the credit card numbers given by defendants brother to purchase merchandise There was no evidence associating defendant with the representations that were made to t he employees by his brother regarding the validity of the credit card numbers Defendants convictions for aiding and abetting false pretenses and attempt ed false pretenses were reversed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Suppression of defendants inculpatory statements Whether interrogation was custodial Whether defendants statements were knowingly and voluntarily made Totality of the circumstances Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Rose eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court erred in suppressing defendants statements to police on th e basis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings from the outset of the interview Defendant agreed to speak with the police drove himself to the station and was informed prior to the interview that he was not under arrest and was free to leave At no time was he told that he was not free to leave and the door was left open The officers failure to tell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac t that defendant was told he was free to leave or render the interview a custodial one Further under the totality of the circumstances defendant s statements were knowingly and voluntarily made and were not the product of psychological coercion Defendant was years old had completed three yea rs of college and discerned the focus of the officers inquiries soon after t he interview began The trial courts order suppressing defendants statements was reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Prosecutorial misconduct Other acts evidence Admission of witness testimony Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name People v Vaughn eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam OConnell Kelly and Whitbeck Although the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an accomplices plea agreement to bolster that witness testimony defendant d id not show that he was prejudiced The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc t by eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the witness to testify truthfully because the prosecutor did not personally vouch for the witness credibility Affirmed Full Text Opinion Family Law Back to Quicklinks Issues Modification of a custody order without conducting an evidentiary hearing Trial courts failure to identify the change of circumstances whether an established custodial environment existed or an analysis of the best interest factors Reassignment of custody matter to a different judge Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Belgiorno v Belgiorno eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Wilder Smolenski and Whitbeck The trial court erred because it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing before it entered an order modifying the parties custody The trial court s order placing physical custody of the parties minor child with plaintiffmother was vacated and remanded to conduct an evidentiary hearing state specific findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record determine whether an established custodial environment existed determine whether proper cause or a change of circumstances existed tha t justified a change of custody and address the best interest factors to determine the best interest of the child Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights pursuant to oo baii ci g and j Proper service of summons for adjudicative hearing Failure t o challenge one of the statutory grounds for termination Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Glover eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Neff Talbot and Sullivan The family court did not err in finding that statutory grounds for termination of respondentmothers parental rights were established by clea r and convincing evidence Respondent did not begin to work on her treatment plan until approximately one month before the termination hearings Further while she was required to seek substance abuse treatment or submit to drug testing she failed to do either Since respondent made no significant progress in these areas and considering her past history respondents parental rights were properly terminated under oo bci g and j Affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks This summary also appears under Constitutional Law Issues Jurisdiction over the minor child Whether the term cruelty in o b is unconstitutionally vague Jury instructions Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Herronen eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The term cruelty as used in the statute is not unconstitutionally vague because it gives

family court order taki ng jurisdiction over the minor child was affirmed Full Text Opinion Back to Quicklinks Issues Termination of parental rights Trial court inquiry into respondent s ability to pay support where there was an existing support order Appointme nt of counsel in a stepparent adoption Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name In re Keller eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Fitzgerald Hood and McDonald The termination of respondentfathers parental rights was reversed because the trial court erred by finding that o a was satisfied on the basis that respondent had the ability to pay child support and failed to do so I t was improper for the trial court to inquire into respondents ability to pa y child support under o a where there was an existing support order T he order that reserved the question of support because respondent was incarcerated constituted a judicial determination that respondent lacked th e ability to pay The trial court also erred by failing to appoint counsel fo r respondent upon his request because in a stepparent adoption proceeding und er o a the trial court has discretion to appoint counsel for an indige nt nonconsenting parent Full Text Opinion Litigation Back to Quicklinks Issues Standing Case or controversy Absence of an injuryinfact Challenge to constitutionality of a legalized gambling scheme Standard of review Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v Michigan Gaming Control Bd Court US Court of Appeals Sixth Circuit Case Name Barden Detroit Casino LLC v The City of Detroit eJournal Number Judges Nelson Moore and Wilhoit The district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs suit against both the ci ty and state defendants because plaintiff an unsuccessful bidder for a licens e to operate a Detroit casino lacked standing The court in Lac Vieux previously held that the state law preference exempting certain preferred developers from the competitive bidding process and allowing a tiebreaking preference for applicants that had supported the initiative legalizing casi no gambling in Detroit had been eliminated Since the preference was ineffective there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th e state defendants in regard to the state statute As to the city defendants the mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta ge of the competitive selection process until after plaintiff had already been eliminated from the competition Therefore the preference was never applie d to plaintiffs detriment and plaintiff suffered no actual injury Affirmed Full Text Opinion Malpractice Back to Quicklinks Issues Medical malpractice Statute of limitations Discovery rule Whethe r defendants failure to produce plaintiffs medical records excused timely filing of a presuit notice Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name Cabell v Carino eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam McDonald Sawyer and White The trial court properly granted defendantorthopedist summary disposition on the grounds that plaintiffs presuit notice was not filed within two years of the act or omission that was the basis of the claim While plaintiffs claim accrued in March he did not file a notice of intent to sue unti l June Plaintiffs assertion that he did not discover his claim until h e received his medical records from defendant in April was without merit Plaintiffs deposition testimony established that by June at the latest he was aware of a problem with his toe following defendants treatment for an ankle fracture and actually believed that the cast defendant placed on his ankle and foot had caused the problem Plaintiffs attorney was investigating his claim in October Plaintiffs claim tha t defendants failure to produce plaintiffs medical records in response to h is request excused the timely filing of the notice of intent also failed Affirmed Full Text Opinion Workers Compensation Back to Quicklinks Issues Claim for weekly wage loss benefits based on mental disability The Gardner formulation of the statutory test for determining whether an employ ee has suffered a compensable mental disability The Workers Compensation Appellate Commission WCAC Court Michigan Court of Appeals Unpublished Case Name White v Department of Agric eJournal Number Judges Per Curiam Owens Jansen and Burns The magistrate properly determined that although an incident where plaintiffs supervisor kicked him to wake plaintiff up after he nodded off on the job may have appeared objectively insignificant to the average person there was substantial evidence from plaintiffs physician establishing that because it would not take much of a stimulus to trigger a response in a patient with a preexisting borderline personality the kicking incident contributed to aggravated or accelerated plaintiffs mental condition in a significant manner All that is statutorily required are actual events of employment even if objectively unimportant that contribute to aggravate or accelerate a mental disability in a significant manner The decision of the WCAC reversing the magistrate and denying plaintiffs claim for weekly wage loss benefits on the basis of a mental disability was reversed and remanded the case for reinstatement of the magistrates award Full Text Opinion fields of practice

Enrons endorsement and adoption of the attached statement of principles on Security and Human Rights and my response is noted after each question Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its endorsement of these polices No If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy Given the limited physical presence of EGM in foreign locations I would not expect implementation to be a problem Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy The commitment under the Consultation and Advice section of the statement on Interactions between Companies and Public Security provides In their consultations with host governments Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote adherence to international law enforcement standards particularly those reflected in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms I believe we should take note that all appropriate measures is very broad and could publicly be construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular country that fails to abide by these principles My response pertains only to the operations of

been worked out over the past several months by a task force of the US and UK governments along with representatives of industry including Enron and NGOs including Amesty and Human Rights Watch under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and Foreign Secretary Cook As a result we really dont have the ability to change the text which is fixed As you know Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of their intrinsic value and their community relations impactsThese guidelines would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board adopted last year which really do not touch on security matters as such I have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these issues are of primary concern I am separately collecting commentsconcerns from within EES and EECC The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt of the Corp PR group Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and Pete Vandergam at Corp Security for their views of whether this can be implemented by Enron We as the legal department have been asked to express our view on are the following a Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its endorsement of these polices b If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy c Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials or have one of your lawyers do so You might need to consult with your operation personnel for their practical views as well I would be grateful if you could express any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November Wednesday so that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out The deadline for Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been extended from the November deadline expressed in the attached to November To allow time for Enron to deal with responses we have been asked to get our feed back to Lauren by November Thursday You canemail your comments or phone them to me at If I get suffucient expressions of interest for a

David Redmond AM To Mark CT cc Paul CT Ted CT Peter CT Richard CT Subject Re issue wcompliance ertificate Mark I am not sure I follow this but I will attempt to present my interpretation of your note I am only restrained from trading those items in clause one if I am responsible for trading them at Enron and equities falls under securities in clause one Equities fall under clause one and are therefore not included in clause two Therefore since I do not trade equities for Enron I can trade them o n my personal account Brent Crude futures I would argue are financial instruments included i n clause one I am not responsible for trading them for Enron If they fall under clause one they are not included in clause two Does this mean since they are not in clause two and I do not trade them for Enron I can trade them on my personal account Perhaps you could give me a call Thank you Dave From Mark Taylor on CST To Cassandra NRON cc David CT Paul CT Peter CT Richard CT Subject Re issue wcompliance ertificate This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities interest rates and currencies The older versions of the policy provided th at no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyone other than Enron Beyond that no Enron employee could trade a commodity which was within their area of responsibility For example I was not permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but since intere st rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility I could trad e them As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more difficult to identify the scope of the companys concern much less to articulate it We did however take a stab at it and the result is below This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next versio n of the Policy For now I would suggest that the term security highlighted below should be read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered i n the second numbered clause ie the word other refers to items other tha n those listed in clause i The result is that an Enron employee who does not trade financial instruments securities financial assets or liabilitie s for Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account To take this a step further one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of energy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his or her own account but could trade other equities if it were me I would certainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it Of course a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for personal trading metals ag commodities bandwidth freight lumber amon g many others for all employees As I remember it this was done purposely and if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise to discuss the matter with the RAC Group as they make suggestions for Policy revisions to the Enron Corp board

status Are we making changes suggested by our Mexican lawyers Mark Forwarded by Mark E HaedickeHOUECT on PM Weiland William PM To Haedicke Mark E cc Banczak Peggy J Dilg Joe Subject Choice of Mexican Law VitroMonterrey Project Peggy Banczak called me yesterday to say that the InterAmerican Development Bank IADB had indicated its refusal to fund its loan to the appropriate ENE borrower in connection with the EnronVitro Monterry Cogeneration Project Project unless the PPAs and construction contracts ie those contracts to be concluded between Mexican entities and calling for performance in Mexico be governed by Mexican law Peggy explained that after long negotiation ENE had been able to convince Vitro and Cementos Apasco and other power purchasersconstruction companies to agree that their contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this great success IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts be governed by Mexican law Peggy and I talked with Rogelio LopezVelarde and Peggy subsequently provided me copies of three memoranda dated August September and September addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell Patterson from Rogelio LopezVelarde and Amanada Valdez In the August memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez analyzed the enforceability of certain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial de Mexico S de RL de CV and Apasco should that agreement be governed by Mexican law They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement were to be governed by Mexican law In the September memorandum Rogelio and Ms Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the Suspension Remedy contained in Section of the PPA In their memorandum of September they opined principally that the provision of Section of the PPA specifically denying each Capacity User the right to terminate the PPA except in the case of a Producer Event of Default under Section a sic has occurred and the Project has been Abandoned was unenforceable I have reviewed the three memoranda but I have not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limited review of the EnronVitro Amparo matter we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados memoranda and opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application of Mexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB now insists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability of provisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm however to be well reasoned and written As I have not seen the underlying documents I am not able to determine whether the August memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the Challengeable Clauses in the PPA in Section IA My guess is that the form from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used on other occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to be governed by laws of jurisdictions that have experience considering sophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputes specifically arising under power purchase agreements If ENE does agree to subject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexican law it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affected agreements to be absolutely sure that all of the Challengable Clauses are identified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make them enforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions as is are fully understood and evaluated by ENE I do have the following specific comments concerning the August memorandum If they already have not been made is it possible still to convince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados have suggested Based on the Lopez Velarde Hefty Abogados memos it seems to me that ENE as a condition to agreeing to accept Mexican law as the governing law would want to negotiate at least the material changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde Heftye Abogados firm in the memoranda If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or is possible only to negotiate some of the changes with respect to the Discretionary Performance Prohibition and the Discretionary Condition Prohibition outlined in Sections I A and B would only the specifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be rendered unenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable if either performance of portions of the PPA as opposed to performance of the entire agreement are left to the unilateral discretion of one of the parties or compliance with some as opposed to all of the conditions rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions that individually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA If there are a number of Performance or Condition Prohibitions that are not amended could they in the aggregate be deemed sufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause in the PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to make enforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affected agreement Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary Condition Prohibitions constitute events of default even if the party in whose favor they run do not attempt to enforce them constitute an event of default that would afford the innocent party the right to demand rescission of the PPA I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain dispute resolution provisions that would subject disputes to international arbitration Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are not renegotiated the fact that Mexican law if agreed as the governing law will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor that could result in a more independent consideration and resolution of the interpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may arise under the contracts If you have questions or wish to discuss this matter please call me at William H Weiland CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE The information in this email

believe such tools would clearly add value immediately Mark Mark NRON PM To Rob nron Mark E CT cc Subject eLaw and eVelocity RobMark I wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of eLaw and eVelocity eLaw I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week The reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron to the tune of MM to MM The secondary focus was on the product and its usefulness to Enron Steve made it clear that any funding decision would be driven by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and thus it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go The demonstration of the tool was impressive Though it does act as a traditional shopping type site in many respects it also has functionality to create a myelaw page customized to the information you the user are the most interested in seeing It also allows for a query into further information which query is then forwarded to the law firms or firm supporting the practice area eg LaborEmployment for comment There is also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded organized and maintained including legal opinions memoranda on various topics and form pleadingsdocuments This area is secure from the balance of the site so that other users cannot access the information The loading process is fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment Some of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a new version coming out early Q and by the end of there is the plan to have at least or so practice areas available Right now the focus is on Environmental Intellectual Property Health Care and Tax I think the tool could be useful especially in relation to the organization of information we obtain from our outside sources It may also complement the websiteportal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the websiteportal development process I would be curious to see however what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function eVelocity I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs sp to discuss the eVelocity tool It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm and our legal department solely for the movement review and payment of law firm invoices While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a matter management system it can itself be used as a matter management tool The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of rules that are applicable to law firm invoices For example say Enron does not pay more than per page of copying This can be set as a rule so that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than this amount per page would be automatically rejected The rejection would then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to the system This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review but notes that it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney is alerted to the issue The system does identify the problem so you do not have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules It is possible to establish rules that would allow an invoice presuming it complied with all rules to be automatically approved and moved to AP for payment This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system but it could be done In addition to the above functionality the system can also track matters budgets for matters costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter Reports can be generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters Finally since it is a webbrowser based system implementation is not difficult and there is not a lot of IT involvement needed I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed and received the response that there really is no such need Mike indicated a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp portalwebsite it makes sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking Whether or not it is eVelocity or another comparable tool would require further research into the available

Citibank Mark Randy NRON AM To Sami nron Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob NRONDEVELOPMENT John nron Mark E CT Subject Re Elektros telecom project For what it is worth I agree with Samis concern that we may laboring under a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in a Brazilian contract between Brazilian contracting parties relating to a Brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a Brazilian court Inevitably we have to fight hard for these concessions in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration not to mention blood and sweat on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts If we are really being taken by these crafty Brazilian lawyers like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I think we should rethink the policy in this specific instance Elektro because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts we had a number of cases you will recall when we bought it and have had others since It is clearly not the only substantial highprofile Brazilian company Enron has down here making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as foreigners the way we do elsewhere By all means we should check with Jose Emilio but if he shares Samis and I have to say my concerns I think we should consider making a special rule for BraziltoBrazil contracting transactions Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo in English with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts federal if possible of Sao Paulo The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision thinking we are safe and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice due process etc If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions let me know Randy Sami Arap AM To Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Randy NRONDEVELOPMENT Rob NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re Elektros telecom project Thanks again Bob I will call Jos Emilio to check I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil whether international or local aspects are under discussion provided that you follow the exequatur procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago However the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case in accordance with Article IIIIII of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code In such event if Enron please note that I am always only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in So Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and at the same time or at a later stage one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void I will be in Houston on Friday January and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls andor Jim Derrick Regards Sami Robert C NRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Sami NRON cc Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT ENRON Randy Young Rob Walls Subject Re Elektros telecom project Sami I agree on the issue of Brazilian law But on the question of foreign arbitration our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec As to local arbitration we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than We should probably also have a cumulative cap of say million On bigger deals Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more is at stake is to agree to ICCadministered arbitration in Sao Paulo In this case I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award whether that be ad hoc ICC FIESP or CanadianBrazilian C of C Jose Emilio would have a view on this too Hope this is helpful Bob Sami NRON PM To Michelle BlaineENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Robert C WilliamsENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re Elektros telecom project Michelle and Bob Thanks for the reply The issue here is when Brazilian entities only are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy and please correct me if I am wrong is that when Enron as a foreign company is dealing with foreign governments governmental agencies or governmentowned companies or private companies from the host company we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law In case of Elektro as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity EAS ECE etc entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil the contracting parties must comply with local public policy I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism we are all aware of Enrons policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in So Paulo To me the question is whether we use ad hoc arbitration OR institutional arbitration ie submit the matter to FIESP or the CanadianBrazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the arbitration administrator FYI since I joined Enron Ive been told that all of Enrons Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts dispute resolution mechanism In my opinion this concept may not work the way Enron wants If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and suppose both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY it is most likely that in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case You may ask why The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction Id very much like to emphasize that while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that at the end of the day I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts Since Odebrechts counterparties did not do their homework properly Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of The Civil Code of ractified the use of arbitration however it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts Only in with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act Law it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts With respect to enforceability please note that the arbitral award is final binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an exequatur Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter Rgds Sami

Mark Haedicke Maurits Schouten Robert Mark Steve Targett Teruo Tanaka Thomas Montag Tim Fredrickson cc Subject Board Matters I have spoken with a number of you regarding several Boardrelated matters and wanted to provide that information to everyone These relate to the following Nominating Committee Results Citigroup Board Meeting Schedule Strategic Planning Meeting Schedule PreStrategic Planning Lunches Nominating Committee Results The Nominating Committee has completed its deliberations and has recommended individuals for election at this years AGM to twoyear terms In addition to the reelection of Ernie Jerry Jose Manuel Keith Maurits Terry Tom and Tim the Nominating Committee has proposed the following individuals for election Kaushik Amin Managing Director at Lehman Brothers NY cohead of their global fixed income division Fred Janbon Global Head of Fixed Income at BNP Paribas London Azam Mistry Director Head of Risk Management AdvisorTreasury and Capital Markets HSBC Hong Kong and CoChair of our AsiaPacific Steering Committee Thank you to everyone on the nominating commitee for your efforts particularly those of you who had an opportunity to meet these and other prospective nominees Citigroup The Nominating Committee chose not to nominate anyone from Citigroup for election at this years AGM We have emphasized to Citigroup that this decision is due to a variety of factors including lack of attendance at Board meetings by current and past Board members and the fact that Citi has had a seat on the Board continuously since the Association was formed We have encouraged them to remain involved in ISDA activities with a view to rejoining the Board at the earliest possible juncture Please encourage your Citigroup counterparts to get involved or remain involved in the Associations activities Both Ravit and Thierry Sciard who contacted us to offer himself as an alternative for the position were upset by the decision but it is not clear what the longterm effects will be The most immediate tangible effect is that Citi has indicated that it is withdrawing its cosponsorship of the Tuesday and Wednesday evening events at the Washington AGM There is a possibility that Lehman may be interested in sponsorship Board Meeting Schedule Please make note of the Board meeting schedule for the remainder of the year April and over lunch each day at the AGM in Washington May in Kyoto more details below September in London November in New York note this is a change from prior schedules distributed Strategic Planning Session May and are the dates of our strategic planning session which this year will be at the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto The details on the Miyako Hotel are MIYAKO HOTEL Sanjo Keage Kyoto Japan Phone Fax httpwwwmiyakohotelcojp The schedule is slightly different from past sessions I will provide more details on the specifics but for your planning purposes you should arrange to be in Kyoto for lunch on Wednesday May Bullet trains from Tokyo that morning will get you there in time We will have dinner in the hotel Wednesday evening after our afternoon session On Thursday May we will start with breakfast and have a working lunch with the session ending around The afternoon will be spent visiting temples and perhaps going on a sake tasting tour Fortunately I do not believe that Francis Ford Coppola is a sake producer Dinner that evening will be at a restaurant and will be accompanied by a Geisha dance Please plan to stay for all of the events There is nothing planned for Friday so that everyone particularly the Europeans can get planes out of Osaka or Tokyo on Friday morning that will get them back for the weekend PreStrategic Planning Luncheons As in the past we will hold a series of luncheons in London New York and Tokyo where we will invite senior executives from member firms to share with us their thoughts on issues affecting the industry The tentative schedule and locations for these lunches is as follows Wednesday May London UBS hosted by Tim Frederickson Friday May New York AIG hosted by Ernie Patrikis Tuesday May Tokyo Royal Park Hotel hosted by Koshikawasan In addition to attending the luncheon closest to your office please consider arriving in Tokyo a day early to join us at the Tokyo session Again more details will follow In the meantime I would welcome any suggestions for individuals we should invite to these luncheons in the various centers I know this is a long email but it covers the critical dates for the coming months in one fell swoop I am on holiday the week of Feb and will be

are meeting in Houston next week regarding Blakes their mismanagement of the NGX litigation and other matters I am providing you the following report so as the facts and issues are clear I am taking the time to send you this report because I am concerned that Dan Fournier has demonstrated to date that he either does not understand the facts and issues which is amazing or believes he can obfuscate and resolve the issues through political maneuvering You will recall that this matter kicked off late in Sept with NGX giving us two days notice that they were taking over control of the methodology for determining the prevalent gas indices effective Oct You will also recall that the matter was of significant concern to John Lavorato and Greg Whaley among others and following a conference call with John Greg Steve Kean Rick Shapiro and others it was agreed that we would consider our legal remedies including that I would prepare a draft stern letter to NGX advising them of our concerns and the potential for litigation with Enron both for internal review and review by outside counsel I discussed the facts and the letter with Blakes Dalton McGrath who advised me that he would also be discussing the matter with a competition law partner in Toronto In the end Blakes had some minor comments on the letter and provided a cover letter confirming that in the circumstances we had a difficult put provable case One issue raised by the letter was the potential involvement of NGXs shareholders for a number of reasons including i NGX had only two shareholders Westcoast Energy and OM Gruppen who to our knowledge controlled the mind and management of NGX ii OM Gruppen is in the business around the world of purchasing or creating electronic exchanges and had recently purchased its position in NGX from Westcoast Westcoast is the sole shareholder of Engage Energy a energy trading competitor iii NGXs transaction for acquiring control of the indices was an aggressive structured attack designed to cause harm to EOL and regain market share that EOL had taken away and iv NGX is a limited liability entity with little in hard assets and therefore may have been judgment proof Obviously if the evidence or commercialstrategic reasons warranted not proceeding against the shareholders at any time it was our intention not to continue to proceed against them In short Blakes was aware from the outset of our intention to involve Westcoast in any litigation As expected we did not receive a satisfactory response to our letter to NGX and between late Sept and Nov the date we filed the lawsuit and applied for injunctive relief I had countless further discussions with Blakes to draft and redraft and redraft again a Statement of Claim and Motion documents all of which clearly involved Westcoast as a named defendant Although the Court would not grant an injunction ex parte an aggressive timeline was established for filing affidavits and briefs completing crossexaminations etc with the injunction application set for Dec to our strategic advantage We were proceeding vigorously on this basis when to my surprise I received a phone call from Dan Fournier on Dec weeks into the matter to advise me that there was a legal conflict problem involving Westcoast who is occasionally represented out of Blakes Toronto office by Glenn Leslie I explained to Dan that if there was a conflicts problem between Enron and Westcoast and although I was willing to do what I could in the circumstances I was extremely concerned as to what could be done at that stage prior to the injunction hearing noting the conflicts problem was of Blakes own making Indeed it seemed it was the problem of a Torontobased partner who did not pay enough attention at the outset to look after his firms and his own clients interests which then needed to be resolved on an afterthefact basis Although the problem was initially misleadingly presented to me by Dan as a legal conflict on the basis of Blakes having certain confidential information regarding Westcoast which I suspected to be a justification rather than the truth when probed Dan admitted that the conflict was a business conflict rather than a legal conflict Nonetheless it was suggested by Dan that Blakes could proceed if Enron discontinued the action against Westcoast which obviously was not advice given in Enrons interest I responded that this was not only unacceptable from a strategic if not legal position and it was emphasized by me to Dan as being unnecessary and meaningless for the purposes of the injunction application as the injunction was being sought against NGX and Canadian Enerdata and no immediate remedy was being sought against Westcoast Nonetheless and as a favor to Blakes I agreed that if Blakes acted on the injunction only which as noted did not involve Westcoast scheduled for Dec th I would transition the file to another firm immediately after the injunction in an orderly manner that did not adversely affect Enrons interests This result was not apparently acceptable to Blakes Late that evening I was advised by Dan that a call was being had at Blakes first thing the next morning involving Blakes Chairman Blakes Managing Partner the Westcoast responsible partner Glenn Leslie and the Enron responsible partner Dan Fournier to discuss the issue and if it could not be resolved satisfactorily Dalton McGrath who is a more junior partner would likely be held accountable Unsatisfied that my relationship with Dalton McGrath was being put into issue and after reviewing the matter that evening at the time and inconvenience of Milnthorp at home I called Dan first thing am the next morning to nonetheless reiterate to him that I would not only undertake to relocate the file but I would try to do my best to move the file if possible ASAP even BEFORE the injunction application provided I could be satisfied that it could done in a way that was not adverse to Enrons interests Again my unusual and more than reasonable accommodations to solve a problem of Blakes own making were not apparently satisfactory as after the Blakes internal management call I was advised late that next morning by Dan that a Blakes had decided that regardless of our wishes the file must be transferred to another firm ASAP such that although Blakes would assist in the transition and the pending cross examination of Jon MacKay and Seabron Adamson Blakes would have no involvement in the briefs to be filed nor in appearing at the injunction application and would cease immediately to appear as solicitors of record notwithstanding that the injunction was then for only a few business days hence under a greatly abbreviated court ordered timeline for examinations briefs etc finding and educating replacement counsel would have to be done at year end with extraordinary demands on replacement counsel not to mention Enrons other year end commercial business concerns requiring better use and allocation of our resources b In making its decision Blakes had considered the relative complexity of the Enron vs Westcoast work I would have assumed Enron would have won this one relative annual billings I would have assume and it was later confirmed to me that Enrons annual billings were more than x Westcoasts for the past years relative strategic importance to Blakes Enron is the only international Fortune firm represented by Blakes out of its Calgary office I also would have assumed that Blakes Toronto has an interest in the deregulating Ontario power markets in which Enron expects to be a market leader I also would have assumed that Blakes would have appreciated the increased profile that Enron has given it in the pulp and paper industry the gas industry the power industry the insolvency industry the derivatives and commodity trading markets and in other jurisdictions such as in the Province of Quebec in the Province of British Columbia in Houston and with other counsel which historically act for Enron its policy not to sue established clients Although admirable and a policy with which I agree I assume it was weighed against what must also be a long standing and overriding policy of not dumping established clients especially having regard to ethical obligations the immediacy of the matter the time of year the business rather than legal conflict Enrons more than reasonable offers to move the file ASAP under its own control but even prior to the injunction application the various misdirections and excuses the fact that Blakes and particularly the Westcoast responsible partner knew or ought to have known of the conflict for approx weeks and most importantly that Blakes problem was one of its own internal making Simply put Blakes did not have the luxury of strictly relying on such a lofty principle in the circumstances c The arrangement had been preapproved by Westcoast In other words not only did Enron not have a say in the matter its litigation adversary had all the say In short it is difficult to conceive how on any reasonable basis Blakes came to its decision or decided to communicate its decision in the way it did The situation was of Blakes making Enron had given Blakes a reasonable way out and with minimal fortitude by Blakes and commercial reasonableness and respect of Westcoast towards Blakes the decision to act for Enron on the terms proposed by me was obvious Mark I have no clue why Blakes came to the decision it did in the circumstances Perhaps Blakes Toronto partner serviced clients are preferred Perhaps Blakes Calgary partners do not or do not have the ability to represent the legitimate concerns of Enron within Blakes Toronto Perhaps the Enron relationship is not adequately valued or Blakes does not like Enrons style Perhaps Blakes misjudged Enrons reaction relative to what would have been Westcoasts reaction in the alternative Whatever the decision and the approach was wholly unsatisfactory Blakes needs to be accountable and afterthefact explanations justifications confessions etc are easily given do not measure up to prior actions and are necessarily selfserving It is also noteworthy that Blakes decision partly resulted in an adjournment of the injunction application to Feb and fundamentally destroyed our opportunity to win the injunction which has since been dropped at considerable outofpocket cost and business prejudice to Enron It is also noteworthy that Westcoast soon after sold out its position in NGX to OM Gruppen and that we have dropped both NGX and OM Gruppen from the lawsuit Mark I have told Blakes that in these circumstances more than explanations excuses and promises are necessary I also told them that we are focused on developing more external counsel relations and since I have retained Oslers Stikemans and Ernst Young on various matters with good results I told Blakes that we certainly would not preclude using them but that before I did so I wanted an explanation as to how these circumstances arose and how Blakes took the decision it did and communicated it the way it did I also told Blakes that the quality and staffing of their work had been slipping for some time and that I would want a renewed commitment to staffing files with quality lawyers who are responsible for the working relationships If you want to discuss the matter in advance of your meeting please let me know Peter,haedicke-m,Managing Director

announcement on Thursday John To be sent to All Enron Europe all employees in Japan all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the company Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals Power Plant Development via our investment in EnCom Coal LNG Weather Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enrons traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather Oil LNG Coal and Shipping We expect to continue our general recruiting of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron The EquityFXInterest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year The EnCom group which is our power plant development business with minority partners and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business These employees remain in Enron Credit a part of Enron Europe EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand by year end The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report to Mark Evans General Counsel in London The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy head of RAC for Enron Europe The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by JanErland Bekeng will continue to

provide support for Global Markets EBS Industrial Markets We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise

nronXgate PM To Mark E CT cc Subject Davis reaffirms that he cant be trusted Mark This article confirms your skepticism about the CDWR deal Davis is already planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed earlier this year The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor its agreements Look at Daviss spin on breaching contract provisions State negotiators worried little about the confidentiality clauses in their haste to sign the contracts but now administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in longterm contracts From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking longterm contracts once prices go down in a year or two We didnt think a lot about the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the lights on But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment clause On another note thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday I am thrilled to be working for Enron Meeting with you Jim Derrick and others in the legal department reinforced my decision to join your company I am excited about our prospects for the future and will work hard to continue to add value and keep your confidence Best regards Steve Davis to divulge details of costly energy buys By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO Amid mounting attacks on Gov Gray Davis energycrisis secrecy administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin revealing full details of the states costly lastminute power purchases aimed at thwarting blackouts The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it will start disclosing information on the initial multimilliondollar purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January In doing so the administration will begin honoring Davis promise to reveal the details after a period of six months or less The governor said disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down power costs But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from opengovernment advocates consumer activists Republican lawmakers and others GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits under the states Public Records Act seeking disclosure of details on about billion in emergency shortterm purchases and additional billions on less costly yearslong contracts A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the lawsuits today in San Diego On Thursday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on Californians to phone the governors office in protest The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is getting it said Harvey Rosenfield the groups director The governor wont let us look at them contracts to make sure they wont cause further rate hikes in future years Rosenfield said It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts he said We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions Administration officials dismissed critics assertions and said that full disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive marketing matter Officials acknowledged for the first time however that some of the states less costly longterm power contracts with generators contain secrecy clauses that may prevent public disclosure The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less expensive longterm power supplies that authorities worried little about the clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have the suppliers permission to divulge them Though violating the agreement could void the contracts industry representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts Suppliers might however sign no more contracts with the state the representatives said Apparently there are some contracts with that secrecy clause and our legal people are looking at it said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio I dont know what the end result is going to be but its the governors intent to release the contracts While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in longterm contracts they said disclosure of the initial shortterm purchases will soon begin Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of shortterm spotmarket buys made in midJanuary within the next two weeks on the Internet easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis fellow Democratic statewide elected officials State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state power bills in February during a dramatic thhour reversal under pressure from the Davis administration The controller who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administrations handling of the energy crisis indefinitely postponed plans to put information from electricitypurchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a news conference to announce the disclosures In March Attorney General Bill Lockyer representing Davis in this instance provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases Lockyers letter said the publics interest in maintaining confidentiality in matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure But Lockyer a former East Bay politician said last week he personally favors making public the details of the purchases In my mind at least and as a matter of philosophy the expenditures are so extraordinary the issues are so important that the contracts need to be made public he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of Information Coalition Opengovernment advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of Californians believe they are getting too little information about how state officials are responding to the power shortage and a whopping percent want details of longterm power purchasing contracts made public Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the states Open Government Act said Kent Pollock the coalitions executive director The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that shield information from public scrutiny,haedicke-m,Managing Director

Catch up on the latest in the energy industry at webinfostorensfProductsIssuesWatch DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD SCIENTECH IssueAlert October PGEs Rate Cap Proposal Leading the Charge for ReRegulation or Protecti ng Itself from Economic Disaster By Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDD Pacific Gas Electric Co PGE in filings with the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC and California Independent System Operator CalISO has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour In seeking the rate cap PGE is joined by Edison International the parent company of Southern California Edison and The Utility Action Network TURN a ratepayer advocacy group ANALYSIS The current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San Diego this summer As San Diego Gas Electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDGE customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns PGE customers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time PGE had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same PGE buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect PGE has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates In real terms PGE was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour In total PGE has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month This explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale rates in California However even though PGE as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company PGE Corpis still making money of f deregulation in California For instance PGEs Diablo Canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility In addit ion PGE Corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well And the unregulated National Energy Groupwhich operates in markets outside of California such as Massachusetts Rhode Island and New Hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r Thus it is important to note the distinction between PGE and its parent PGE Corp Ironically as a whole PGE Corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states PGE reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong This puts PGE in an awkward predicament On one hand PGE wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells On the other hand PGE is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power In fairness though the revenue PGE has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers PGEs rate freeze is scheduled to end March at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that PGEs stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place Due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that PGEs stranded costs are already paid off When this is officially determined by the CPUC PGE will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place The CPUC has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on Oct The core question of these proceedings will be whether or not PGE should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted PGE wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the CPUC determines that PGE had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as TURN will surely protest It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PGE that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices Typically TURN and PGE along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues However both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons TURN says that PGE and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers TURN continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to PGEs proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s Within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on PGEs motivations Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in California has become a failed experiment Many have surmised that PGE s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California to a regulated structure I think this is a misinterpretation PGE has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line PGEs efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return California to a regulated market Rather PGE is merel y attempting to protect its own interests The utility wants to secure temporary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and transfer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted A return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in PGEs best interests as it continues to sell power from its nuclear plant In addition PGE probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in California which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in California As we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power PGEs proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers A recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what PGE can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year It will be interesting to see if the CPUC has the same perception when it evaluates PGEs proposal later this
