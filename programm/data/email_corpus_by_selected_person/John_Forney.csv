OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions starting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the protocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the spirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC means run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to run by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding this issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we would receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someone else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like replacement responsive reserve and nonspinning Ercots interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations a group supposedly unconcerned with price If OOMC means to run then why would the protocols contemplate or need OOME They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME This is basically the disagreement This could very well be a issue for Frontera Why would anyone generate for and dump to the imbalance mkt at in hopes of filing for a breakeven Ridiculous I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had no comment on whether OOMC means to generate Mark Patterson now also has no comment Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs the imbalance price we will receive I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant in response to an OOMC until we receive an OOME instruction This has compelled Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us because they need to have us online to control local congestion Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect Section says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern or Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols The latter is in effect Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us or give us an OOME deployment unless we are already runnnig I think that this is a software issue not a protocol issue We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled Once we have been OOMCd we will start to gen Once we reach full load we will request an OOME If they dont comply we will shut down the unit Ercot said that it was entirely reasonable that we would request to be compensated in the form of an OOME The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every minutes Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis Finally I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices via OOME or force Ercot into a corner It just is not the right economic environment to generate for and sell for Further operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for forcing them to OOME our plant Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run If you agree with me what is our next step I need to move aggressively on this issue Thanks JForney ,forney-j,Manager

SeungTaek Olinde Jr Steve Subject FW Ercot Questions Please check out the following The agreement I reached with ErcotFrontera yesterday is as follows When we receive an OOMC we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down We dont actually want to do this as there are some expensive start charges associated with this We will discuss further in the meeting Thanks JMF Original Message From Forney John M Sent Wednesday November PM To Portz David Gilbertsmith Doug Subject Ercot Questions David I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation Frontera has been issued OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions starting September th This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion whether local or zonal The OOMC as I understand it reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price which currently is zero This is because the replacement reserve market is nonexistent An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week per Mark Patterson The second component of this option is OOME This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price as mentioned in the protocols So the OOMCOOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component I think that this is the spirit of the OOMs as mentioned in Section of the Protocols Here is the problem the head of Ercot Market Operations John Adams interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid We explained to them on numerous occasions that we dont believe OOMC means run If they wanted us to run then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run yes or no When instructed to run by Ercot we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc as we were previously under OOMC orders I sent at least three emails to my Ercot rep Mark Patterson regarding this issue I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercots intrepretation was correct For all of the times that we ran at their request we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price a penalty for Resource Imbalance For example in the early morning hours we would receive as little as for electricity that cost to generate Mark also mentioned that when they said run they expected us to sell to someone else or just generate into the imbalance Mark told me dont worry you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money Here is my view OOMC does not mean run It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls much like

John Please feel free to make any changes to the priorities below I should have covered most of the big items and even thought up a new enhancement ie UNDO key but feel free to add to this list I have not sent this to Madup Kumar yet so just delete this message and forward to him I hope this isnt too harsh towards Sasha but I wanted to get the point across regarding the PS message at the bottom I really hope that they can complete these changes It would make life much easier Joe Capasso Madup In reference to Eterra I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy When using Eterra some tasks are difficult to complete and can result in mismatches in the Ercot Portal I will identify some of the difficult tasks and I will make some suggestions on enhancements In addition I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel I will categorize the list based on Priority Priority Very important and needs to be completed immediately Priority Important and needs to be completed within the next days Priority Moderate importance easy tasks can be completed at programmers convenience Priority A Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Counterparty A in the South Zone and a Sell to Counterparty B in the North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Counterparty A South Zone to the Hourly Ercot Book and a second trade a sell from the Hourly Ercot Book to Counterparty B I realize that we have a problem with the transmission between the North and South Zones and that is what makes this a difficult enhancement PriorityB Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera and a sell to Frontera This is not very intuitive and causes some confusion Why cant we input a buy from Frontera just as we would with any other trade It could be as simple as clicking a box to indicate that Frontera ie EPMI should be adjusted on the resource side and not EPMI on the obligation side PriorityC Eterra should not write over any trades that were input manually into the Ercot Portal Is there any way that we can make it identify a trade that was input manually into the portal When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade PriorityA Undo Button On various occasions we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOSErcot Portal and it was not the result that we had expected Therefore the trader has to manually change each of the trades This can be a very time consuming process Is there a way to have an UNDO button similar to the Excel UNDO key to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal PriorityB Change the short name in internal counterparty external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Reason It is just difficult to read I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix but it is still not done ProirityA Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal for example elpasomeren is converted into APX But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also PriorityB Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date This is one less step that we need to worry about The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS Ercot Portal In addition it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs If you need additional clarification on any of these topics I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further I will be working days on Monday Nov th Thursday Nov th Thanks Joe Capasso PS Below

accept single entry trades such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine South Zone and a Sell to FPL North Zone Currently this has to be done by entering two trades a purchase from Calpine South Zone to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book to FPL North Zone Sasha said he is working on this but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that it is a purchase from Frontera Essentially this would increase the EPMI mws in the Ercot Portal Change the short name in internal counterpary external counterparty to the actual long name ie elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE ie El Paso Merchant is actually APX So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date One less step that we need to worry about I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading time is of the essence and that we dont have much time to input data Therefore we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly I realize that the first two items will take some time but the last items should be quick fixes I hope this helps Joe Capasso,forney-j,Manager

that since they didnt enter any contest They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check The jackass scam artist called them back bitching that they had cancelled their check My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN He tried to reinstate the check but the banks policy prevented him from reactivating this payment He was going to do this again but I told his inlaws friends and everyone else I could to talk to him He finally saw the light Just doing my job Anyway this

Haddock Pat Martell Miller Jeffrey Subject Possible Scam Not sure if you knew of this or not DONT EVER DIAL AREA CODE This one is being distributed all over the US This is pretty scary especially given the way they try to get you to call Be sure you read this and pass it on to all your friends family and business associates so they dont get scammed THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM Dont respond to EMails phone calls or web pages which tell you to call an phone number This is a very important issue of Scam Busters because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading extremely quickly This can easily cost you or more and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it Wed like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to our attention This scam has also been identified by the National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims a lot of money There are lots of different permutations of this scam but HERES HOW IT WORKS You will receive a message on your answering machine voice mail etc asking you to call a number beginning with the area code The reasons you are asked to call varies It can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill to tell you someone you know has been arrested died to let you know you have won a wonderful prize etc In each case you are told to call the number right away Since there are so many new area codes these days people unknowingly return these calls If you call from the US you will apparently be charged per minute Or you will get a long recorded message The point is they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges Unfortunately when you get your phone bill youll often be charged more than WHY IT WORKS The area code number is located in the British Virgin Islands The Bahamas The area code can be used as a paypercall number similar to numbers in the US Since is not in the US it is not covered by US regulations of numbers which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a paypercall number There is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged Furthermore whereas many US phones have number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges number blocking will not prevent calls to the area code We recommend that no matter how you get the message if you are asked to call a number with an area code that you dont recognize andorinvestigate further and just disregard the message Be wary of EMail or calls asking you to call an area code num ber Its important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare Thats because you did actually make the call If you complain both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved They will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company Youll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong Please forward this entire message to all of your friends family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam Do You Yahoo Get email alerts NEW webcam

reasonable Be ready to document opportunity costs in the NW and the SW If you have questions as to what is just and reasonable give me Bill Steve Hall or Tim B a call Note the penalties mentioned in and We will not dec load until futher notice as we dont have the telemetry to accurately measure whether we are long or short in any given instance Our company preschedules an amount of energy necessary to cover forecasted load If this load is higher we will be subject to the penalties listed below The Real Time group will not expose company to any such charges See There are Services

Emergency Tariff Modifications Tariff Amendment On Friday about pm the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes some of which are effective as of December beginning HE and others that take effect Tuesday December As a consequence we no longer have the luxury of waiting until Jan to start documenting certain costs we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the soft cap immediately I understand that at least some of the traders have been informed of these changes but I thought that it might be helpful for everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing The ISO has changed the hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap Its similar to the FERCs proposed soft cap in its Nov Order Sellers can bid over for supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids If the ISO accepts a bid greater than settlement will be asbid and subject to refund if costs cannot be verified SCs must submit cost documentation to the FERC ISO and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy dispatched in excess of the soft cap Effective December Beginning Trade Day December the ISO is going to charge SCs who underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time based on each SCs net regional negative uninstructed deviations Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations is a new ISO defined term see below These SCs will be charged for amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy from bids above the price cap and costs for Energy associated with outofmarket Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to respond The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the ISO advance notice of a derate or outage that would limit the Generators ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction If the outage or derate occurs in realtime then a reason code provided with a decline or partial acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will be assessed subject to some additional conditions If the ISO has to curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency the Generator will pay an additional penalty of MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver Bilateral arrangements with the ISO ie out of market purchases will not be altered by the ISOs Amendment From December the ISO paid an average of million per day for real time energy On December th the ISO paid million and on December th million The published ex post price will not exceed There is still a hard cap of on Ancillary Services capacity bids Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations Penalties for being short in realtime either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward markets that does not show up are based on net deviations for each BEEP interval based on an SCs entire portfolio including Load Generation Imports and Exports Action We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately Much of the groundwork for figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the realtime and services desks but we need to make sure that someone is collecting this information on a daily basis For now I am willing to be the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the appropriate

dec load until futher notice as we dont have the telemetry to accurately measure whether we are long or short in any given instance Our company preschedules an amount of energy necessary to cover forecasted load If this load is higher we will be subject to the penalties listed below The Real Time group will not expose company to any such charges See There are Services related penalties for all

costly disagreement JMF Forwarded by John M ForneyHOUECT on AM Steve C Hall PM To Tim CT Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT John M CT Greg CT Mary CT Elizabeth CT cc Subject ISO Emergency Tariff Modifications Tariff Amendment On Friday about pm the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes some of which are effective as of December beginning HE and others that take effect Tuesday December As a consequence we no longer have the luxury of waiting until Jan to start documenting certain costs we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the soft cap immediately I understand that at least some of the traders have been informed of these changes but I thought that it might be helpful for everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing The ISO has changed the hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap Its similar to the FERCs proposed soft cap in its Nov Order Sellers can bid over for supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids If the ISO accepts a bid greater than settlement will be asbid and subject to refund if costs cannot be verified SCs must submit cost documentation to the FERC ISO and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy dispatched in excess of the soft cap Effective December Beginning Trade Day December the ISO is going to charge SCs who underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time based on each SCs net regional negative uninstructed deviations Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations is a new ISO defined term see below These SCs will be charged for amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy from bids above the price cap and costs for Energy associated with outofmarket Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to respond The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the ISO advance notice of a derate or outage that would limit the Generators ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction If the outage or derate occurs in realtime then a reason code provided with a decline or partial acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will be assessed subject to some additional conditions If the ISO has to curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency the Generator will pay an additional penalty of MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver Bilateral arrangements with the ISO ie out of market purchases will not be altered by the ISOs Amendment From December the ISO paid an average of million per day for real time energy On December th the ISO paid million and on December th million The published ex post price will not exceed There is still a hard cap of on Ancillary Services capacity bids Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations Penalties for being short in realtime either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward markets that does not show up are based on net deviations for each BEEP interval based on an SCs entire portfolio including Load Generation Imports and Exports Action We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and Ancillary Services Energy bids

Tuesday December As a consequence we no longer have the luxury of waiting until Jan to start documenting certain costs we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the soft cap immediately I understand that at least some of the traders have been informed of these changes but I thought that it might be helpful for everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing The ISO has changed the hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap Its similar to the FERCs proposed soft cap in its Nov Order Sellers can bid over for supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids If the ISO accepts a bid greater than settlement will be asbid and subject to refund if costs cannot be verified SCs must submit cost documentation to the FERC ISO and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy dispatched in excess of the soft cap Effective December Beginning Trade Day December the ISO is going to charge SCs who underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time based on each SCs net regional negative uninstructed deviations Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations is a new ISO defined term see below These SCs will be charged for amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy from bids above the price cap and costs for Energy associated with outofmarket Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to respond The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the ISO advance notice of a derate or outage that would limit the Generators ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction If the outage or derate occurs in realtime then a reason code provided with a decline or partial acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will be assessed subject to some additional conditions If the ISO has to curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency the Generator will pay an additional penalty of MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver Bilateral arrangements with the ISO ie out of market purchases will not be altered by the ISOs Amendment From December the ISO paid an average of million per day for real time energy On December th the ISO paid million and on December th million The published ex post price will not exceed There is still a hard cap of on Ancillary Services capacity bids Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations Penalties for being short in realtime either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward markets that
