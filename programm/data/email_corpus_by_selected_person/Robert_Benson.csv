expectation of The energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasnt grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size In other words margins may decline but since revenues are so much higher earnings still go up Illustrating this firstquarter EPS of cents was ahead of the yearago figure even
