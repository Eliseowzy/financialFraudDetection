Larry,Campbell,<16837187.1075860881972.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,larry.campbell@enron.com,2001-07-31 08:27:11,Kevin as promised attached is the information that was found by David Roensch on environemntal perspectives in the Flagstaff area Forwarded by Larry CampbellETSEnron on AM From David Roensch PM To Larry CampbellET nron John ShaferOTSEnron cc Subject Larry per our phone conversation tonight I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them

permit and the EPA permits for and Briefly here they are First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l technology just to be sure that they stay under the ton limit I know time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations and but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lbhr or tonyr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK ppm vd for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of the manufactures numbers are ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we stated that we would be operating at low loads for of the time and we applied a safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented this in lbhr and tonsyr This would have covered us but because the permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us ppmvd during low temps and low loads with with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou ld bring this before his management Ill keep you apprised of this issue

keep Jerry D Martin in the loop on progress with the permits Thanks John Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tue PM To Jensen Ruth Cc Kendrick William Shafer John Subject RE Staions and air permit comments to EPA this is what Im trying for The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of emissions just ppmvd We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons rates of tyr in the application but the EPA came back with NSPS limits which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than We c an either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtion s just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas or we can spend some valuabl e time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations in lbhr or tyr Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer He is ch ecking with his management on this issue Ill keep you apprised From Ruth nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc William nronXgate Subject RE Staions and air permit commen ts to EPA I agree with your comments Cant we get a lbhr limit based on the netting calculations that we can live with Were only required to hav e a ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements and that value would be a lot greater than ppmv Ruth Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tuesday October PM To Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Staions and air permit comments t o EPA Jon and Ruth presented below are the comments to the air perimts at and Please review for clairty and content I have spoken to Roger Ko hn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No He is checking on what the EPA can do about this I have spoken to Arno ld Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict ppmvd requriement for NO x and CO and he has said that we can hold to the ppm value by doing some major gas recycling This is a fuel waste and costly Anyway depen ding upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the ppmvd or hold out for ppmvd Id like your comments asap The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to ppmv at O based on a hour average except during periods of startup and shutdown At F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions However GE data indicates that NOx and C O may be as high as ppmv during lowload conditions of and lower The permit application represented turbine op erations at base load of the time with reduced load operations load occurring no more than of the time The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lbhr and tonyr These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis and took were taken into account by the EPA See EPA Statement of Basis document Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lbyr or tonyear values Transwestern is concerned tha t under low load conditions of less than the emissions of NOx and CO would be ppmvd Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that emissions of NOx and CO be held to ppmvd during the of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to The word Catepillar is mispelled throughout the p ermit Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel ga s requires Transwestern to use methodologies wet chemistry technology that are not normally used to monitor and measure sulfu r in the natural gas Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring

application February of this year to ensu re that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona When I told them that we would need the permits by the end of September each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem in light of the fact that energy issues related to California were to be given top priority On a monthly basis I phoned the permit engineer assigned to each application to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns In all monthly calls both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and no delays were expected As we approached the anticipated September issuance date calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was first informed of the month additional time beyond the September issuan ce which would be required for the permit issuance In light of this issue we in ETS might want to use this as a training exercise and develop a protocol that the other DESs should apply to stay o n track with the permit progress for construction projects From John nronXgate on PM CDT To Phil nronXgate Jerry D nronXgate cc Louis nronXgate William nronXgate Larr y CampbellET NRON Ruth nronXgate Richard nronXgate Subject RE Red Rock Air Permits Heads up Phil I agree with your assessment but would offer some additional information After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some strategic ideas that will increase theprobability that this type of circumstance will not occur in the future I will be glad to discuss any of this with you on Monday morning John Shafer Original Message From Lowry Phil Sent Sun AM To Martin Jerry D Cc Shafer John Subject Red Rock Air Permits Heads up At Stans staff meeting last week the discovery of a delay in the issua nce of Air Permits was discussed Stan indicated that this was unacceptable I requested that you conduct a meeting that afternoon with key people to outline a plan of attack to get the permit schedule back on track I am aware that you did such and you provided a voice mail update that indicated a plan Here is the problem Apparently the matter was further discussed at the weekly Red Rock status meeting on Friday and the following feedback was provided by a little birdie We can expect another unpleasant d iscussion at Mondays am meeting with Stan Joe Hartsoe has been unable to pursue any discussion with Washington officials to put pressure on Arizona WTC attacks Operations is unwilling to put much pressure on ArizonaEPA out of concer n for future responsiveness from the agency Re Sun Devil Sun Devil is a bird in the bush and Red Rock is a bird in the hand There is no way that we can get the Red Rock project completed as promise d because we waited until it was too late to find out what was going on with the Air Permits The agency will not allow a bifurcation of the project and let us proceed with on site construction prior to a permit and delay delivery of the compressor to the site We havent yet had

Mexico showed up at my office this morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our CS south of Roswell I felt the need to tag along with them Heres the way it is The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act ESA This is not a new issue with the EPA Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for CS and The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed I told the engineer that becasue CS and are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA As you remember the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue He advised me not to do this I think his decision had something to do with the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly delay issuance of the permits Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA From Donna nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc Subject FW question on Transwestern Larry Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting a TE survey at Stations prior to issuing air permits Dont know if you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process but Steve Burns sent the following message to me which I thought I

From Burns Stephen Sent Monday July AM To Martens Donna Cc Fritch Bret Gutierrez Cecil Bagot Nancy Westbrook Roger Robertson Linda Nord Sue Subject RE question on Transwestern Thanks Donna The reason I ask is that weve been fighting a long politicalpolicy issue here in Washington on rightsofway across federal lands Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications EBS and fiber optic cables The agencies weve been pitted against are the BLM and Forest Service and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of companies The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables theyll also do to pipelines Two weeks ago I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this issue El Paso pipelines told me theyve had a tough time getting compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion into California My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rightsofway and you think you might need some help please feel free to let me know We meet regularly with Dept of Agriculture senior staff and should soon meet with the new Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth We could help if you have any problems Cant help you with the Navajo Nation though But seriously wed always like to learn if you

perspectives in the Flagstaff area Forwarded by Larry CampbellETSEnron on AM From David Roensch PM To Larry CampbellET nron John ShaferOTSEnron cc Subject Larry per our phone conversation tonight I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them

indicated that the June target date for in service is on schedule There will be mainline separators for each mainline system PGE is also on schedule for June pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the gallon tank at the separator installation site This is a PGE issue and will not create a delay of the inservice date All other permits and approvals according to PGE are in place PGE has stated that after operation of the separators they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ETS Post construction of the separators will result in ft joints of in pipe PGE will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PGE will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PGE has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP kettleman CS latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley CS Line is a in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PGEs biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCBs Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PGE system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PGE to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PGE will continue to sample each location once every two weeks Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap FilterSeparators Originally locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority sites The determination of a Priority site is based upon the following criteria a location where liquids were collected twice and ppm concentration of the liquids collected was ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is mmscfday Samples collected at this location have shown PCBs in the range of ppm PGEs agreement with SoCal at this location is ppm PCBs in the liquid phase PGE has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PGE and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PGE has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCBs at their interconnect locations Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap FilterSeparators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PGE passed out a booklet pertaining to small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for sites with backup to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume FS up to the indicated at the last meeting is to million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PGE presented One PGE customer a cement plant has inquired about PGE deconning portions of their plant that has PCBs PGE is in discussions with the cement company PGE has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a project Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PGE CS to study lube oil systems There are compressors at the Topock and Hinkley CSs Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PGE is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to mmscfday cap by May Over time PGE will look into their CS configurations to handle the increased gas flows to mm scfday Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July as some of the PGE meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on other business,campbell-l,Employee

Team LagunaET nron Ted NRON Subject Meeting with the Lagunas over the PCB remediation at CS I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo the PEOP a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the pueblos in New Mexico ranging from UST to superfund and members of ETS members of the Laguna team Butch Russell Rick Smith advisor for the Laguna team myself and George Robinson This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo The meeting centered around two issues at the site the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity With respect to the first concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis and send the results to POEP for review With repsect to the PCB remediation issue things were a little different The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this They indicated that that have been patient with Transwsterns attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination but based upon the historic sampling results that this technology is not proving to be very successful in fact the results have shown stagnant results Im using their words They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site Members of the Laguna pueblo who work for the POEP expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a cancer with potential to spread A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University Energy and Environmental Research Center who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done At the conclusion of the meeting I informed the POEP that Transwesterns internal remediation group would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions This seemed to satisify the POEP and they were content with this John I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue A couple of things I want to bring out First we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future Second on the Laguna tribal lands they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem Although we are considered by the POEP as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with direct quote from the POEP they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from Transwestern to clean up the PCBs Please get back with me on this,campbell-l,Employee

Hoover and Keith out of Houston Tx I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two CS on state lands Ive dealt with these individuals before but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that After that meeting I will decide who should do the applications I have calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands Pending the outcome of each meeting I will decide who to use Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits and they would probably be my first choice I am keeping Mr Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units which will be permitted for a six month period there will still be an overall major emissions decrease After the six month period the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again Also my intent is to permit these turbines at ppm NOx as opposed to the lower ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system If this was a new station I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the number but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine this should be easy to do The differrence in emission between and is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the ppm number that Rolls says they can do but has had trouble reaching One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations By permitting at ppm this will greatly help this Ill share the emissions numbers with you when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F document for the FERC submittal and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation the F report will be completed by March Is there something Ive missed William

The other has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation just foot and vehicle traffic I dont have problem with saying the above but keep in mind the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine It has always been Transweterns policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value scenery wildlife etc I dont have a problem with including resource reports and for vegetation and soils I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats In addition the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore would not be an issue of habitat loss There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area I seriously doubt it Again TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose In Arizona we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City ie Flagstaff for station construction or from a drinking well source In any event we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe If we need to discuss the above give me a call Hackett Terry NSRcom on PM To cc Subject Station Concerns Larry I gave the tree issue at Station some thought and I have a couple of concerns regarding the environmental report The report is being written based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard and on previously disturbed ground If we impact areas even within existing facilities that were not previously disturbed we are required to include environmental data about those areas So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been previously disturbed To help determine this I downloaded a USGS aerial of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the station yard look to be the same agesize as those surrounding the station This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees have not been previously disturbed A copy of the aerial is attached However it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial construction and the trees simply grew back Unfortunately I dont have that information and dont know if you do either And let me point out that my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct but the amount of information supplied in the report I want to feel comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC For this project that would primarily include a description of the existing vegetation and soils resource report and All we would really need is a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils and how much will be permanently impacted etc However we did not budget any time to obtain this information nor did we anticipate the need for site visits My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously disturbed or not If not I hope to come up with some verbiage that everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements Otherwise we will have to obtain the necessary information and thats beyond our initial scope If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects that may provide enough information Again it only needs to be brief Also we need to verify for the other stations that we are constructing in previously disturbed areas Lastly Arnold has indicated that the hydrotest water will come from existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under Transwesterns blanket permit Please verifyand I think we should provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing After you have had a chance to think about this please call and we can discuss Terry Station aerialjpg The

becomes a routene activity for us and PGE we might want to consider breaking in a company that is less expensive can more quickly mobilize and get the same quality work product Vector has to travel from Ohio Deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else Tiny do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PGE As you know they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA but with the new PCB rules in place a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities How do you think PGE will respond to us possibly using another contractor other than Vector for the work I suppose we can bring this issue up in Flagstaff Mums the word on the PCB modeling issue John Thanks for your

Rescheduled for July th Larry Good thoughts I believe Rod Boschee told me he was putting the same thoughts on the agenda which cover your items However I will take a close look at his draft agenda and make certain that the equivalent thoughts are on there Now about item and your closing paragraph Item No I do not want to open the issue of the PCB Model to PGE at this time Maybe later but not now As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph Randy Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators deconned We took great pains last fall when we had the separators down to test and decon them so we could establish a base line Why would we take the system down and change the filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility If we did that then hypothetically next fall when we took the system down and changed the filters if we took any wipe samples it could contain residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past twelve months It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up Im open to further argument on it but that is the way Randy and I see it at this point in time On the subject of the selection of the contractor Randy and I believe that you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best job and is most dependable Remember that PGE had confidence in Vector at least that is what I recall from last fall So if we go with a new consultant will PGE have the same confidence Also you and Tiny must make certain that the firm we use has some acceptable credentials What PCB issues have they handled in the past etc I will be glad to discuss any of this with you or Tiny as needed Thanks John Shafer Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tuesday July PM To Shafer John Subject RE Flagstaff Trip Rescheduled for July th John some quick thoughts on agenda

attitudes about potential PCB introduced into their equipment Any new customers with positive hits of PCBs Internal sampling activities How far have PCBs spread into the PGE system wipe tests results versus liquids collections A map would be nice depicting this Transwestern continues to be pretty much dry on mainline and extremely dry on the Topock lateral Maybe we should have a little presentation showing liquids collected in the last year on the mainline and Topock lateral Our commitment to keeping the PCBs as immobile as possible We might consider sharing what weve learned from our PCB modeling study with Penn State and what our future plans are Another Tranwestern effort to show our commitment John if we plan on opening up our separator has a decision been made to decon it or just clean out the hydrocarbon buildup and replace the filters If we do decide to decon our separator and or theirs we will need to line out a contractor to be onsite when we blow down the systems Id like to discuss possibly not using Vector for this type of routene activity any longer There is a company in Farmington NM Riley that can probably do the job As you know this decon work is not

perspectives in the Flagstaff area Forwarded by Larry CampbellETSEnron on AM From David Roensch PM To Larry CampbellET nron John ShaferOTSEnron cc Subject Larry per our phone conversation tonight I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them

diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company NWNG a local distribution company LDC with its corporate headquarters located in Portand Oregon This due diligence which was conducted on August was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue A relative risk number between and has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact A rating of indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair remediate or formally close each issue Presented below by discipline are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records documents and discussions with NWNG personnel Therefore this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented General Pipeline Characteristics This is a dry pipeline system No pipeline liquids are generated only small volumes of compressor oils are collected All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system There is still approx miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage and underground injection and storage reservoir bcf storage capacity this is a non Title V major source NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity NWNG is planning a mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas Environmental Procedures Manual The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with The manual addressed waste management permitting disposal and environmetal stewardship There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNGs commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG Risk Cost Notices of Violation NOVNotices of Noncompliance NON In a summary page provided by NWNG a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available Although the company had received a few notices they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues There were no outstanding judgements NOVs NONs or pending agency actions or issues to be resoved Risk Cost PCBs In interviews with NWNG they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system was unknown Risk Cost Mercury Mercury was used on the NWNG system but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in to remove mercury manometers An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used Risk Cost Onsite Disposal Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants in interviews with NWNGs environmental management they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous toxic or non hazardous waste Risk Cost undefined Hazardous Waste There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste Risk Cost NORMS The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials NORMS are not a problem in the pipeline system Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest Pipeline Company Risk Cost Underground Storage Tanks UST There is only one regulated underground storage tank UST remaining on the NWNG system Albany and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring testing and recordkeeping All other underground tanks have been removed At one of the tank removal sites there exists an active remediation in progress Closure of this site is expected in the near future Risk Cost LNG plants In interviews with NWNG environmental management there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas LNG plants The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant Linnton site which underlies the LNG plant This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plants NWNG owned and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks Eugene Water and Electrical Board The City of Eugene has determined that a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of The Eugene Water and Electrical Board EWEB which is the regulatory agency in Eugene has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately of which the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of to be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene The environmental management of NWNG has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG offer of approximately Risk Cost Salem Site According to NWNG management this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plant This site which ceased operation in the early s was dismantled and abandoned From the time the facility ceased operations untill the present a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park The site is immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River a major perennial watercourse in Oregon There have been no soil groundwater or river river sediment studies completed to determine potential environmental impacts NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of London The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site Risks Costs Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor on the Wilammette River has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site This superfund site extends for a distance of miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites originally owned by NWNG The EPA has designated approximately primary responsible parties which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination Linnton MGPWacker Site The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site has acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Linnton facility which originally included the Wacker Site initiated operation in and ceased operation in During the operation of the facility operation various organic coal tar wastes comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids LNAPLs and dense non aqueous phase liquids DNAPLs were generated Characteristically these waste products include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs BTEX and cyanide During the early stages of facility operation these wastes were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River and then later in unlined ponds were constructed at the facility Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette River were in excess of million gallons or cubic yards It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar ponds Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to or more years NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNGs portion of this superfund responsibility The policies were not availble during the due diligence to verify or confirm the amount of coverage Additionally because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated It should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known adequate insurance coverage appears to be somewhat premature Risk Cost ,campbell-l,Employee

Mexico showed up at my office this morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our CS south of Roswell I felt the need to tag along with them Heres the way it is The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act ESA This is not a new issue with the EPA Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for CS and The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed I told the engineer that becasue CS and are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA As you remember the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue He advised me not to do this I think his decision had something to do with the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly delay issuance of the permits Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA From Donna nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc Subject FW question on Transwestern Larry Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting a TE survey at Stations prior to issuing air permits Dont know if you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process but Steve Burns sent the following message to me which I thought I

From Burns Stephen Sent Monday July AM To Martens Donna Cc Fritch Bret Gutierrez Cecil Bagot Nancy Westbrook Roger Robertson Linda Nord Sue Subject RE question on Transwestern Thanks Donna The reason I ask is that weve been fighting a long politicalpolicy issue here in Washington on rightsofway across federal lands Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications EBS and fiber optic cables The agencies weve been pitted against are the BLM and Forest Service and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of companies The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables theyll also do to pipelines Two weeks ago I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this issue El Paso pipelines told me theyve had a tough time getting compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion into California My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rightsofway and you think you might need some help please feel free to let me know We meet regularly with Dept of Agriculture senior staff and should soon meet with the new Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth We could help if you have any problems Cant help you with the Navajo Nation though But seriously wed always like to learn if you

permit and the EPA permits for and Briefly here they are First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l technology just to be sure that they stay under the ton limit I know time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations and but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lbhr or tonyr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK ppm vd for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of the manufactures numbers are ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we stated that we would be operating at low loads for of the time and we applied a safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented this in lbhr and tonsyr This would have covered us but because the permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us ppmvd during low temps and low loads with with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou ld bring this before his management Ill keep you apprised of this issue

permit comments to EPA this is what Im trying for The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of emissions just ppmvd We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons rates of tyr in the application but the EPA came back with NSPS limits which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than We c an either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtion s just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas or we can spend some valuabl e time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations in lbhr or tyr Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer He is ch ecking with his management on this issue Ill keep you apprised From Ruth nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc William nronXgate Subject RE Staions and air permit commen ts to EPA I agree with your comments Cant we get a lbhr limit based on the netting calculations that we can live with Were only required to hav e a ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements and that value would be a lot greater than ppmv Ruth Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tuesday October PM To Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Staions and air permit comments t o EPA Jon and Ruth presented below are the comments to the air perimts at and Please review for clairty and content I have spoken to Roger Ko hn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No He is checking on what the EPA can do about this I have spoken to Arno ld Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict ppmvd requriement for NO x and CO and he has said that we can hold to the ppm value by doing some major gas recycling This is a fuel waste and costly Anyway depen ding upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the ppmvd or hold out for ppmvd Id like your comments asap The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to ppmv at O based on a hour average except during periods of startup and shutdown At F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions However GE data indicates that NOx and C O may be as high as ppmv during lowload conditions of and lower The permit application represented turbine op erations at base load of the time with reduced load operations load occurring no more than of the time The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lbhr and tonyr These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis and took were taken into account by the EPA See EPA Statement of Basis document Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lbyr or tonyear values Transwestern is concerned tha t under low load conditions of less than the emissions of NOx and CO would be ppmvd Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that emissions of NOx and CO be held to ppmvd during the of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to The word Catepillar is mispelled throughout the p ermit Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel ga s requires Transwestern to use

Robinson This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo The meeting centered around two issues at the site the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity With respect to the first concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis and send the results to POEP for review With repsect to the PCB remediation issue things were a little different The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this They indicated that that have been patient with Transwsterns attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination but based upon the historic sampling results that this technology is not proving to be very successful in fact the results have shown stagnant results Im using their words They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site Members of the Laguna pueblo who work for the POEP expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a cancer with potential to spread A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University Energy and Environmental Research Center who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive

indicated that the June target date for in service is on schedule There will be mainline separators for each mainline system PGE is also on schedule for June pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the gallon tank at the separator installation site This is a PGE issue and will not create a delay of the inservice date All other permits and approvals according to PGE are in place PGE has stated that after operation of the separators they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ETS Post construction of the separators will result in ft joints of in pipe PGE will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PGE will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PGE has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP kettleman CS latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley CS Line is a in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PGEs biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCBs Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PGE system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PGE to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PGE will continue to sample each location once every two weeks Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap FilterSeparators Originally locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority sites The determination of a Priority site is based upon the following criteria a location where liquids were collected twice and ppm concentration of the liquids collected was ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is mmscfday Samples collected at this location have shown PCBs in the range of ppm PGEs agreement with SoCal at this location is ppm PCBs in the liquid phase PGE has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PGE and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PGE has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCBs at their interconnect locations Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap FilterSeparators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PGE passed out a booklet pertaining to small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for sites with backup to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume FS up to the indicated at the last meeting is to million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PGE presented One PGE customer a cement plant has inquired about PGE deconning portions of their plant that has PCBs PGE is in discussions with the cement company PGE has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a project Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PGE CS to study lube oil systems There are compressors at the Topock and Hinkley CSs Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PGE is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to mmscfday cap by May Over time PGE will look into their CS configurations to handle the increased gas flows to mm scfday Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July as some of the PGE meeting attendees will be in

technical issues for all of the pueblos in New Mexico ranging from UST to superfund and members of ETS members of the Laguna team Butch Russell Rick Smith advisor for the Laguna team myself and George Robinson This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo The meeting centered around two issues at the site the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity With respect to the first concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis and send the results to POEP for review With repsect to the PCB remediation issue things were a little different The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this They indicated that that have been patient with Transwsterns attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination but based upon the historic sampling results that this technology is not proving to be very successful in fact the results have shown stagnant results Im using their words They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site Members of the Laguna pueblo who work for the POEP expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a cancer with potential to spread A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University Energy and Environmental Research Center who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done At the conclusion of the meeting I informed the POEP that Transwesterns internal remediation group would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions This seemed to satisify the POEP and they were content

The other has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation just foot and vehicle traffic I dont have problem with saying the above but keep in mind the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine It has always been Transweterns policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value scenery wildlife etc I dont have a problem with including resource reports and for vegetation and soils I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats In addition the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore would not be an issue of habitat loss There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area I seriously doubt it Again TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose In Arizona we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City ie Flagstaff for station construction or from a drinking well source In any event we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe If we need to discuss the above give me a call Hackett Terry NSRcom on PM To cc Subject Station Concerns Larry I gave the tree issue at Station some thought and I have a couple of concerns regarding the environmental report The report is being written based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard and on previously disturbed ground If we impact areas even within existing facilities that were not previously disturbed we are required to include environmental data about those areas So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been previously disturbed To help determine this I downloaded a USGS aerial of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the station yard look to be the same agesize as those surrounding the station This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees have not been previously disturbed A copy of the aerial is attached However it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial construction and the trees simply grew back Unfortunately I dont have that information and dont know if you do either And let me point out that my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct but the amount of information supplied in the report I want to feel comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC For this project that would primarily include a description of the existing vegetation and soils resource report and All we would really need is a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils and how much will be permanently impacted etc However we did not budget any time to obtain this information nor did we anticipate the need for site visits My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously disturbed or not If not I hope to come up with some verbiage that everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements Otherwise we will have to obtain the necessary information and thats beyond our initial scope If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects that may provide enough information Again it only needs to be brief Also we need to verify for the other stations that we are constructing in previously disturbed areas Lastly Arnold has indicated that the hydrotest water will come from existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under Transwesterns blanket permit Please verifyand I think we should provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing After you have had a chance to think about this please call and we can discuss Terry Station aerialjpg The

perspectives in the Flagstaff area Forwarded by Larry CampbellETSEnron on AM From David Roensch PM To Larry CampbellET nron John ShaferOTSEnron cc Subject Larry per our phone conversation tonight I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them

diligence was completed of the assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company NWNG a local distribution company LDC with its corporate headquarters located in Portand Oregon This due diligence which was conducted on August was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures which may be associated with NWNG and identify and evaluate the environmental risks associated with each issue A relative risk number between and has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential risk impact A rating of indicates that there is no risk associated with this regulation or issue and a rating of indicates a major problem or an issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure An approximate cost value has also been assigned to each discipline It is to be understood and explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost conservative estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair remediate or formally close each issue Presented below by discipline are the environmental activities which impact and affect NWNG The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is based upon the availability of records documents and discussions with NWNG personnel Therefore this summary report is limited to the availability of information presented General Pipeline Characteristics This is a dry pipeline system No pipeline liquids are generated only small volumes of compressor oils are collected All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system There is still approx miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage and underground injection and storage reservoir bcf storage capacity this is a non Title V major source NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their underground storage capacity NWNG is planning a mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the agencies Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern NWNG has completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas Environmental Procedures Manual The NWNG environmental procedures manual appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format The topics covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company appeared to be involved with The manual addressed waste management permitting disposal and environmetal stewardship There was also a written statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNGs commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG Risk Cost Notices of Violation NOVNotices of Noncompliance NON In a summary page provided by NWNG a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available Although the company had received a few notices they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues There were no outstanding judgements NOVs NONs or pending agency actions or issues to be resoved Risk Cost PCBs In interviews with NWNG they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system was unknown Risk Cost Mercury Mercury was used on the NWNG system but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in to remove mercury manometers An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used Risk Cost Onsite Disposal Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants in interviews with NWNGs environmental management they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous toxic or non hazardous waste Risk Cost undefined Hazardous Waste There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste Risk Cost NORMS The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials NORMS are not a problem in the pipeline system Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest Pipeline Company Risk Cost Underground Storage Tanks UST There is only one regulated underground storage tank UST remaining on the NWNG system Albany and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring testing and recordkeeping All other underground tanks have been removed At one of the tank removal sites there exists an active remediation in progress Closure of this site is expected in the near future Risk Cost LNG plants In interviews with NWNG environmental management there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas LNG plants The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant Linnton site which underlies the LNG plant This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plants NWNG owned and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks Eugene Water and Electrical Board The City of Eugene has determined that a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of The Eugene Water and Electrical Board EWEB which is the regulatory agency in Eugene has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately of which the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of to be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene The environmental management of NWNG has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG offer of approximately Risk Cost Salem Site According to NWNG management this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plant This site which ceased operation in the early s was dismantled and abandoned From the time the facility ceased operations untill the present a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park The site is immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River a major perennial watercourse in Oregon There have been no soil groundwater or river river sediment studies completed to determine potential environmental impacts NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of London The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site Risks Costs Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor on the Wilammette River has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site This superfund site extends for a distance of miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites originally owned by NWNG The EPA has designated approximately primary responsible parties which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination Linnton MGPWacker Site The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site has acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Linnton facility which originally included the Wacker Site initiated operation in and ceased operation in During the operation of the facility operation various organic coal tar wastes comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids LNAPLs and dense non aqueous phase liquids DNAPLs were generated Characteristically these waste products include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs BTEX and cyanide During the early stages of facility operation these wastes were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River and then later in unlined ponds were constructed at the facility Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette River were in excess of million gallons or cubic yards It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar ponds Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to or more years NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNGs portion of this superfund responsibility The policies were not availble during the due diligence to verify or confirm the amount of coverage Additionally because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated It should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known adequate insurance coverage appears to be somewhat premature Risk Cost ,campbell-l,Employee

permit and the EPA permits for and Briefly here they are First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l technology just to be sure that they stay under the ton limit I know time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations and but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lbhr or tonyr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK ppm vd for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of the manufactures numbers are ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we stated that we would be operating at low loads for of the time and we applied a safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented this in lbhr and tonsyr This would have covered us but because the permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us ppmvd during low temps and low loads with with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou ld bring this before his management Ill keep you apprised of this issue

keep Jerry D Martin in the loop on progress with the permits Thanks John Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tue PM To Jensen Ruth Cc Kendrick William Shafer John Subject RE Staions and air permit comments to EPA this is what Im trying for The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of emissions just ppmvd We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons rates of tyr in the application but the EPA came back with NSPS limits which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than We c an either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtion s just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas or we can spend some valuabl e time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations in lbhr or tyr Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer He is ch ecking with his management on this issue Ill keep you apprised From Ruth nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc William nronXgate Subject RE Staions and air permit commen ts to EPA I agree with your comments Cant we get a lbhr limit based on the netting calculations that we can live with Were only required to hav e a ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements and that value would be a lot greater than ppmv Ruth Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tuesday October PM To Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Staions and air permit comments t o EPA Jon and Ruth presented below are the comments to the air perimts at and Please review for clairty and content I have spoken to Roger Ko hn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No He is checking on what the EPA can do about this I have spoken to Arno ld Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict ppmvd requriement for NO x and CO and he has said that we can hold to the ppm value by doing some major gas recycling This is a fuel waste and costly Anyway depen ding upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the ppmvd or hold out for ppmvd Id like your comments asap The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to ppmv at O based on a hour average except during periods of startup and shutdown At F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions However GE data indicates that NOx and C O may be as high as ppmv during lowload conditions of and lower The permit application represented turbine op erations at base load of the time with reduced load operations load occurring no more than of the time The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lbhr and tonyr These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis and took were taken into account by the EPA See EPA Statement of Basis document Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lbyr or tonyear values Transwestern is concerned tha t under low load conditions of less than the emissions of NOx and CO would be ppmvd Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that emissions of NOx and CO be held to ppmvd during the of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to The word Catepillar is mispelled throughout the p ermit Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel ga s requires Transwestern to use methodologies wet chemistry technology that are not normally used to monitor and measure sulfu r in the natural gas Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring

from Ohio Deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else Tiny do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PGE As you know they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA but with the new PCB rules in place a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities How do you think

make certain that the equivalent thoughts are on there Now about item and your closing paragraph Item No I do not want to open the issue of the PCB Model to PGE at this time Maybe later but not now As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph Randy Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators deconned We took great pains last fall when we had the separators down to test and decon them so we could establish a base line Why would we take the system down and change the filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility If we did that then hypothetically next fall when we took the system down and changed the filters if we took any wipe samples it could contain residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past twelve months It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up Im open to further argument on it but that is the way Randy and I see it at this point in time On the subject of the selection of the contractor Randy and I believe that you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best job and is most dependable Remember that PGE had confidence in Vector at least that is what I recall from last fall So if we go with a new consultant will PGE have the same confidence Also you and Tiny must make certain that the firm we use has some acceptable credentials What PCB issues have they handled in the past etc I will be glad to discuss any of this with

indicated that the June target date for in service is on schedule There will be mainline separators for each mainline system PGE is also on schedule for June pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the gallon tank at the separator installation site This is a PGE issue and will not create a delay of the inservice date All other permits and approvals according to PGE are in place PGE has stated that after operation of the separators they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ETS Post construction of the separators will result in ft joints of in pipe PGE will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PGE will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PGE has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP kettleman CS latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley CS Line is a in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PGEs biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCBs Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PGE system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PGE to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PGE will continue to sample each location once every two weeks Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap FilterSeparators Originally locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority sites The determination of a Priority site is based upon the following criteria a location where liquids were collected twice and ppm concentration of the liquids collected was ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is mmscfday Samples collected at this location have shown PCBs in the range of ppm PGEs agreement with SoCal at this location is ppm PCBs in the liquid phase PGE has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PGE and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PGE has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCBs at their interconnect locations Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap FilterSeparators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PGE passed out a booklet pertaining to small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for sites with backup to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume FS up to the indicated at the last meeting is to million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PGE presented One PGE customer a cement plant has inquired about PGE deconning portions of their plant that has PCBs PGE is in discussions with the cement company PGE has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a project Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PGE CS to study lube oil systems There are compressors at the Topock and Hinkley CSs Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PGE is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to mmscfday cap by May Over time PGE will look into their CS configurations to handle the increased gas flows to mm scfday Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July as some of the PGE meeting attendees will be in

application February of this year to ensu re that each application contained the correct and proper information required by the EPA and State of Arizona When I told them that we would need the permits by the end of September each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem in light of the fact that energy issues related to California were to be given top priority On a monthly basis I phoned the permit engineer assigned to each application to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns In all monthly calls both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and no delays were expected As we approached the anticipated September issuance date calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was first informed of the month additional time beyond the September issuan ce which would be required for the permit issuance In light of this issue we in ETS might want to use this as a training exercise and develop a

returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some

Hoover and Keith out of Houston Tx I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two CS on state lands Ive dealt with these individuals before but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that After that meeting I will decide who should do the applications I have calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands Pending the outcome of each meeting I will decide who to use Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits and they would probably be my first choice I am keeping Mr Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units which will be permitted for a six month period there will still be an overall major emissions decrease After the six month period the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again Also my intent is to permit these turbines at ppm NOx as opposed to the lower ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system If this was a new station I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the number but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine this should be easy to do The differrence in emission between and is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the ppm number that Rolls says they can do but has had trouble reaching One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations By permitting at ppm this will greatly help this Ill share the emissions numbers with you when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F document for the FERC submittal and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation the F report will be completed by March Is there something Ive missed William

permit and the EPA permits for and Briefly here they are First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l technology just to be sure that they stay under the ton limit I know time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations and but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lbhr or tonyr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK ppm vd for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of the manufactures numbers are ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we stated that we would be operating at low loads for of the time and we applied a safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented this in lbhr and tonsyr This would have covered us but because the permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us ppmvd during low temps and low loads with with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou ld bring this before his management Ill keep you apprised of this issue

keep Jerry D Martin in the loop on progress with the permits Thanks John Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tue PM To Jensen Ruth Cc Kendrick William Shafer John Subject RE Staions and air permit comments to EPA this is what Im trying for The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of emissions just ppmvd We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons rates of tyr in the application but the EPA came back with NSPS limits which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than We c an either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtion s just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas or we can spend some valuabl e time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations in lbhr or tyr Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer He is ch ecking with his management on this issue Ill keep you apprised From Ruth nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc William nronXgate Subject RE Staions and air permit commen ts to EPA I agree with your comments Cant we get a lbhr limit based on the netting calculations that we can live with Were only required to hav e a ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements and that value would be a lot greater than ppmv Ruth Original Message From Campbell Larry Sent Tuesday October PM To Jensen Ruth Kendrick William Subject Staions and air permit comments t o EPA Jon and Ruth presented below are the comments to the air perimts at and Please review for clairty and content I have spoken to Roger Ko hn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No He is checking on what the EPA can do about this I have spoken to Arno ld Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict ppmvd requriement for NO x and CO and he has said that we can hold to the ppm value by doing some major gas recycling This is a fuel waste and costly Anyway depen ding upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the ppmvd or hold out for ppmvd Id like your comments asap The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to ppmv at O based on a hour average except during periods of startup and shutdown At F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions However GE data indicates that NOx and C O may be as high as ppmv during lowload conditions of and lower The permit application represented turbine op erations at base load of the time with reduced load operations load occurring no more than of the time The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lbhr and tonyr These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis and took were taken into account by the EPA See EPA Statement of Basis document Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lbyr or tonyear values Transwestern is concerned tha t under low load conditions of less than the emissions of NOx and CO would be ppmvd Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that emissions of NOx and CO be held to ppmvd during the of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to The word Catepillar is mispelled throughout the p ermit Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel ga s requires Transwestern to use methodologies wet chemistry technology that are not normally used to monitor and measure sulfu r in the natural gas Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring

other has been impacted but not tot the point of disturbing all the vegetation just foot and vehicle traffic I dont have problem with saying the above but keep in mind the facility has been there and just because the trees havent been disturbed doesnt mean that the understory beneath the trees has been pristine It has always been Transweterns policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its locations especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value scenery wildlife etc I dont have a problem with including resource reports and for vegetation and soils I have received a verbal from the US Fish and Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or critical habitats In addition the adjacent lands are of the same habitat types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore would not be an issue of habitat loss There are not any old TW hands around to positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural encroachment of the trees into the area I seriously doubt it Again TW tried to mantain a postive presence at each site but did utilize the sites for their intended purpose In Arizona we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic testwater We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from the closest City ie Flagstaff for station construction or from a drinking well source In any event we will test the water prior to discharge and ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the ground I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe If we need to discuss the above give me a call Hackett Terry NSRcom on PM To cc Subject Station Concerns Larry I gave the tree issue at Station some thought and I have a couple of concerns regarding the environmental report The report is being written based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard and on previously disturbed ground If we impact areas even within existing facilities that were not previously disturbed we are required to include environmental data about those areas So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been previously disturbed To help determine this I downloaded a USGS aerial of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the station yard look to be the same agesize as those surrounding the station This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees have not been previously disturbed A copy of the aerial is attached However it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial construction and the trees simply grew back Unfortunately I dont have that information and dont know if you do either And let me point out that my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct but the amount of information supplied in the report I want to feel comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC For this project that would primarily include a description of the existing vegetation and soils resource report and All we would really need is a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils and how much will be permanently impacted etc However we did not budget any time to obtain this information nor did we anticipate the need for site visits My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously disturbed or not If not I hope to come up with some verbiage that everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements Otherwise we will have to obtain the necessary information and thats beyond our initial scope If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects that may provide enough information Again it only needs to be brief Also we need to verify for the other stations that we are constructing in previously disturbed areas Lastly Arnold has indicated that the hydrotest water will come from existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under Transwesterns blanket permit

Deconning the separators becomes an internal washing job of the vessel I will discuss this with Tiny about possibly using someone else Tiny do you think Riley would be interested in tackling this issue for us and PGE As you know they do not have a deconning permit from the EPA but with the new PCB rules in place a permit is not necessary anymore to do deconning activities How do you think PGE

make certain that the equivalent thoughts are on there Now about item and your closing paragraph Item No I do not want to open the issue of the PCB Model to PGE at this time Maybe later but not now As far as your thoughts in the closing paragraph Randy Rice and I want the Ultimate Separators deconned We took great pains last fall when we had the separators down to test and decon them so we could establish a base line Why would we take the system down and change the filters out and test any residue without also deconning the facility If we did that then hypothetically next fall when we took the system down and changed the filters if we took any wipe samples it could contain residue accumulated over a two year period and not just during the past twelve months It seems to me that it makes much more sense to decon the separators at the same time that we change the filters and that way we will know exactly what has hit them sense the last time we opened them up Im open to further argument on it but that is the way Randy and I see it at this point in time On the subject of the selection of the contractor Randy and I believe that you and Tiny should probably select whatever consulting firm can do the best job and is most dependable Remember that PGE had confidence in Vector at least that is what I recall from last fall So if we go with a new consultant will PGE have the same confidence Also you and Tiny must make certain that the firm we use has some acceptable credentials What PCB issues have they handled in the past etc I will be glad to discuss any of this with

perspectives in the Flagstaff area Forwarded by Larry CampbellETSEnron on AM From David Roensch PM To Larry CampbellET nron John ShaferOTSEnron cc Subject Larry per our phone conversation tonight I found this article interesting especially in light of potential future expansions on TW Note the section below in bold Red text Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station just across Interstate and as you know Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROWs but it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas Anyhow fyi Oh yea The Grand Canyon Trust The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building New land pegged for preservation By ANNE MINARD Sun Staff Reporter Reader Comments Its been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly rejected Proposition a plan to protect acres of State Trust Land from development And in about a month voters could be asked to begin signing petitions to get another initiative on the ballot that would protect significantly more of the states legacy million acres or about percent including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff The difference conservationists say is that this land has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically and aesthetically important areas The environmental community rallied against Prop because they said the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and had little value for conservation For example the Proposition campaign identified acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff near a wastewater treatment plant outflow as one of the states crown jewels needing to be preserved Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an industrial park and acres of steep slopes littered with shotup refrigerators and television sets called Turkey Hills Rogers Lake an important wetland and major ecosystem south of Flagstaff was also slated for preservation under Prop But that plan only included its soggy lakebed while acres of highly developable shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was still up for grabs THE NEW PLAN The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers Lake excluding those that are private or held by the US Forest Service One proposed parcel does still fall in the Turkey Hills area and three others lie between Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon not included is Section which is likely to be sold and developed but at densities that are still in dispute between the county and the city Other areas would include parcels around Observatory Mesa a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the Naval Observatory and a checkerboard pattern of sections interspersed with Forest Service land south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and Griffiths Spring Like Prop an initiative would be only a first step If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass it would take an act of Congress and a constitutional amendment to change the availability of State Trust Lands State Trust Lands include about million acres across the country million in Arizona originally allocated by the federal government when each state was formed to help fund public schools See related story on Page A Brad Ack program director for the Flagstaffbased Grand Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative said the states schools shouldnt be bought and paid for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl Areas set aside under the initiative could still be leased for grazing agriculture or other current uses but they would never be sold for commercial development Making an informed decision to set aside designated State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that now accompany proposals to develop them he said The initiative is a collaborative effort between the Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups along with some business and development affiliates And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by the Grand Canyon Trust the Sonoran Institute in Tucson and the Nature Conservancy that showed percent of Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizonas State Trust Land should be conserved TALKING COMPENSATION But members of the State Department of Lands charged with managing the tracts and a lobbyist for superintendents and principals in the states school system say the initiative backers are missing the mark in the state land debate We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our friends in the environmental community said Mike Smith a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School Administrator Association Preserve set aside we think those are great ideas The question is compensation Those State Trust Lands are in trust for the schools Its acutely important for schools to maximize the returns on state lands Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is new for the states schools Until recently the schools didnt see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts We havent seen any of it The state Legislature has taken the annual earnings and has used it to reduce state aid coming out of the general fund That all changed with the passage of Proposition passed last year he said In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools they also said By the way all new earnings from the state trust fund go into the school site fund All of a sudden its real different for us Before it supplanted our funding now it will supplement it Its real money to us The Legislature will still keep the money it has been earning from State Trust Lands about million a year But anything above that mark will now go to the schools and both Smith and Nick Simonetta manager of communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona Department of Lands are optimistic that figure will climb rapidly in the coming years Simonetta estimates the schools could see million in addition to legislative appropriations over the next decade LOOKING BACK But the past irregularities are a stronghold for conservationists who are promoting the land reform initiative In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform Initiative the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State Trust Lands havent been used as they were intended anyway and very little money has gone to Arizona schools State Trust Lands currently provide less than percent of the annual funding for public education the document reads there is little if any direct benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that assessment I think those statements are severely misleading and not reflective of what is currently the case You can throw around percentages any way you want If you look at what the trust has been contributing to the school construction budget its more like or percent Regardless Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate funds and wont be given away for free It comes down to this We are in intense discussion with the conservation community Smith said Our conversations are all around the question of compensation We are not going to support any initiative that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without compensation You can take that nonsupport as far as you like If they attempt to go to Congress we are going with them

to NWNGs commitment to enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG Risk Cost Notices of Violation NOVNotices of Noncompliance NON In a summary page provided by NWNG a list of all state and federal agency actions against the company was available Although the company had received a few notices they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small recordkeeping and right of way issues There were no outstanding judgements NOVs NONs or pending agency actions or issues to be resoved Risk Cost PCBs In interviews with NWNG they attested to the fact that they have never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system was unknown Risk Cost Mercury Mercury was used on the NWNG system but only in monometers and not in natural gas metering equipment A decision was made by environmental management of NWNG in to remove mercury manometers An investigation has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment which may have been used Risk Cost Onsite Disposal Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas plants in interviews with NWNGs environmental management they were not aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous toxic or non hazardous waste Risk Cost undefined Hazardous Waste There is only one location where hazardous waste is generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is used This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous waste Risk Cost NORMS The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually occurring radioactive materials NORMS are not a problem in the pipeline system Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this nor does NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest Pipeline Company Risk Cost Underground Storage Tanks UST There is only one regulated underground storage tank UST remaining on the NWNG system Albany and this tank is in complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring testing and recordkeeping All other underground tanks have been removed At one of the tank removal sites there exists an active remediation in progress Closure of this site is expected in the near future Risk Cost LNG plants In interviews with NWNG environmental management there are no histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural gas LNG plants The exception to this is a historic site of a manufactured gas plant Linnton site which underlies the LNG plant This issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas Plant Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plants NWNG owned and operated a number of manufactured gas plants MGPs Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks Eugene Water and Electrical Board The City of Eugene has determined that a parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by numerous responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time period of The Eugene Water and Electrical Board EWEB which is the regulatory agency in Eugene has determined that the total cost to clean the entire area will be approximately of which the EWEB has indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be NWNG has offered to pay compensation damages in the amount of to be relaesed from all liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City of Eugene The environmental management of NWNG has stated that the EWEB has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG offer of approximately Risk Cost Salem Site According to NWNG management this historic MGP site has been remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem which is the regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site NWNG has received endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature Risk Cost Manufactured Gas Plant This site which ceased operation in the early s was dismantled and abandoned From the time the facility ceased operations untill the present a railroad has constructed a steel rail bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park The site is immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River a major perennial watercourse in Oregon There have been no soil groundwater or river river sediment studies completed to determine potential environmental impacts NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds of London The insurance policies were not available at the time of this due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this site Risks Costs Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Environmetnal Protection Agency has determined that the Portland Harbor on the Wilammette River has received contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify the miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site This superfund site extends for a distance of miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites originally owned by NWNG The EPA has designated approximately primary responsible parties which are directly or indirectly involved in the contamination of this section of the Willamette River NWNG has been identified as a contributing member to the contamination Linnton MGPWacker Site The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site has acres of water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the Portland Harbor Superfund Site The Linnton facility which originally included the Wacker Site initiated operation in and ceased operation in During the operation of the facility operation various organic coal tar wastes comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids LNAPLs and dense non aqueous phase liquids DNAPLs were generated Characteristically these waste products include polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs BTEX and cyanide During the early stages of facility operation these wastes were originally directly deposited into the Willammette River and then later in unlined ponds were constructed at the facility Preliminary investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility operations which were released either directly or indirectly into the soil underlying the facility or into the Wilamette River were in excess of million gallons or cubic yards It was also estimated from these reports that there is approximately cubic yards of tar and tar mixed with soil underlying the historic tar ponds Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to or more years NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of London which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNGs portion of this superfund responsibility The policies were not availble during the due diligence to verify or confirm the amount of coverage Additionally because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the subsurface soil groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not been determined it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be evaluated It should also be mentioned that because the proportionate extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known adequate insurance coverage appears to be somewhat premature Risk Cost ,campbell-l,Employee

Mexico showed up at my office this morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our CS south of Roswell I felt the need to tag along with them Heres the way it is The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act ESA This is not a new issue with the EPA Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for CS and The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed I told the engineer that becasue CS and are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA As you remember the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue He advised me not to do this I think his decision had something to do with the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly delay issuance of the permits Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA From Donna nronXgate on PM CDT To Larry CampbellET NRON cc Subject FW question on Transwestern Larry Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting a TE survey at Stations prior to issuing air permits Dont know if you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process but Steve Burns sent the following message to me which I thought I had forwarded to yousorry looks like I didnt Any way I dont know if he could help push the process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW onlyif so give him a call Original Message From Burns Stephen Sent Monday July AM To Martens Donna Cc Fritch Bret Gutierrez Cecil Bagot Nancy Westbrook Roger Robertson Linda Nord Sue Subject RE question on Transwestern Thanks Donna The reason I ask is that weve been fighting a long politicalpolicy issue here in Washington on rightsofway across federal lands Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications EBS and fiber optic cables The agencies weve been pitted against are the BLM and Forest Service and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of companies The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables theyll also do to pipelines Two weeks ago I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this issue El Paso pipelines told me theyve had a tough time getting compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion into California My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rightsofway and you think you might need some help please feel free to let me know We meet regularly with Dept of Agriculture senior staff and should soon meet with the new Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth We could help if you have any problems Cant help you with the Navajo Nation though But seriously wed always like to learn if you

the month additional time beyond the September issuan ce which would be required for the permit issuance In light of this issue we in ETS might want to use this as a training exercise and develop a

returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell hadreceived a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possibl e meeting with them I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday The strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California politicallawyer typewho would have the necessary contacts to get us in there and get the permits moving Lou agreed and we have been working o n that strategy while gathering more information related to the right conta ct that could get this job done I personally have had lengthy discussions Thursday and Friday with Lou Larry Campbell Bill Kendrick and several k ey consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and CaliforniaWe are closing in on alocal law firm and also a high le velair consultantwho will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief levelto present oursituation clean air needs for Arizona a nd CA and how long these permits have already been on file We should hav e someone identified early this next week Let me present the following information tocomplement yours The permitting timelinebeing usedwas based on historical timelinesencounteredwhile processing prior Arizona projects No indication of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning A familiar consultan t Argentwas used for the air permit applications and no indication was offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not occurring Applications filed in March and by letter from the age ncies were deemed complete by midApril Within the last two weeks the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to th e applications for Station and has stated that he is overloaded and worki ng on the applications as they are in the que He told Larry Campbell a nd I have verifiedit also by talking to outside consultants that permit in Arizona that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in getting permits out Caveat One of the suggestions we want to carry in to AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a thirdparty contractor to take the permits and work them upfor release to the publishing firm so they can be sent out for public comment AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us a nd discuss our applications Even if we get this part going this is only part of the problem Bottom line iswe must play our cardscorrec tly at this juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que typed and out for public comment but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after that for their review of those two state issued permits EPA Region IX is a different story It is most difficult to put press ure on them more so than AZ DEQ The applications for Stations and are on tribal land and theseapplications are not delegated to any state air qu ality departmentAfter the technical meetings in the office last week La rry made a couple of callsto the Permit Engineerin Region IX and received a negative response Larry was told that thepermits would issue in one to four months and thatthere was no need for a meeting with them Againmy adv ice at this point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high level and get the meeting set Its one thing to pressure the State of Arizona and get a permit applications moving but if we are not very carefu l with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devils permits but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching Again we must first get a personal meeting with themto enable us to presentthe need circumstances and how long these permits have already been on file Locating thecorrect person to help us do that is of upmost importance Clarifying the complicated point EPA Region IX has responsibility toreview and publish not only the permits for Stations and but to also review the AZ DEQ permits for stations and for days Therefor e if we anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations and they could delay the issuance of the permits for Stations and thathave been expedited wi th the AZ DEQ Its a twoedged sword Our Strategy Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers but very carefully Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them Locate a politicallawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX to help us get thedesired meeting with keypeople in order tomovethe permits This should be done within the next week Offer to assist in any manner eg funding a third party to get the permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comme nt I have some strategic ideas that will increase theprobability that this type of circumstance will not occur in the future I will be glad to discuss any of this with you on Monday morning John Shafer Original

in the bush and Red Rock is a bird in the hand There is no way that we can get the Red Rock project completed as promise d because we waited until it was too late to find out what was going on with

permit and the EPA permits for and Briefly here they are First issue that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ It applies to hours of operation for the generator The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility In talking to Shdeish the ADEQ protects itself and applies a safety factor on all applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not triggered This is there policy not regulation What is ironic is that they accepted our calculations for the netting but did not indicate that they would apply any safety factor for their comfort Im concerned about t he time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date I need some guidance Do we want to spend time fighting this not knowing how lon g it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours In speakin g with Shudeish I got the impressions that when an application approaches th e PSD limit they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro l technology just to be sure that they stay under the ton limit I know time is of the essence Second issue The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations and but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO instead of lbhr or tonyr The values that they have given us in the permit are OK ppm vd for NOx and CO at base load operation GE will guarantee this However at lower tempertures and at reduced loads of the manufactures numbers are ppmvd for NOx and CO We cant live with this In our application we stated that we would be operating at low loads for of the time and we applied a safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented this in lbhr and tonsyr This would have covered us but because the permits limits are in ppmvd we would exceed these limits during low loads and low temps I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit conditions that would allow us ppmvd during low temps and low loads with with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou ld bring this before his management Ill keep you apprised of this issue

the EPA came back with NSPS limits which of course hurt us when we operate at loads of less than We c an either cave in to their NSPS limits and when we get under low load condtion s just do a bunch of recycling which wastes gas or we can spend some valuabl e time trying to get the EPA to give us emission limitations in lbhr or tyr Im discussing this with the EPA permit engineer He is ch ecking

comments to the air perimts at and Please review for clairty and content I have spoken to Roger Ko hn about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No He is checking on what the EPA can do about this I have spoken to Arno ld Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict ppmvd requriement for NO x and CO and he has said that we can hold to the ppm value by doing some major gas recycling This is a fuel waste and costly Anyway depen ding upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably determine whether we give in to the ppmvd or hold out for ppmvd Id like your comments asap The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to ppmv at O based on a hour average except during periods of startup and shutdown At F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions However GE data indicates that NOx and C O may be as high as ppmv during lowload conditions of and lower The permit application represented turbine op erations at base load of the time with reduced load operations load occurring no more than of the time The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lbhr and tonyr These values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis and took were taken into account by the EPA See EPA Statement of Basis document Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lbyr or tonyear values Transwestern is concerned tha t under low load conditions of less than the emissions of NOx and CO would be ppmvd Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that emissions of NOx and CO be held to ppmvd during the of the time that the

indicated that the June target date for in service is on schedule There will be mainline separators for each mainline system PGE is also on schedule for June pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the gallon tank at the separator installation site This is a PGE issue and will not create a delay of the inservice date All other permits and approvals according to PGE are in place PGE has stated that after operation of the separators they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ETS Post construction of the separators will result in ft joints of in pipe PGE will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal If the pieces test to be regulated by state and federal PGE will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material If the decision is to decon PGE has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco Good news is that at MP kettleman CS latest sampling showed non detect The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing toward Hinkley CS Line is a in line which travels north to Ridgecrest Ca also feeds IMC Chemical Plant Previous testing showed non detect Most recent sample showed ppm Second sample has been collected but results are not available Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PGEs biggest single commercial customer and therefore this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCBs Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations of ppm The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co system which is PCB free Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency West end of the PGE system has not been sampled The east end of the system has at least rounds of sampling conducted Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks When a sampling location is shown to have liquids it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the sampling program Transwestern has requested to PGE to increase the collection reservoirs under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the pipeline system At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the bottom of the valve and meter body for the liquids collection By increasing the nipple size a greater collection container will be produced It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the separators PGE will continue to sample each location once every two weeks Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap FilterSeparators Originally locations were identified to receive the small filter separators These locations were considered Priority sites The determination of a Priority site is based upon the following criteria a location where liquids were collected twice and ppm concentration of the liquids collected was ppm Based upon these criteria Ridgecrest and Bakersfield Kern River Station have been added to the list of Priority sites Flow through at the Kern River location is mmscfday Samples collected at this location have shown PCBs in the range of ppm PGEs agreement with SoCal at this location is ppm PCBs in the liquid phase PGE has indicated that there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume of gas deliveries PGE and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning additional filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer load at these locations Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection at these sites PGE has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express additional concern for PCBs at their interconnect locations Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap FilterSeparators a Siting Design and Engineering b Cost Estimates PGE passed out a booklet pertaining to small filter separator sites plus an additional sheet for sites with backup to be produced in the next week Four of these separators have been installed A total of filter separators may be proposed for installation The cost estimates for the additional small volume FS up to the indicated at the last meeting is to million The sampling costs have not been included in this number Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites basis as PGE presented One PGE customer a cement plant has inquired about PGE deconning portions of their plant that has PCBs PGE is in discussions with the cement company PGE has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the cement plant prior to committing to any action If the deconning occurs it will be a project Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection Compressor Oil Control The majority of liquids collected at strategic sampling locations is compressor oils Transwestern has requested access to the PGE CS to study lube oil systems There are compressors at the Topock and Hinkley CSs Transwestern will conduct a study of technologies to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system Earl will coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle Other Issues or Concerns Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to Transwestern PGE is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to mmscfday cap by May Over time PGE will look into their CS configurations to handle the increased gas flows to mm scfday Next Steps The next meeting was proposed in days This time period will allow inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites The location of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July as some of the PGE meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on other business,campbell-l,Employee

Team LagunaET nron Ted NRON Subject Meeting with the Lagunas over the PCB remediation at CS I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB remediation activities by TW On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna pueblo the PEOP a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the pueblos in New Mexico ranging from UST to superfund and members of ETS members of the Laguna team Butch Russell Rick Smith advisor for the Laguna team myself and George Robinson This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo The meeting centered around two issues at the site the closure of the UST and the PCB remediation activity With respect to the first concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis and send the results to POEP for review With repsect to the PCB remediation issue things were a little different The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the Lagunas have verified this They indicated that that have been patient with Transwsterns attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB contamination but based upon the historic sampling results that this technology is not proving to be very successful in fact the results have shown stagnant results Im using their words They would like to see Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site Members of the Laguna pueblo who work for the POEP expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a cancer with potential to spread A comment was made by the POEP that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from North Dakota State University Energy and Environmental Research Center who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the PCB containing liquids present at the site Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their service they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi the POEP Superfund representative was at this meeting He had mentioned that the POEP has been in discussions with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL He had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list but stated that Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done At the conclusion of the meeting I informed the POEP that Transwesterns internal remediation group would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions This seemed to satisify the POEP and they were content with this John I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue A couple of things I want to bring out First we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the Lagunas in the near future Second on the Laguna tribal lands they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem Although we are considered by the POEP as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with direct quote from the POEP they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from Transwestern to clean up the PCBs Please get back with me on this,campbell-l,Employee

Hoover and Keith out of Houston Tx I have a meeting scheduled with the permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting for the two CS on state lands Ive dealt with these individuals before but the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on that After that meeting I will decide who should do the applications I have calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the two locations on the Navajo lands Pending the outcome of each meeting I will decide who to use Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits and Indian lands permits and they would probably be my first choice I am keeping Mr Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or activities that impact the permits for Arizona One thing that I shold mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential kinks Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline units which will be permitted for a six month period there will still be an overall major emissions decrease After the six month period the existing units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again Also my intent is to permit these turbines at ppm NOx as opposed to the lower ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on the Northern Border system If this was a new station I probably wouldnt be allowed to use the number but seeing as how there will be a major decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine this should be easy to do The differrence in emission between and is not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of operation comfort as opposed to the ppm number that Rolls says they can do but has had trouble reaching One thing that has complicated the permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations By permitting at ppm this will greatly help this Ill share the emissions numbers with you when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions info I have from the existing units I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F document for the FERC submittal and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the report Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation the F report will be completed by March Is there something Ive missed William
