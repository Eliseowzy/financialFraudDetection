commodity exchanges seem not to realize that there are several good reasons why benchmarks deri ved from volumetric indices may not workand may not be usefulfor physic al products such as oil and petrochemicals But there are other routes to price discovery By Neil Fleming Apr Global Energy Business Page Copyright McGrawHill Inc Somewhere near Internetbased exchanges for energy oil petrochemicals and hydrocarbon shipping have been launched worldwide over the past two y ears But most have since folded or been acquired Its interesting to note that virtually all of those exchangesboth the survivors and the deceased have two things in common They were created from scratch by entrepren eurs from the technology world or from the industries their exchanges are or were intended to serve The businessmen and women behind them have followed the same train of thought in concluding that online trading was a business they could succeed at This train of thought can be broken down into four parts Premise Online trading is more efficient and will save its particip ants money Premise I can capture some of those savings as site revenue Premise My site will be the best site out there so everyone will use it Premise With all this liquidity I can construct benchmarks My benchmar ks will be unimpeachably scientific and replace the existing unscientific benchmarks currently used by the industry As a result I will make even mo re money because I will become an information provider This article will examine those premises and the limits of their inherent l ogic with a view to showing why very fewif anyof the launched exch anges will survive In particular it will show why the logic of Premise is not valid for markets in physical commodities such as oil and petrochem icals Premise Online trading is more efficient Few would question that in theory electronic trading has the potential to make liquid markets much more efficient The history of EnronOnline proba bly the most successful electronic energy trading system in the world today supports that view According to Enron EnronOnline has succeeded in rais ing the number of transactions completed by each of its market makers from an average in to last year while lowering the marginal cost per transaction by over the twoyear period However the markets that EnronOnline predominantly serves are two of the m ost liquid and homogeneous in the energy business natural gas and electric ity Moreover the exchange has achieved its efficiency gains using a model very different from any deployed byor available tomost online exchang es Essentially Enron has used online trading to extend and complement it s existing offline trading business Enrons focus remains the transactio n rather than the transaction system By contrast the majority of transaction platforms for physical commodities are interlopers Their operators assume that commodities traders are willi ng to depersonalize their business by having their complex transactions exe cuted not by humans but by an electronic system that can do deals faster a nd more anonymously andat least in theorywith more players This assumption is a risky one largely because it is based on a buyers pe rception of how marketplaces should operate It fails to take into account the concerns of physical commodity sellers andmore importantlyproducers Typically producers wish to ensure that the uptake of their commodity is continuous because that minimizes the volatility of the commoditys price Relationships become allimportant under such conditionsbut relationshi ps are hardly enhanced by electronic dealing To quote the NovemberDecembe r issue of the Harvard Business Review Few suppliers want to be ano nymous contestants in ruthless bidding wars Premise I can make money selling gains in efficiency The logic underlying Premise is potentially seriously flawed For while t here is no doubt that market participants are prepared to pay for more effi cient services such as electronic trading the nature of the forces drivin g physical energy commodity markets casts doubt on whether a trading system can in the long term make a profit by charging pertransaction fees Heres why Although the era of competition is just beginning its clear t hat pressure on transaction fees is already downward and will remain in th at direction even if the number of participants in an exchange shrinks to a handful In the energy business the potential for efficiency gainsas a percentage of total industry costsimply is not that great For example r esearch done for Platts a division of The McGrawHill Companies New York indicates that the total potential efficiency pool in the oil industry is only millionyear Even if only businesses were to try to carve a profitable enterprise out of such a pool each would be hardpressed to do so Whats more such businesses would have an even harder time turning a profi t because some of their competitors wouldnt be using a pertrade revenue m odel In particular sites operated by market participants such as EnronOn line will tend to charge nothing per trade because their business models seek to profit not from commissions on transactions but rather from the tr ansactions themselves By implication it seems likely that an exchange wil l be able to make money only if its owners sell something else clearing fa cilities backoffice integration or information to decisionmakers Premise My site will be the best so it will capture all the market liqu idity available This statementwhich essentially says that given enough marketing support a site can change the trading patterns of an industry to capture all of it s liquidityis a fallacy The logical problem with the premise is clear Because no one has yet devel oped a trading software package that is clearly superior to others what best site really means is most liquid site So the precondition for capturing all the liquidity is that the site must already be the most l iquid site Some startup exchanges have attempted to solve this problem by insisting th at their participants make volume guarantees But volume guarantees conflic t directly with traders focus on profits Trading businesses that tell the ir traders to sacrifice profits for the sake of the common good are playing a risky game if the common good means lower trading profits the traders will simply leave for greener pastures To become the best site then a site must somehow find a way to bootst rap its liquidity perhaps by offering substantial nonvolumerelated ince ntives or efficiencies to users However the paradox is that most sites revenue models depend almost exclu sively on volume Premise Once I capture lots of liquidity I can build benchmarks This premise is the most startling andin some waysthe most flawed of th e four It raises many serious questions the answers to any of which can i nvalidate the model Worse these questions are all highly theoretical mak ing persuasive answers even harder to come by Among the questions are How much liquidity is enough Do indexes vo lumetric averages make good physical benchmarks Can a trading site ben chmark with the bidoffer range Can a trading site generate a close An d last but not least What is a benchmark anyway Benchmarks and indices A benchmark is a price or series of prices that a markets participants agr ee to use as the basis for determining other prices Useful benchmarks are good indicators of transactable value A benchmark allows market participan ts to determine at what price they should buy or sell the commodity Benchmarks are typically used in complex markets with multidimensional var iables for arbitrage In oil for example benchmark pricing has grown up a round the need to compute relative values for differing commodities across time geographical distance commodity type and the degree to which one co mmodity may be substituted for another It is a common error however to believe that markets should or do use the ir most liquidly traded commodities as benchmarks Although liquidity is a major asset of benchmarks many markets use illiquid benchmarks whose other characteristics outweigh the liquidity advantage These include market tra nsparency the free and open availability of the commodity the absence of political or partisan control of the commodity the absence of delivery res trictions on it and the size of the enduser market where the commodity wi ll be consumed For example although the physical volume of Dubai crude oi l actually produced is tiny it nonetheless is used as a key benchmark for all of Asia becauseunlike its Persian Gulf competitorsit is the only cr ude oil that has these characteristics One way to compute a commoditys benchmark price is through strict indexati on the process of constructing a price marker from a volumetric average of concluded business However this process will have little chance of produ cing a useful benchmark unless the contributing volumes are high If it doe snt reflect a sufficient number of trades an index has little or no stati stical validity as an indication of transactable price This represents a problem for benchmarking oil prices whether for crude or products Of the million barrels of crude produced worldwide each day the vast majority are sold on the longterm contract market leaving perhap s as little as to be traded spot In reality this figure is booste d in multiple ways primarily by transaction chainingthe repeated onsell ing of cargosbut even assuming threefold transaction growth as a result of electronic trading is still perilously low to be used as a valid basis for strict indexation especially considering the great diversity of crude oil specifications around the world For many crude oils the trading basis for establishing price can be just a few transactions per month Even for liquid benchmark crudes the basis is typically just a handful of trade s per day Oil markets however dont seem to care For example the settl ement basis for the International Petroleum Exchanges Brent crude oil futu res contract is an index based on a smattering of physical trades taking place on the day of expiry Acceptance of an indexa tion mechanism such as this has difficult prerequisites These include open participation in the mechanism the perceived existence of a level playi ng field the existence of comparative historical data and achieving b uy in from the markets dominant players The nature of todays online exchanges makes these conditions hard to meet Not everyone uses exchanges they may be owned by industry players they typically have little or no historical data their daily volume fluctuates wildly and major players commitment to them is either fragmentary or comp romised by volume commitments In todays environment the chance that an i ndex will be able to gain market acceptance as a benchmark is extremely sli m Are strict volumetric indices useful Another big question surrounding volu metric indices is how useful they are as benchmarks for physical commoditie s Advocates of indexation argue that its statistical methodology helps eli minate market distortions caused for example by market closes In additio n they argue that the alternative approachmarket assessment based o n human judgements about transactable pricesis too subjective to be relie d on to determine benchmark prices Indexation its proponents argue eli minates this subjectivity In practice however this argument doesnt pass the so what test Eve n if a system such as indexation succeeds in taking judgement out of the de termination of market prices it cannot prevent attempts to distort the ind ex by exploiting the rules on which the system is based In many markets human judgement is the only effective defense against mark et plays whose goal is profit not price transparency Even in highly liqui d marketssuch as for example the monthly natural gas market in the US the indices generated by information companies like Platts are subject to human review and analysis During their generation Platts market special ists undertake a string of comparative tests to unearth potential distortio ns in reported prices Whenever such distortions become apparent Platts e ditors investigate the market further and where necessary eliminate certa in trades from the assessment picture There are good reasons for their dil igence A volumetric index can be manipulated by volume plays by a few pla yers under the cloak of anonymous dealing by selective trading or by hedging in one marketplace and trading in another Figures and illustrate how players with exposure to a particular price on the buy side mightand actually domanipulate a volumetric index By d oing lots of business early in the day when the market is rising they can skew the volumetric average for the day lower Figure When the market i s falling they reverse the pattern and shift their transactions to late in the day again pushing the market down Figure When players do this co nsistently the impact on an index can be considerable over time There are other potentially more serious problems with indices Because an index is a theoretical construct in a rapidly moving market it will manif est lagand become useless to market participants seeking the answer to th e question At what price should I buy or sell Indeed an index may ev en actively mislead people asking this question For example in a fast ris ing market an index generated over the course of one day will be significa ntly below the opening market price on the following day This creates the impression that prices have somehow moved overnight whereas in fact they m ay not have moved at all But perhaps the biggest problem with indices relates to their use in heavil y interlinked markets where prices are constrained by a complex of spread and arbitrage values This description applies to most energy markets and is particularly apt for todays global physical market for oil In markets where spread relationships are as or more important than outright prices the process of generating averaged indices tends to generate sets of prices that cannot be reconciled with each other Figure depicts a dramatized version of this problem Price and Price are interdependent here there is always a cents difference between them However the volume pattern for the days trade shown in the lower part of the figure is such that while Price has very high volume early in the day Price does not enjoy its volume boost until later The result Cont rary to market reality the volumetric averages for Price and Price say that they only differ by cents Other routes to price discovery So if an online trading system cannot generate a reliable benchmark from an index are there other routes to price discovery Yes two The first is to benchmark from a bidoffer range and the second is to use a close of s ome kind Bidoffer ranges are widely used as market measurement tools by Platts and others However the automated application of bidoffer ranges in pursuit o f scientific benchmarks is fraught with difficulty What happens when t here is a bid but no offer An offer but no bid What rules can be writte n to discriminate between an offmarket bid and an onmarket one H ow should a system decide when a bid or offers timing is not representativ e of the typical market Most online exchanges have not even begun to answ er these questions and at best offer their users a last bidlast offer price range that can accidentally distort their perception of the market if the two are not aligned in time or if it turns out for example that t he last bid was actually withdrawn in response to the last offer Some exchanges implicitly acknowledging that creating useful benchmarks is difficult have tried to incorporate their transactions and bidoffers int o published benchmarks Obviously they hope that their system will attract more liquidity if it is tied to a traditional benchmark But its safe to say that a publisher will be interested in incorporating an exchanges prop rietary markers only if transaction bidoffers are open and transparent Can an online site benchmark from a close In theory yes But if human ha nds and brains intervene the process is no longer a mechanical one but ra ther an editorialjudgement effort Here too there are many obstacles One of the biggest is that closing prices work best in two kinds of markets c ompletely open markets in which assessments are derived by surveying a ll participants and soleoperator marketslike futures marketswhere the traded instrument exists only on that exchange Physical commodities by contrast are traded across a broad spectrum of in struments and submarkets It would be virtually impossible for the owner o f a single submarketor online exchangeto assert the superiority of it s close over someone elses or to build market acceptance for a price deri ved from a trading pool that doesnt include all players Even a system used by most playersfor example the oil industrys derivat ivestrading Intercontinental Exchangewould have a hard time convincing a nyone to rely exclusively on its closing prices Thats not only because most is not the same as all but also because liquidity is frequently too low to assure that there will in fact be a traded market to close ever y day What happens to the benchmark on days when no one comes out to play In conclusion it appears that price discovery may not necessarily be an em ergent property of online trading systems That may be the case because th e creators of most online trading systems have confused its mechanism with its function Trading systems are neither new markets nor new marketplaces they are simply new vehicles for participating in existing marketplaces A telephone is also a vehicle for participating in marketsbut no one expe cts their phone to be able to tell them the price of a commodity GEB Related Topics Dow Jones Topics Publication Global Energy Business News ENGL Copyright Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC All Rights

FORTUNEs List of Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire NEW YORKBUSINESS WIREOct LowerProfile Women Topple More Wellknown Names From Tech and Internet Sector Ranking Includes Newcomers Though HewlettPackard lost billion in market value in a year CEO Carly Fiorina hasnt lost her nerve and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No position on FORTUNEs ranking of the Most Powerful Women in Business The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October issue of FORTUNE available on newsstands October and at wwwfortunecom at pm on October In the No spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman who runs an Internet company that actually makes money million in the last four quarters on million in revenue Oprah Winfrey the Queen of Media is mightier than ever and holds the No spot up from No last year She produces movies brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers propels books to bestsellerdom and last year teamed up with Hearst Magazines Cathie Black No on the list to publish O The Oprah Magazineby some measures the most successful magazine startup ever At No is Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon who has breathed life into ailing Avon Mirant CEO Marce Fullerthe only newcomer in the top fiveholds the No position Inside a stodgy utility Southern Fuller built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at her startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever Meg Whitman No on the list She has never overpromised to investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetarget profits every single quarter Fourteen newcomers join the list this year Marce Fuller President CEO Mirant Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas Colleen Barrett President COO Southwest Airlines Betsy Bernard President CEO ATT Consumer Anne Stevens VP North America Vehicle Operations Ford Motor Maria Elena Lagomasino Chairman CEO J P Morgan

Global Prescriptions Pharmacia Carole Black President and CEO Lifetime Television Networks Larree Renda EVP Retail Operations Safeway and Louise Francesconi VP and GM Missile Systems Raytheon While the economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same Says Sellers We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon Says Brooker Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them And thats what has made her one of the most successful CEOsmale or femalein recent years Over the past months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business how it advertises manufactures packages and even sells its products and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady but by reviving her The result growth in revenues operating profits and operating margins In addition FORTUNE includes an international list of the powerful women in business The top ten featured in the magazine are Marjorie Scardino CEO Pearson Britain Anne Lauvergeon Chairman Areva France Mary Ma Senior VP CFO Legend Hong Kong Marianne Nivert President CEO Telia Sweden Lien SiaouSze Vice President HewlettPackard Hong Kong Patricia Barbizet CEO Artemis France Eiko

conversastion Original Message From Belden Tim Sent Friday January AM To Kitchen Louise Lavorato John Subject Option on Employment Contract Like you I am getting very frustrated with this process I am genuinely trying to be as reasonable as possible I am not trying to hold up the deal at the last minute Im afraid that I am being asked to take a fairly large leap of faith after this company I dont mean the two of you I mean Enron has screwed me and the people who work for me I am generally ok with the concept of the option the doc and comp parameters In addition I need assurances that day retentions will be paid to the people we have identified who deserve them and havent received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in is secure It is unlikely that I would be here today if it werent for the collective comp conveyed to me during I have received assurances from the two of you Oxley and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received The messages generally start with its safe dont worry about it all comp paid in advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate low probability that there will be any issues At other times particularly when you want me to commit to this deal the logic changes The comp paid in becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if Im on the team While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in the answer is that it is off the table a nonstarter Why Because the estate is negotiating the deal Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate I wouldnt be here but for the legacy issues with the estate it is definitely the buyers issue Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estatethe buyer have time Because we dont know who from the buyer to negotiate with Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues why not figure it out now Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden Im not delusional I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts If its bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me Since I am not on the team right now I am also working with a great deal less information than you have I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people on the team versus not on the team However the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind For example I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done conveyed to the creditorsbuyerestatejudge works Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them If thats the case you could add my indemnification amount adjusted by probability of payout to that total and it surely wouldnt blow up the deal Unless the probability of payout is high Furthermore I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc subject to comment from my lawyer but Ill try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer At that point in time I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc Perhaps at that time some of the comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent I dont understand why this is a nonstarter issue but I dont have the same information that you do To be clear here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer the deal as it exists plus retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them indemnification of comp up to million I expect that the two of you will tell me that Im not on the team that people are going home and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives That is not what I want to happen If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldnt happen I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days I trust that you are trying to do the right thing There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time Finally I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier Its probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say I will call to see that you received and read this email I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do Tim,kitchen-l,President

accomplish some things for the estate and that like Mark Haedicke and perhaps himself there could be some issues with the Estate and creditors committee if we were to go to Netco immediately What I agreed to with Greg is that I will be focused on the Estate and that I would be interested in talking about Netco in to days In the meantime I will participate as much as you would like for me to on the due diligence process around the auction I will gladly meet with any and all prospective buyers to make them comfortable with our processes systems staff expertise and operational controls And you

detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible The current restart date is January but may be pushed forward to January ii Budget due Jan To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs some of which can be amortized iii Seating Plans Tammy Shepperd to coordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors of the Enron South building I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January iv Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week Wednesday and Thursday Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday please help him with his requirements I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list Communication I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are I am asking David Oxley to coordinate with all of you on this I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible If you are unavailable this week please ensure you delegate this

Lo uise Hedstrom Peggy Koehler Anne C Redmond Brian SubjectIT Back Office Service Agreements Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties Beth has expressed some concerns about the e states ability to be able to support a production trading environment onc e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements Here are some suggestions Peggy Hedstrom in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity Bridgeline which is a JV in which ENA owns a interest currently has n o way that they can support themselves They are totally dependent on Enro n for everything from email internet network services and office applicat ions as well as trading risk and back office applications If there are c oncerns about the estates ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enrons best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO AEPHPL is more of a stand alone operation They have their own infrastruc ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter Open Link Financials and Altra Their goal w as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee n the applications listed above Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog ether a meeting to

Test Planning Coordination Mtg Summary Key Planning Assumptions Jan go live New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan This assumes all major production data setup users rights books global data is completed and tested on a per application basis Some co de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens ure the applications still talk to each other Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app lications and interfaces still work We will not be testing functional perm utations data conditions validation or exceptions to any significant degr ee Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin g their changes for integration testing We are operating from the premise that data infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio n system level before the enterprise integration test starts All systems will be physically split even Unify at this point Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es tate and New Co We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve rsion and test team purposes There are two teams Conversion and Integrat ion Test Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co nversion work can begin in earnest Estate conversion is on the critical pa th for New Co Key Issues We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi ng first then physical If financial is the focus delivery risk goes down dramatically For now we must plan on the worst case physical and fina ncial on Jan We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A EP and Bridgeline in Estate This means that we need a dev environment and HW gap addressed for Unify Sitara CPR TAGGERMS Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w ere in synch Unify servers probably cant be owned by New Co while running a single l icense of Unify Some systems are using short name instead of Duns ID as a key for coun terparties from Global The Global TAGG ERMS Unify and SAP reps must qu ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin g hard coded reference id risks We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi red to support day one trading We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP Bridgeline cons iderations The time window will be very small Core Conversion Team Steve

Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative senior unsecured debt BBB subordinated debt BBB preferred stock BBB and commercial paper F Pipeline subsidiary A rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co and Transwestern Pipeline Co are also placed on Rating Watch Negative The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company The loss of investor and counterparty confidence if it continues would impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital markets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business On Oct Enron announced a billion aftertax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of and a reduction of balance sheet equity by billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions Since that time there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management More importantly investors have voiced concerns Enrons common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business Approximately billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind While various sources of repayment exist such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets or an equity offering primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case Enron is required to deliver additional shares If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim While trigger events include a downgrade of Enrons senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enrons closing stock price over three consecutive trading days Enron would have a forebearance period of days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately billion Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt While capital market uncertainties have escalated Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enrons core wholesale retail and pipeline businesses

concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp ENE but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas the companies said Thursday The concerns have arisen because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week We

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos WMB to book million in power sales from the previous period as thirdquarter revenues the company said Thursday The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions The state of California has paid more than billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in midJanuary Two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back Its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday Williams reported thirdquarter net income of million on revenues of billion up from million on revenues of billion in the same period the year before Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales The process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves The ISO didnt envision thirdparty guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month state power officials have said The state says it has set aside billion to cover ISO transactions As reported suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free Willing To Renegotiate Separately Williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its longterm contracts with California provided the result benefited both parties California Gov Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of powersupply obligations perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market Malcolm said Were always willing to sit down with a customer Malcolm said Williams hasnt been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts Malcolm said Any attempt by California to force through onesided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants he said To the extent contracts are changed financing is going to go away he said Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of marketleader Enron Corp ENE saying it focuses on large longterm structured deals not the highvolume physicalmarket transactions that Enron dominates Malcolm said Also TradeSpark the Internetbased energy exchange in which Williams is a partner is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enrons proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ suffered in the attacks on the World

gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges

guest market commentator Maybe Kernen Yeah right Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer Go ahead say it Say what youre thinking No one has said it yet We know the truth We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze They knew every single number in this gas situation They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it Thats my bet My bet that thisthey hadlook they were the market maker Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someonewhen the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen Lets see what happened Haines Now wait a second David Faber coanchor Whoa whoa whoa The Justice Department Jim Now is that new Is that something Cramer No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber OK so they are not being investigated Cramer Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr Faber Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen Well lets talk about the actual news Heres yesterdays trading Haines Wait a minute Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here Did you readdid you know that Fastow after four Faber Late yesterday Kernen Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone Whats interesting Faber Hes the CFO Kernen But hes a new CFO Faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer This is my theory Haines OK Cramer It is just a theory It is my opinion But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines OK Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber Well what they need to do Joe they need to come clean I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to goif their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen I guess you would wouldnt you Faber Right Not that they arent but why would youif you can trade with seven other guysseven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen Now why would Faber And that would hurt their core business Kernen Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel Faber Because of something related to these liabilities they may have Kernen That they dont know about at this point Faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership Will it be a liability They dont know But thats one of the reasons Kernen Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber They dont know Kernen But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber Yes About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen This is a pretty big number Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks You got to look at here But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron Now were at sixteen Faber Everybody else took a hit yesterday Dynegy got hurt Kernen Well I got Dynegy next Dont Here we go Faber Im sorry Im getting a little excited Kernen You are Faber Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you Now Im worried about the utility average Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries Im angstridden Did you see this chart Were breaking below the Cramer Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen Whats wrong with Cramer today What happened Cramer Im all fired up Faber He really is My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA You going down to Enyou going down to Houston yourself Cramer I may just have to I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen Jim why would thethats thenow getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the postattack lows the utilities are retesting those Thats not something to worry about Cramer No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues I think the economy is showing signs of getting better The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong Much stronger than before Kernen All right In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though I dontwere talking about four hundred to twoninety at this point Thats a long way Cramer This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that Kernen Its no longer the Cramer you sell this as safety We dont want safety as much

drawn the scrutin y of the Securities and Exchange Commission In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive said in a statement announcing the change Only one day before Mr Lay had told in vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy The company said that Mr Fastow had taken a leave of absence but it also named his successor Jeffrey McMahon the head of Enrons industrial market s group and a former corporate treasurer Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange wh ere Enrons shares fell to The price has been cut in half si nce Oct when Enron reported its thirdquarter earnings A billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi th partnerships that Mr Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning s news release Mr Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo llowed but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings document and were angered wh en they later learned about it On Tuesday when both Mr Fastow and Mr Lay discussed the company with ana lysts on the conference call neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr Fastow Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiry in declining to discuss the detai ls of the transactions The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year but Enrons disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n ot lead to reported losses but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement That is one of the issues the SEC whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company is expected t o address Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying either i n cash or with stock if things went wrong On Tuesday Mr Fastow assure d investors that the company expects to continue to have sufficient liqui dity to meet normal obligations and said it had bank credit lines that w ere more than adequate Mr Fastow was viewed as one of the architects with Jeffrey K Skilling t he former Enron chief executive who resigned in

yesterday afternoon the lowest pri ce for the stock since early before recovering In afterhours tradin g they fell to One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities to drop her rating to sell from hold She had lowered the rating to hold from buy on Mond ay After the SEC inquiry was announced she said in an interview yester day evening Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat as a gesture to the Street Now they are replacing him today The timing is a little late but I think it will be received positively by

of fear of the unknown about Enron now with the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset writedowns Another thing theyre criticized for is their lack of disclosure We still havent seen a balance sheet for the third quarter People are saying why dont you include a balance sheet with your results They promised better disclosure in the past and that was meant to begin in the third quarter Youd like to see just more information on asset write downs and a discussion of their offbalancesheet financing all these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey Wed like to see some clarity answering those sort of questions It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of a process where theyre going to address and clean up their balance sheet and theyve started to replace management Investors have already had enough issues in corporate bonds recently and sometimes investors just think Not another nasty in my portfolio and Id rather exit For certain investors maybe they just get scared I wanted to know more about it People had speculated if it could go to junk I dont think they could because I dont think Enron could exist as a junk company Theres a certain reluctance to sell the bonds You want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have to reassess and see whether you think its a buying

All Rights Reserved HOUSTON AP Enron Corp may have added another question to the list inve stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha nge Commission inquiry It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC Prudential Securities Inc analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday W ho knows Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giants stocks have declined in value each day since Mon days announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a s CFO Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon wh o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enrons Industrial Markets group takes over his role I think change is good at this particular point in time said FAC Equitie s analyst Robert Christensen said I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered AG Edwards Sons analyst Mike Heim however said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements Heim s aid Replacing Fastow alone wont clarify those arrangements he added There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans parent to the financial community Heim said Instead of being more trans parent there is more confusion than ever Enrons stock continued to plummet Wednesday closing down to per share a percent decline Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week Enrons stock price has slid nearly percent The market was asking for that to happen JP Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg in said of Fastows departure This is really the first time Enron has act ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis Previously Enrons managers have been cautious and defensive in their app roach he said During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles The partnerships have sin ce been dissolved The call didnt work for many including Feygin and Heim I didnt hear things like weve unrolled all these partnership dealings or heres all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we dont ever expect to take any more charges Heim said What I heard is we dont hav e to disclose that information until the Q is filed The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry third qu arter losses and the August resignation of the companys chief executive of ficer Jeff Skilling have left many analysts questioning the companys fut ure Heim said Its really a speculative bet right now but the odds favor the company be ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro m now two years from now he said But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors F eygin said Feygin said McMahon worked as Enrons treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastows involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer Internally Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in the

allegedly proposed LJM as a way to hedge that volatility away This meant LJM entered agreements that gave it acce ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t he downside Should the whole board be on the hook too The spokeswoman re sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the markets views Arguably thats downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish shortterm financing Letting

Additionally two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants some analysts said Monday The market is really shrugging off this news said Mark Donahoe a managing director at US Bancorp

some data gathered after the Sept attacks The decline which was the indexs largest onemonth drop since January confirmed that the widespread weakness in the US economy is deepening the Conference Board said Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading In August the leadingindicators index slipped less than the previous estimate of a decline Even so the backtoback declines paint a bleak economic picture said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein The twomonth decline in the index

state Fastow and other Enron executives are named as the controlling partners or the board members in the companies Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants removing the debt for those

shortly Agence FrancePresse Copyright ABU DHABI Oct AFP Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement DPSA for a multi billiondollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad shortly the UAE Offsets Group UOG said Sunday The development and production sharing agreement DPSA with Qatar Petroleum QP is due to be signed shortly UOG said in a statement The staterun UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project Over the coming weeks the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December One of them is scheduled to be selected in early UOG said UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors Conoco ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States BP International and the AngloDutch firm Shell to replace the US firm Enron Corp which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its percent stake to UOG Enrons role was to build a kilometre mile pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi Dubai Oman and eventually Pakistan In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to billion dollars the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars lpdab Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATES FUTURE NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS Antonio Fins Business Writer South Florida SunSentinel Broward Metro H Copyright by the SunSentinel Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals natural gas is set to become a major player in Floridas energy grid The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade natural gas will account for percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities up from about percent now Utility companies use percent of the natural gas burned in Florida As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas miles off Floridas coast other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area Enron Corp of Houston is proposing to spend as much as million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades Enrons proposal is drawing rivals El Paso Corp also in Houston wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach And AES Corp has purchased Ocean Cay a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups Ultimately federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed Still electric companies which are proposing to build more than new power plants in Florida through are looking to make heavy use of natural gas Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas said Michael Haff an engineer at the PSC Thats the reason for the large increase in projections of natural gas usage All this is quite a change for Floridas electric utilities For decades power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Floridas power plants than to pipe in natural gas Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida Most users are small factories public laundries and restaurants where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because its easier to control the heat With little need for heating homes in winter residential use has generally been limited to barbecues water heaters and stoves Consequently Florida uses far less natural gas than many states Household use of natural gas is less than onefifth of what some households in other parts of the country use The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors The federal Clean Air act signed into law in is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators Natural gas is one of those options Alvaro Linero the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection said natural gas emits no particulate matter the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions Unlike oil or coal it gives off no sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions a key component of smog when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal Florida Power Light Co the largest of the electric companies has already heavily invested in natural gas generators of its nonnuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money but the utility regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability By natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico is finished Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the BahamastoFlorida pipeline projects as well Still some environmental groups say that while they want cleaner energy they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks Enron which applied to build a BahamastoFlorida pipeline said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe But Broward officials and a conservationist group Hollywoodbased Save Our Shores have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad NM last year killing people the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters stoves and even gasrun air conditioning units a more efficient and costeffective use of natural gas than running electric generators they argue But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and relandscaping so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic Disagreements aside the consensus is that the states power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option We dont expect natural gas usage to decline If anything we may see an increase said Lance Horton marketing director for Peoples Gas Co At the end of the day the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before Staff Writer David Fleshler contributed to this report Antonio Fins can be reached at PHOTO

Copyright Polaroid Corp one of Massachusetts moststoried innovators sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the yearold Cambridge instantphotography legend The company that helped define Route as Americas Technology Highway slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in when it employed nearly It has local operations in Bedford Cambridge New Bedford Norton Norwood Waltham and Wayland Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut jobs and reduce its work force to Yesterday the company said it will cut more Its been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy How such a place with so much success and so much technology could lose that much money and get into so much debt I dont understand said Lloyd Taylor a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company A lot of people Ive known both retirees and some that are still there are just totally demoralized Polaroid founded by visionary Edwin H Land in said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instantfilm products even as it accelerates and intensifies its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection But it will slash operations with an unspecified number of job cuts expected Anything thats not part of its core business products that rely on instant film is subject to sale or elimination That includes the companys sunglass division its photo identification business and others Polaroid already selling off real estate and other assets will seek to sell more and will shutter plants Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans I think everythings on the table he said Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former US employees A federal bankruptcy judge authorized million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well and to honor service warranties on products In its filing Polaroid listed billion in assets and million in debt Top creditors include Enron Energy Services Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US all with multi million dollar claims As expected Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for million in socalled debtorinpossession financing from a bank group led by JP Morgan Chase Co Polaroid will seek court approval to use million of that loan Monday to meet obligations including paying suppliers on or after yesterdays filing Lawyers also said Polaroid had a million offer for its identification business Crushed by the weight of its debt including about million owed to bondholders and in bank loans Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets Its oncemighty instantfilm business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digitalimaging technologies Earlier this year Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology codenamed Opal and Onyx designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land its founder and visionary who stepped down as chief executive in and as chairman in Land died in A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrapmetal dealer Land began to research light

shortly the UAE Offsets Group UOG said Sunday The development and production sharing agreement DPSA with Qatar Petroleum QP is due to be signed shortly UOG said in a statement The staterun UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project Over the coming weeks the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December One of them is scheduled to be selected in early UOG said UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors Conoco ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States BP International and the AngloDutch firm Shell to replace the US firm Enron Corp which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its percent stake to UOG Enrons role was to build a kilometre mile pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi Dubai Oman and eventually Pakistan In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to billion dollars the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars lpdab Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY NATURAL GAS BIG IN STATES FUTURE NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS Antonio Fins Business Writer South Florida SunSentinel Broward Metro H Copyright by the SunSentinel Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals natural gas is set to become a major player in Floridas energy grid The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade natural gas will account for percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities up from about percent now Utility companies use percent of the natural gas burned in Florida As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas miles off Floridas coast other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area Enron Corp of Houston is proposing to spend as much as million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades Enrons proposal is drawing rivals El Paso Corp also in Houston wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach And AES Corp has purchased Ocean Cay a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups Ultimately federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed Still electric companies which are proposing to build more than new power plants in Florida through are looking to make heavy use of natural gas Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas said Michael Haff an engineer at the PSC Thats the reason for the large increase in projections of natural gas usage All this is quite a change for Floridas electric utilities For decades power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Floridas power plants than to pipe in natural gas Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida Most users are small factories public laundries and restaurants where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because its easier to control the heat With little need for heating homes in winter residential use has generally been limited to barbecues water heaters and stoves Consequently Florida uses far less natural gas than many states Household use of natural gas is less than onefifth of what some households in other parts of the country use The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors The federal Clean Air act signed into law in is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators Natural gas is one of those options Alvaro Linero the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection said natural gas emits no particulate matter the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions Unlike oil or coal it gives off no sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions a key component of smog when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal Florida Power Light Co the largest of the electric companies has already heavily invested in natural gas generators of its nonnuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money but the utility regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability By natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico is finished Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the BahamastoFlorida pipeline projects as well Still some environmental groups say that while they want cleaner energy they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks Enron which applied to build a BahamastoFlorida pipeline said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe But Broward officials and a conservationist group Hollywoodbased Save Our Shores have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad NM last year killing people the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters stoves and even gasrun air conditioning units a more efficient and costeffective use of natural gas than running electric generators they argue But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and relandscaping so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic Disagreements aside the consensus is that the states power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option We dont expect natural gas usage to decline If anything we may see an increase said Lance Horton marketing director for Peoples Gas Co At the end of the day the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before Staff Writer David Fleshler contributed to this report Antonio Fins can be reached at PHOTO

Copyright Polaroid Corp one of Massachusetts moststoried innovators sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company

define Route as Americas Technology Highway slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in when it employed nearly It has local operations in Bedford Cambridge New Bedford Norton Norwood Waltham and Wayland Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut jobs and reduce its work force to Yesterday the company said it will cut more Its been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy How such a place with so much success and so much technology could lose that much money and get into so much debt I dont understand said Lloyd Taylor a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company A lot of people Ive known both retirees and some that are still there are just totally

eg additional security personne l and some are phasing in While not all of the changes will be visible there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities In all th e steps we take and recommendations we make we will be making our faciliti es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi ty while doing our best to minimize disruption to our daytoday business Primary responsibility for Enron Corp Security resides in our business con trols organization You can contact this organization through their websit e security by phone or by email mailto John B rindle Senior Director Business Controls leads this organization Pleas e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions or to report security threats We have two areas to update you on changes in the access procedures for t he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory Access to the Enron Center Over the next few days the following access control procedures will be ins tituted at the Enron Center and other facilities where practical As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center US drivers license US or foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identif ication Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca rd Adult visitors without a valid photo ID US drivers license US o r foreign passport or some form of US federal state or local identifica tion will not be allowed access to the Enron Center Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b adged contractor at all times Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo yee or badged contractor signed into a visitors log at the lobby receptio n area by the employee or badged contractor and escorted to their appointm ent At the conclusion of the appointment the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor the visitor badge collected and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines report suspicious activity to Secu rity phone do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y ou or hold doors open allowing tail gating by others These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit uted at Enron We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi pment we expect the inconvenience to decrease We hope you understand the se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees Travel Advisory Update With the beginning of retaliatory strikes we have two important recommenda tions While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing corporate security recommend s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided We continue to str ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan Yemen Pak istan Indonesia Iran Iraq Sudan Somalia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Geo rgia and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled In addition we recommend that planned travel to Egypt Israel GazaWest Bank Jordan Lebanon Saudi Ara bia Syria and Algeria be very carefully considered For nonUS citizens traveling in the United States corporate securit y recommends that you carry documentation There have been several recent reports of nonUS citizens who reside in the United States being question ed and asked for documentation when boarding US domestic flights As a re sult we suggest that all nonUS citizens who currently reside in the Uni ted States and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status carry th eir passport Form I and Form I at all times We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident Green Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure It appears that Immi gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National ity Act that requires individuals over the age of to carry hisher regi stration documentation with them at all times This can include a Permanen t Resident Card Form I card Employment Authorization Card Border Cros sing Card or a Temporary Resident Card Immigration Officials have not his torically been asking domestic travelers for registration documentation but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c urrent lawful status We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor ate Security website and by email as appropriate,kitchen-l,President

The annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is based upon ENAs reported value of approximately The prorata credit for months assuming a sale date would be Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal Gathering these values within Enron normally requires to days We use these same values in the allocation system Unless the value change is significant the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted If we internally adjust your allocation midyear we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program As you know the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel We have not tried this before however I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENAs allocation all the other operating entities would want to resubmit their revised values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment In view of the time required this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron In view of the relatively small numbers I doubt that Corp would entertain this proposition either however we can approach them if you wish Original Message From Redmond Brian Sent Tuesday October AM To Clayton

Bouillion James L Subject RE Replacement Cost Values Brian This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage Values are adjusted annually at renewal The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured In the event of a significant divestiture underwriters may consider a refund however the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enrons values as a whole Additionally Enrons adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures At renewal North Americas revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enrons overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron Regards Paul Original Message From Redmond Brian Sent Monday October PM To Coffey Jr Jim

Fourth Year Business Wire Copyright c Business Wire NEW YORKBUSINESS WIREOct LowerProfile Women Topple More Wellknown Names From Tech and Internet Sector Ranking Includes Newcomers Though HewlettPackard lost billion in market value in a year CEO Carly Fiorina hasnt lost her nerve and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No position on FORTUNEs ranking of the Most Powerful Women in Business The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October issue of FORTUNE available on newsstands October and at wwwfortunecom at pm on October In the No spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman who runs an Internet company that actually makes money million in the last four quarters on million in revenue Oprah Winfrey the Queen of Media is mightier than ever and holds the No spot up from No last year She produces movies brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers propels books to bestsellerdom and last year teamed up with Hearst Magazines Cathie Black No on the list to publish O The Oprah Magazineby some measures the most successful magazine startup ever At No is Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon who has breathed life into ailing Avon Mirant CEO Marce Fullerthe only newcomer in the top fiveholds the No position Inside a stodgy utility Southern Fuller built a highgrowth trading and marketing unit which was spun off in April In these new more tempered times patience may be about to reap its reward In FORTUNEs annual survey of the Most Powerful Women in Business there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in Patient But Not Passive the story that accompanies the list By patience we mean staying with a company steadily building influence there and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge not promises and selfpromotion Fiorina who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNEs inaugural list in heads the biggest company billion in revenues last year run by a woman And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever Wall Street practically heckled her latest movea bold bet to buy Compaqbut Fiorina remains defiant In difficult times people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny she says As always the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time Last year power resided in the technology and Internet sectors but that influence was fleeting Gone from the list this year Deborah Hurricane Debby Hopkins who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May Ellen Hancock who failed at the startup Exodus and Morgan Stanleys Mary Meeker who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz But one Web warrior looks better than ever Meg Whitman No on the list She has never overpromised to investors instead she has diligently delivered abovetarget profits every single quarter Fourteen newcomers join the list this year Marce Fuller President CEO Mirant Louise Kitchen COO Enron Americas Colleen Barrett President COO Southwest Airlines

Raytheon While the economy and its points of power change the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same Says Sellers We consider the size and importance of a womans business in the global economy her clout inside her company and the arc of her careerwhere she has been and where she is likely to go When appropriate we also weigh the womans influence on mass culture and society That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No on this years list The shifts on our list this year are dramatic with newcomers But one trend is especially intriguing Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever A few years ago responsibility for a billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list No more This years FORTUNE includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of billion or more which is a first In a related story It Took a Lady To Save Avon Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung Chairman and CEO of Avon Says Brooker Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them And thats what has made her one of the most successful CEOsmale or femalein recent years Over the past months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business how it advertises manufactures packages and even sells its products and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady but by reviving her The result growth in revenues operating profits and operating margins In addition FORTUNE includes an international list of the powerful women in business The top ten featured in the magazine are Marjorie Scardino CEO Pearson Britain Anne Lauvergeon Chairman Areva France Mary Ma Senior VP CFO Legend Hong Kong Marianne Nivert President CEO Telia Sweden Lien SiaouSze Vice President HewlettPackard Hong Kong Patricia Barbizet CEO Artemis

Richter Brad Sent Monday October PM To Kitchen Louise Subject TrueQuote update FYI see the trail below The value prop is low and the related workload and risk are high bad deal Id like your thoughts if you get a minute Thanks for an engaging budget discussion last week Brad Original Message From Richter Brad Sent Monday October AM To Piper Greg Whalley Greg Cc Shults Bob Webb Jay Pickering Mark Subject RE Opportunity to take on ICE CONFIDENTIAL Update from EOL Team I just spoke with Chris Edmonds There are basic things he is requesting of Enron TQ receives the right to sell APIs with limited EOL transactability Brokers would be allowed to transact on EOL numbers through TQ site Enron would post more products and terms on their site The term of our Agreement would extend an additional months I told him that we have not yet reached strategic closure on selling APIs or continuing Broker Client internally Even if we decided to pursue those activities I explained that the value proposition for Enron doing it on its own was considerably more than TQ was offering us I made it clear that I was not going to drop everything and work on our API strategy just so that TrueQuote could get on with their business model I characterized the additional product and extended term requests as subsets of the first two and therefore also off the table I basically told him no and he said he would confer with Dennis and call back later in the week Please let me know if you have any questions Brad Original Message From Piper Greg Sent Friday September PM To Whalley Greg Cc Richter Brad Shults Bob Webb Jay Pickering Mark Subject FW Opportunity to take on ICE CONFIDENTIAL Update from EOL Team Got the email Chris Edmonds from TrueQuote sent to you First Brad Richter and Bob Shults know Chris well and are calling him today to let him know that we understand his request to you and that we will finalize a response to him early next week We completed the link to them as per our legal commitment earlier in the year and send to them the products we are required to as per the contract Bottom line we are absolutely honoring our contract with them However they want to do more and that is what we are considering Now some history As you know TrueQuote was supposed to be a robust manytomay site and function more like ICE does today Well it doesnt It is basically a front end for EOL prices As of trades have occurred for Enron at True Quote and the majority of those have been PGE an owner In August it averaged trades a day and in September trade a day Issues arose a few months ago with them when they realized that they were struggling to be a true manytomany exchange and wanted to sell APIs as TrueQuote to other companies This concerned us greatly since we felt per our contract with them that this was a technical and security issue for us Webb did not like it all for system security issues and we have a right in the agreement to say no because of that We also talked to other companies about an API to EOL and they said they were just going to get one from TrueQuote and that concerned us as well since the only thing at TrueQuote is our prices The broker portion is that they want to act like broker client As you know the gas desks are indifferent to broker client but East Power does not like it for reasons I can explain later if you wish Therefore they want to escalate broker client at a time when we are considering its costbenefit for Enron Finally if Dynegy puts prices there as well that may be helpful to our equity but I dont think it is a high priority for EA as a trading company I discussed all this with Louise a month ago and I believe she supports our path I will check with her and Lavo Monday to make sure they are in agreement with any response we give to Chris Let me know if you need more info or want me to check with you as well before we respond to TrueQuote Thanks Greg Piper Original Message From Taylor Liz M Sent Friday September PM To

Friday September PM To Greg Whalley Email Cc Dennis Crum Email Subject FW Opportunity to take on ICE CONFIDENTIAL Greg I need your guidance regarding a few issues currently outstanding with respect to the True Quote EnronOnline relationship Practically speaking Enrons internal decisions will determine the fate of True Quote in its current form I will outline the issues below and await your response We are closing in on a deal that will connect DynegyDirect to the True Quote platform We believe True Quote would have a strong competitive advantage against ICE if we have a commitment from Enron and DynegyDirect We are hestitant to move forward with Dynegy until we have a complete understanding of our relationship with Enron True Quote has made a proposal to EnronOnline that would create a revenue stream to Enron in return for a larger product commitment from Enron We are waiting on a response from Enron True Quote needs the ability for brokers to transact with Enron through the True Quote interface We have agreed to the same terms and conditions as the BrokerClient product offering We are waiting on feedback from Enron We are confident True Quote would be greatly successful if we could execute the strategies outlined above We want to have a winwin relationship with Enron that allows us to shape the marketplace and compete aggressively against ICE Due to the critical nature of these discussions and the associated timing I chose to write you and ask for your guidance Right now we need to know which direction Enron plans to take Regardless of the direction our time is running

Christine Sent Monday November AM To Bajwa Bilal Alon Heather Fortunov Gallin Rohmer Gisselle Subject FW Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call This was forwarded to me this morning Someones notes from the call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model uhoh They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x,kitchen-l,President

seating as we will be living on floors of the Enron South building I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large

please help him with his requirements I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list Communication I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are I am asking David Oxley to coordinate with all of you on this I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have

but I presume its the same Original Message From Yanowski Tommy J SentWednesday January PM ToPerlman Beth Johnson Jeff Stock Steve McAuliffe Bob CcWebb Jay Burchfield Richard Beck Sally Piper Greg Kitchen Lo uise Hedstrom Peggy Koehler Anne C Redmond Brian SubjectIT Back Office Service Agreements Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties Beth has expressed some concerns about the e states ability to be able to support a production trading environment onc e a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements Here are some suggestions Peggy Hedstrom in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Ser vices agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity Bridgeline which is a JV in which ENA owns a interest currently has n o way that they can support themselves They are totally dependent on Enro n for everything from email internet network services and office applicat ions as well as trading risk and back office applications If there are c oncerns about the estates ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enrons best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO AEPHPL is more of a stand alone operation They have their own infrastruc ture in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA sy stem and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter Open Link Financials and Altra Their goal w as to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and sugges t that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information fro m one system to another until they have put in their own integration betwee n the applications listed above Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put tog ether a meeting to

Test Planning Coordination Mtg Summary Key Planning Assumptions Jan go live New Co Conversions must be completed and tested by application teams by Jan This assumes all major production data setup users rights books global data is completed and tested on a per application basis Some co de changes may still be in process but integration testing can begin to ens ure the applications still talk to each other Integration test planning focus will be to run representative transactio ns from EOL to SAP through all core trading applications to ensure that app lications and interfaces still work We will not be testing functional perm utations data conditions validation or exceptions to any significant degr ee Each application conversion team must test their changes before approvin g their changes for integration testing We are operating from the premise that data infrastructure and code changes have been tested at a applicatio n system level before the enterprise integration test starts All systems will be physically split even Unify at this point Integration test team will develop and execute the test plan for both Es tate and New Co We will integrate key business reps into the process for planning and ex ecution and they will have shared responsibility for signoff on the test to support go live to production We will minimize the differentiation between New Co and Estate for conve rsion and test team purposes There are two teams Conversion and Integrat ion Test Each team will focus on both Estate and New Co Resources are too tight and the process is too inefficient to separate responsibility Estate conversions must happen at the application level before New Co co nversion work can begin in earnest Estate conversion is on the critical pa th for New Co Key Issues We will push to get a decision to see if we can focus on financial tradi ng first then physical If financial is the focus delivery risk goes down dramatically For now we must plan on the worst case physical and fina ncial on Jan We need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support A EP and Bridgeline in Estate This means that we need a dev environment and HW gap addressed for Unify Sitara CPR TAGGERMS Conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure w ere in synch Unify servers probably cant be owned by New Co while running a single l icense of Unify Some systems are using short name instead of Duns ID as a key for coun terparties from Global The Global TAGG ERMS Unify and SAP reps must qu ickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizin g hard coded reference id risks We must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates We must focus on core systems with only core changes requi red to support day one trading We can only convert Estate over the weekend due to AEP Bridgeline cons iderations The time window will be very small Core Conversion Team Steve

Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative senior unsecured debt BBB subordinated debt BBB preferred stock BBB and commercial paper F Pipeline subsidiary A rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co and Transwestern Pipeline Co are also placed on Rating Watch Negative The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company The loss of investor and counterparty confidence if it continues would impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital markets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business On Oct Enron announced a billion aftertax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of and a reduction of balance sheet equity by billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions Since that time there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management More importantly investors have voiced concerns Enrons common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business Approximately billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind While various sources of repayment exist such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets or an equity offering primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case Enron is required to deliver additional shares If Enron cannot or does not deliver on its obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim While trigger events include a downgrade of Enrons senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enrons closing stock price over three consecutive trading days Enron would have a forebearance period of days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately billion Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the

DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings New York By Mark Golden Kristen McNamara Jon Kamp and John Edmiston Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow JonesEnergy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp ENE but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas the companies said Thursday The concerns have arisen because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron said John Sousa chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc DYN Its business as usual Williams Cos WMB spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company too has made no changes and has no concerns about Enrons credit Another Top power and gas trading company Aquila ILA has also left Enron credit unchanged Other companies expressed concern though theyve taken little if any action Like everyone else in the marketplace were proceeding with caution said Lora Kinner director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel SA Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesnt expect to make any drastic changes Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos WMB to book million in power sales from the previous period as thirdquarter revenues the company said Thursday The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions The state of California has paid more than billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in midJanuary Two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back Its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday Williams reported thirdquarter net income of million on revenues of billion up from million on revenues of billion in the same period the year before Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales The process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves The ISO didnt envision thirdparty guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month state power officials have said The state says it has set aside billion to cover ISO transactions As reported suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free Willing To Renegotiate Separately Williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its longterm contracts with California

guest market commentator Maybe Kernen Yeah right Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer Go ahead say it Say what youre thinking No one has said it yet We know the truth We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze They knew every single number in this gas situation They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it Thats my bet My bet that thisthey hadlook they were the market maker Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someonewhen the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen Lets see what happened Haines Now wait a second David Faber coanchor Whoa whoa whoa The Justice Department Jim Now is that new Is that something Cramer No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber OK so they are not being investigated Cramer Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr Faber Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen Well lets talk about the actual news Heres yesterdays trading Haines Wait a minute Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here Did you readdid you know that Fastow after four Faber Late yesterday Kernen Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone Whats interesting Faber Hes the CFO Kernen But hes a new CFO Faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer This is my theory Haines OK Cramer It is just a theory It is my opinion But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines OK Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber Well what they need to do Joe they need to come clean I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to goif their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen I guess you would wouldnt you Faber Right Not that they arent but why would youif you can trade with seven other guysseven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen Now why would Faber And that would hurt their core business Kernen Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel Faber Because of something related to these liabilities they may have Kernen That they dont know about at this point Faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership Will it be a liability They dont know But thats one of the reasons Kernen Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber They dont know Kernen But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber Yes About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen This is a pretty big number Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks You got to look at here But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron Now were at sixteen Faber Everybody else took a hit yesterday Dynegy got hurt Kernen Well I got Dynegy next Dont Here we go Faber Im sorry Im getting a little excited Kernen You are Faber Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you Now Im worried about the utility average Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries Im angstridden Did you see this chart Were breaking below the Cramer Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen Whats wrong with Cramer today What happened Cramer Im all fired up Faber He really is My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA You going down to Enyou going down to Houston yourself Cramer I may just have to I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen Jim why would thethats thenow getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the postattack lows the utilities are retesting those Thats not something to worry about Cramer No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues I think the economy is showing signs of getting better The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong Much stronger than before Kernen All right In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though I dontwere talking about four hundred to twoninety at this point Thats a long way Cramer This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that Kernen Its no longer the Cramer you sell this as safety We dont want safety as much

drawn the scrutin y of the Securities and Exchange Commission In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO Kenneth L Lay Enrons chairman and chief executive said in a statement announcing the change Only one day before Mr Lay had told in vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy The company said that Mr Fastow had taken a leave of absence but it also named his successor Jeffrey McMahon the head of Enrons industrial market s group and a former corporate treasurer Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange wh ere Enrons shares fell to The price has been cut in half si nce Oct when Enron reported its thirdquarter earnings A billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi th partnerships that Mr Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning s news release Mr Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo llowed but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings document and were angered wh en they later learned about it On Tuesday when both Mr Fastow and Mr Lay discussed the company with ana lysts on the conference call neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr Fastow Mr Lay cited the SEC inquiry in declining to discuss the detai ls of the transactions The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year but Enrons disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n ot lead to reported losses but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement That is one of the issues the SEC whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company is expected t o address Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying either i n cash or with stock if things went wrong On Tuesday Mr Fastow assure d investors that the company expects to continue to have sufficient liqui dity to meet normal obligations and said it had bank credit lines that w ere more than adequate Mr Fastow was viewed as one of the architects with Jeffrey K Skilling t he former Enron chief executive who resigned in

yesterday afternoon the lowest pri ce for the stock since early before recovering In afterhours tradin g they fell to One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M Carol Coale an analyst at Prudential Securities to drop her rating to sell from hold She had lowered the rating to hold from buy on Mond ay After the SEC inquiry was announced she said in an interview yester day evening Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat as a gesture to the Street Now they are replacing him today The timing is a little late but I think it will be received positively by

management Investors have already had enough issues in corporate bonds recently and sometimes investors just think Not another nasty in my portfolio and Id rather exit For certain investors maybe they just get scared I wanted to know more about it People had speculated if it could go to junk I dont think they could because I dont think Enron could exist as a junk company Theres a certain reluctance

All Rights Reserved HOUSTON AP Enron Corp may have added another question to the list inve stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha nge Commission inquiry It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC Prudential Securities Inc analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday W ho knows Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giants stocks have declined in value each day since Mon days announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a s CFO Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon wh o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enrons Industrial Markets group takes over his role I think change is good at this particular point in time said FAC Equitie s analyst Robert Christensen said I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered AG Edwards Sons analyst Mike Heim however said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements Heim s aid Replacing Fastow alone wont clarify those arrangements he added There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans parent to the financial community Heim said Instead of being more trans parent there is more confusion than ever Enrons stock continued to plummet Wednesday closing down to per share a percent decline Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week Enrons stock price has slid nearly percent The market was asking for that to happen JP Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg in said of Fastows departure This is really the first time Enron has act ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis Previously Enrons managers have been cautious and defensive in their app roach he said During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles The partnerships have sin ce been dissolved The call didnt work for many including Feygin and Heim I didnt hear things like weve unrolled all these partnership dealings or heres all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we dont ever expect to take any more charges Heim said What I heard is we dont hav e to disclose that information until the Q is filed The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry third qu arter losses and the August resignation of the companys chief executive of ficer Jeff Skilling have left many analysts questioning the companys fut ure Heim said Its really a speculative bet right now but the odds favor the company be ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro m now two years from now he said But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors F eygin said Feygin said McMahon worked as Enrons treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastows involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer Internally Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in the

Likely they will point to McMahons a lleged opposition to Fastows role in the big hedging deal called LJM to show that the Fastow era is over The Wall Street Journal citing anonym ous sources reported

energy trading bu siness makes money Its hard to believe the LJM deals were done in isolat ion and without the knowledge of the board In fact the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t he LJM transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad band business The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f rom being in broadband so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM as a way to hedge that volatility away This meant LJM entered agreements that gave it acce ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t he downside Should the whole board be on the hook too The spokeswoman re sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the markets views Arguably thats downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish shortterm financing Letting

makes it pretty difficult to understand where we are answering each question Is this a style we use with FERC If so fine But if not heres my attempt I hav e changed quite a few answers too Question In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen t or management would you please provide an explanation to the following W e understand that EOL requires that a counter party before accessing EOL to do business with Enron North America must undergo a credit worthiness evaluation When a counter party executes or clicks on a price EOL does an instant credit check before confirming the transaction However Enron may not only buy from a counter party it may sell What so rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi ng EOL to purchase from Enron Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter party credit risk that Enron uses If yes may we have copies If Enron utilizes its own agreements please provide us with a copy All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline Enron as the principal t o all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the telephone or in writing requires counterparties to be creditworthy I n addition Enrons risk management process is required to be approved by the Enron Board of Directors according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company Enrons risk policies are provided in Enron s publicly available Q audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC Enron maintains a separate risk management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the Chairman of Enron Corp and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded In addition every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th ey can transact through EnronOnline The Credit Risk Management group approve s a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd ed within the EnronOnline database Every transaction is passed through an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a re not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterpartys bid or offer vi a EnronOnline such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma n intervention As with all Enron transactions the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually EnronOnline doe s provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits No further transactions are executed unless CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha t credit limit is still available EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into whether we are buying or selling The transactions entered into on EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Terms and Conditions which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity these are all available on the website A Master Agreeme nt is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater al credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on EnronOnline The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online should the counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract for credit or other reasons the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee n the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them Question I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system However does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled If yes does EOL collect use or manage data regarding cookies It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customers mouse is EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled Question Also why doesnt EOL publish a ticker of completed trades showing prices and quantities Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data If yes when There are now several options for viewing historical pricingtransaction da ta from EnronOnline Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline enrononlinequotes which also provides customer s with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they acquire access In addition EnronOnline provides a number of online chart s for products which graphically depict historical transaction prices Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t he results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline The system also allows fo r administrative users thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t o monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with their own systems Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices For example Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place this will commence on July At the end of each day EnronOnline makes available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price o f that days transactions The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent i n this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index Question In addition how does the data collection from EOLEnron Networks flow to the risk management groups How is the information used EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depending on the type of commodity transacted For example the group that handles US gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australian Power The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office utilizing a bridge a process that is capable of communicat ing transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates Th e potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the customer with more efficient recording of the transaction The back office systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions such as invoicing preparation of financial statements risk management and credit These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources including EnronOnline the telephone other trading systems etc Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and regulatory rules regardless of the source of the transaction The Enron commercial employee who is offering to buy or to sell through EnronOnline does so through a price management software application this notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed The counterparty the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi ed by the system at the same time The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron When a transaction is completed EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture syste m that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems It does however automate our deal capture system which improves the data feeds to our settlement and credit systems Question Also we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL If yes in what form and for how long EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database The transactions are bridged duplicated onto the various systems databases managing the underlying commodity the risk system associated with the commodity We currently intend to store the data for a period of six year s post a transaction completing for example deliveries finishing and this is policy across all databases In general EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free realtime pricing information for approximately products for commodities including electricity and natural gas EnronOnline utilizes ecommerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously took place on the telephone and by fax EnronOnline is a proprietary or onetomany trading platform On a onetomany platform one entity such as Enron is the principal to every trade unlike a br oker type platform EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t he second Buyers or sellers can also see realtime price spreads of both the sell price and the buy price For example on the telephone a buyer previously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six months but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices some price s could have changed EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the bid a nd offer prices all the time to make more informed decisions The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC has enforcement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police f or potential manipulation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulatory authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale The CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives swaps and options Moreover pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act CEA Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules Such transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract Participants ECPsgenerally corporations partnerships and other entities that meet net worth or asset tests EnronOnline is a proprietary bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a principal to every trade As such EnronOnline is not a trading facili ty as defined under the CFMA As a proprietary platform EnronOnline uses Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro n and its customers From Lisa NRON on PM To Steven J nron Richard nron Linda NRON

makes it pretty difficult to understand where we are answering each question Is this a style we use with FERC If so fine But if not heres my attempt I hav e changed quite a few answers too Question In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessmen t or management would you please provide an explanation to the following W e understand that EOL requires that a counter party before accessing EOL to do business with Enron North America must undergo a credit worthiness evaluation When a counter party executes or clicks on a price EOL does an instant credit check before confirming the transaction However Enron may not only buy from a counter party it may sell What so rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizi ng EOL to purchase from Enron Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter party credit risk that Enron uses If yes may we have copies If Enron utilizes its own agreements please provide us with a copy All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline Enron as the principal t o all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the telephone or in writing requires counterparties to be creditworthy I n addition Enrons risk management process is required to be approved by the Enron Board of Directors according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company Enrons risk policies are provided in Enron s publicly available Q audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC Enron maintains a separate risk management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the Chairman of Enron Corp and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded In addition every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before th ey can transact through EnronOnline The Credit Risk Management group approve s a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedd ed within the EnronOnline database Every transaction is passed through an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits a re not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterpartys bid or offer vi a EnronOnline such credit checks are done automatically and there is no huma n intervention As with all Enron transactions the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually EnronOnline doe s provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits No further transactions are executed unless CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such tha t credit limit is still available EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into whether we are buying or selling The transactions entered into on EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Terms and Conditions which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity these are all available on the website A Master Agreeme nt is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilater al credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on EnronOnline The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online should the counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract for credit or other reasons the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact betwee n the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them Question I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system However does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled If yes does EOL collect use or manage data regarding cookies It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customers mouse is EnronOnline does not

historical transaction prices Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download t he results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline The system also allows fo r administrative users thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties t o monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with their own systems Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices For example Enron does

Paul it is very helpful I attach below for completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on EnronOnline There are two remaining issues which require further thought How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline For the short term we can put credit out there but the number of updates will be restricted Using Jays best guess on a slow network connection th e initialization process will take upto minutes and on a normal connection updates every seconds would prevent people from trading So we do have some scaling issues Our model doesnt really function for simultaneou se changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much better specific on how many updates you envisage Do you really envisage that many updates Also we havent yet experienced fast updates which we will do when FX joins the system We have approximately guest id and passwords Can these see credi t pricing from a due diligence perspective Elena

Justin CT Rod CT Janine CT Mark CT Rick CT Steve W CT Shirl ey A CT David CT David CT Elena CT Subject Credit Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me mo NOTE GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the

attach below for completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on EnronOnline There are two remaining issues which require further thought How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline For the short term we can put credit out there but the number of updates will be restricted Using Jays best guess on a slow network connection th e initialization process will take upto minutes and on a normal connection updates every seconds would prevent people from trading So we do have some scaling issues Our model doesnt really function for simultaneou se changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much better specific on how many updates you envisage Do you really envisage that many updates Also we havent yet experienced fast updates which we will do when FX joins the system We have approximately guest id and passwords Can these see credi t pricing from a due diligence perspective Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline

LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit y see b above is relatively remote Please feel

until Monday about the direction they are taking While they are excited about the application and confident that it will work well they have some concerns that there will be issues when they first go live that they would prefer to deal with somewhat quietly Put another way they are leaning towards being lowkeyed until they are confident the system IS working very well ie it has been live for a bit as opposed to BELIEVINGHOPING it will work well and making a big deal BEFORE it goes live I know Im somewhat conservative in these matters but that makes a whole lot of sense to me At this point let

a final project performance review Regarding the invoice As we discussed when the soft launch invoice went out with some disputed rates we scrubbed all past invoices to ensure we were using the proper rates In those instances where the rates were higher than the contract we have made adjustments to credit Enron the excess on the final invoice This adjustment took into consideration all incorrect rates from the beginning of the project In those cases where the rates were lower than the contract we have taken no action other than to charge the proper rates for the period from the soft launch invoice to the final invoice For the period prior to the soft launch invoice we have left them at the lower rate This is as we discussed The total credit as a result of this analysis is approximately Additionally we did some analysis of the turnover on the project and rampup time for the replacements We have included a credit of on the final invoice to help defray these costs Regarding Project Performance Review Darrell Balmer who reports to Chan and is our EVP Employee and Client Satisfaction and I would like to meet with you and whoever you think appropriate to discuss AGENCYCOMs

first Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic trading exchanges in the energy industry Enron Net Works the division which operates EnronOnline last week signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote LLC And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar deals with several other exchanges including Houstonbased Altra Energy Technologies and RedMeteor as well as eSpeed an exchange backed by Dynegy and Williams HoustonStreet Exchange headquartered in Portsmouth NH was recently ranked among the top dependent energy exchanges by AMR Research a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place True Quote based in Louisville Ky a startup trading platform being developed by APB Energy an overthecounter brokerage firm along with PGE National Energy Group EnForm Technology and Microsoft Corp EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform but users an only trade with Enron Rather than being a true trading exchange industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enrons business But in EnronOnlines first six months of operation after being launched last November the value of transactions conducted on the system surpassed billion at a rate of billion a day The platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities from most forms of energy to bandwidth and paper MORE EYEBALLS The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on HousonStreetcom and TrueQuotecom Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote prices however will appear on EnronOnline Customers on those two sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to EnronOnline where the trades will take place As Louise Kitchen president of EnronOnline said extending their pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron says Paul Bourke president of Altra The question is whether it will build volume for the other exchanges We are talking to Enron Bourke adds We are intrigued and we are attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be He says an EnronAltra deal would be more complicated than those involving other exchanges because of Altras significant liquidity in natural gas Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading While none of the exchanges would reveal what if any financial terms are involved in the agreementsother than to say there is no sharing of commissions Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an agreement Enron would take a small equity position in Altra He speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet Brian Pieri vice president of Red Meteor says the value of EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that they bring tightbid offers which is something the exchanges have to work hard on And more people will make the bid offers even tighter This means buy and sell prices are close together which helps market liquidity Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might bring to the other exchanges wouldnt just further fragment the market Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixthgrade dance The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the other side and nobody is dancing Somebody has to start and then everybody else joins in Enron brings more validity to this very new situation Pied says All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity of which Enron is the king says Bill Swanton an analyst with AMR Research Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the next six to eight months and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not be owned by any single player You need an independent exchange I cant imagine Enron will end up running it The trading community wont be satisfied with that he says Swanton points out however that Enron will attract attention they dont want if they force some of these guys out of business But HoustonStreets CEO Frank Getman takes a different view of what the Enron deals mean Webbased energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity thanks to these EnronOnline

American trader representatives on raising the awareness of the project he aims to have details on the products by the end of this week He has also worked on highlighting the requirements such as staffing and space which need to be pushed in peoples minds early in this project to prepare for launch Both of the above will be coordinating feeback sessions with the trader groups on the prototype in approximately weeks Business Process We now have a fairly substantial team in place for the Business Process side of the project Europe David Port Process Leader Bryan SeyfriedDavid Weekes Control Credit Janine Juggins Tax US David Mally Process Leader Bill Bradford Control Credit Tax TBA David Port is leading the way with scoping out the Business Process side of the project and plans to have completed substantial documentation by the end of this week He will be coordinating with Dave Mally and a roundtable meeting on the Business Process implementation will be held in the next two weeks in the Houston office From the OnLine team itself the Business Process is being helped by Arfan Aziz who is currently tasked with creating a counterparty database to facilitate the process of enabling counterparties to trade on the system PR The approach to developing the site has been agreed with Mark Palmer We have instructed the agency that they are to abide by the guidelines for the Enron Logo and get a feel for the Enron style through the intranet pages although allowing them fairly free rein with the site initially up to prototype and under Pauls watch to use their creative approach to creating the site Out of interest I spent time with the Design Director this afternoon and the actual sites they have produced are pretty impressive here are some examples if you are interested wwwbritishairwayscom wwwsprintcom wwwbenettoncom Another site which I think offers some of the appeal we would need is wwwvwcom Apart from Marks involvement in the project he has also asked George Tzinas and Marge Nadasky from his team to assist in this project Legal and Regulatory US Legal Meeting held with Sullivan Cromwell They are happy with the overall structure of the site conceptually and offered several methods of tightening the process of binding a customer to the transaction on the Click and minimising the risks to Enron These are captured within their first draft of the agreements These are in first draft format only and have yet to be reviewed by Enron The concept we are working with currently for the US market are generic language formats to override current Masters The current format which is under review is the idea of an enabling agreement ie the piece of paper they sign to register and then a text book on screen to clock on when they enter the site I am thinking that we should work towards one document which is much simpler althoughslightly longer US Regulatory We will be involving Steve Kean and Cynthia Santer from his group in order to ensure that they remain up to speed with the project European Regulatory Work has kicked off on compiling the jurisdictional issues with regard to Europe We are facing an issue in that each commodity has one GTC and this is difficult for example German Power would be under German Law for German counterparties and English Law for English counterparties and we really need to have a default approximately

CT David CT Jay CT cc Subject Legal Meeting June Dear all these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention European Jurisdictions Peculiarities Slovenia Cpoatia Romania must be added to Phase reviews Products that considered are gas and power both physical and financial Jurisdictions reviews are already received So far they do not reveal any fundamental problems with the overall structure There are few recommendations on the wording of PAA ETA and GTC to come CC Tim Hueges is summarising all the replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions by Monday th lunch time Possible complications are All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into French and Spanish as part of these jurisdictions requirements Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking validity of signatures it may need to be reflected in the business processes It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well so that potential customers may print them out fill in and mail to Enron YES only in the garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement therefor it has to be drafted ASAP DRAFTING REQUIRED THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team Justin Boyd Mark Taylor but not CC or SC OK Timetable GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June First two weeks of July CC will spend validating marketing data Project timetable was promised to CC to be emailed yesterday OK but timings will vary on the basis of what timetable says Translation Translation of GTCs ETA and PPA will be done internally The first priority languages most likely will be French German and Spanish Actions Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP Justin Boyd to coordinate Identify languages to translate into Elena Kapralova to coordinate with Justin and traders Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions must be sent to Canada Janine Juggins to coordinate Web Page Wording The words I accept and Delete in the box that appears after a customer clicked on price are to be changed into Submit and Clear Lawyers are comfortable with this Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company for ex Morgan Stanley International MSI and Morgan Stanley MS they should be treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate System Administrator passwords This is necessary for tax considerations It is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per System Administrator Authorisation Risk Because Online Trading will be Enrons software all problems arising from authorisation errors for ex when customer that was supposedly authorised to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power will be entirely Enrons liability it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of authorisation functionality of the system in July and AugustNO this would only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view DAVID ISSUE Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating superiority of written vs electronic confirmations According to the UK law an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one generated and mailed by the Back Office similar to the current practice for transactions done over the telephone when phone conversation overwrites all paper conformations In the US the situation is opposite For the deals done over the phone written confirmations still take priority over the phone conversation tape In Texas anything that is not in writing is not enforceable The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be investigated further Mark Taylor to coordinate The result should be reflected in US version of ETA YES This leads to a further question whether sending written confirmations in UK is still necessaryYES UN ECommerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on ecommerce which currently has very strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete It requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc Enron might be in position to lobby few items in this Directive Justin and Regulatory Dept What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking two further stages than we have in our system WE need to build a system which can incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of deals in the same commodity It arises two issues IT the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the transaction summary page bottom of the price page YES Legal CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law NO PROBLEM BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS Price Check Idea Just a thought whether it is technically possible to amend a price check the one done when the customer submitted a price and database does credit GTC and price check in a way that customer is notified about the price change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron ie if price moved in Enrons favour transaction should go forward at the price customer had agreed to earlier Legally it is OK Jay can the system do it YES Internal Issues still to be addressed Global Liquids Books management ie how responsibilities for price update will be managed between London and Houston desksDAVID FX conversion including IT business processes tax risk managment issues

on how to register this is what we are doing Any comments or problems please reply I have tried to address everyones points see end of email Current Customers We are going to preregister a large number of customers prior to the launch These customers will not receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form Password Application and a nice glossy marketing brochure They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people Procedure A list of customers to be preregistered is compiled Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax Credit Legal etc The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form postal and a marketing brochure this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process to include whether to send to UK os US office The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty The customer signs the document Password Application and returns to Enron Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transacts If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodityproduct type Elenas questions Q Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the House No only in the garden PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden drop down box would be my suggestion New Customers There are two alternative routes possible Procedure Off Line Registration Potential Customer will email phone to express their willingness to trade online ie get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password Procedure Two Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose drop down box which jurisdiction he is in print out appropriate Registration Form and PA fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side Elenas questions Q Alternative or Both In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted YES In the garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion this is not just for Read Only its for all applications Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be availableYES Read Only Customers If a customer counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access We will no be advertising read only access as available They will be able to enter the site for a period for time Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customercounterparty is given readonly access for unable to transact but view only Procedure Either Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time or a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers The Product Control Group will issue a passwordlogin which will be time dated only valid for a certain period The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA these are to be country specific The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords not like a system administrator password When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices Elenas issues Should Read Only ETA be printable and where YES should be printable when it appears on screen at login no need for it to be in the garden What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User ie one log in session limited time etc This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July th Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access see above Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line but accepting it online should work as well and seems to be a cleaner wayNo this will be signedclicked online just like the ETAs Marks comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned If they are in reality that is none of our concern Agreed we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process we have legal confirmation of your comment I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it which I think is where Bob is coming from Only one person per System Administration Password Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday and I have some process queries on it See above How do we separate identify the applications See above What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process other queries Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically Need a Read Only ETA see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed where is this being coded and who by There will be a timetable impact This is not new and therefore isnt Bobs comments Existing Enron Customers approx The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users The first person logging on will always be the Administrator to set up his users so how can a probable nontrading user accept ETAs for his traders Probably will be a trader change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD MASTER TRADING PASSWORD Unknown Customers currently not trading with Enron willing to get Trading Access Alternative most closely mirrors what were doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control System Admin to run this If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas marketing pack will be signed off by legal business processes already there no extra development effort single point of reference The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form I think we do both alternatives Tims comments The process you have described is as I understood things except that for Guest Users also referred to as Read Only Users Regulators Lawyers Brokers Potential Traders etc As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday I understood the process to be as follows The Guest will phone or sent email possibly fill in a form online that will be automatically emailed to Enron System Administrator Customers will provide info on their name email address mailing address country of incorporation etc If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user the System Administrator will emailfax to the Guest the Read Only ETA The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron by fax or post Enron will then issue a Guest ID and

Capital Trade Resources Corp From To cc Elena KapralovaLONECT Mark ECT Legal TaylorHOUECT Edmund CooperLONECT bcc Louise KitchenLONECT Subject RE Registration Process Questions Louise Thank you for the below email It is good to clear up the confusion regarding this process At the end of the email you ask for our comments on the ROETA execution process We would prefer that the ROETA be executed offline It is on that basis that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel That said you may form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer On that basis you may decide to execute the ROETA online We have some concerns regarding security issues because of the distribution of a password without a supporting agreement however you may form the view that this is a minor risk If you have any other questions please do not hesitate contact me Regards Timothy Hughes Clifford Chance Aldersgate St ECA JJ London UK direct switch fax Original Message From SMTP Sent Monday July PM To Elena Kapralova Rahil Jafry Mark Dilworth Mark ECT Legal Taylor Jay Webb Robert Campbell Edmund Cooper David G Mally Subject Registration Process Questions Lets be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how to register this is what we are doing Any comments or problems please reply I have tried to address everyones points see end of email Current Customers We are going to preregister a large number of customers prior to the launch These customers will not receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form Password Application and a nice glossy marketing brochure They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people Procedure A list of customers to be preregistered is compiled Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax Credit Legal etc The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form postal and a marketing brochure this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process to include whether to send to UK os US office The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty The customer signs the document Password Application and returns to Enron Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transacts If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodityproduct type Elenas questions Q Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the House No only in the garden PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden drop down box would be my suggestion New Customers There are two alternative routes possible Procedure Off Line Registration Potential Customer will email phone to express their willingness to trade online ie get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password Procedure Two Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose drop down box which jurisdiction he is in print out appropriate Registration Form and PA fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side Elenas questions Q Alternative or Both In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted YES In the garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion this is not just for Read Only its for all applications Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be availableYES Read Only Customers If a customer counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access We will no be advertising read only access as available They will be able to enter the site for a period for time Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customercounterparty is given readonly access for unable to transact but view only Procedure Either Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time or a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers The Product Control Group will issue a passwordlogin which will be time dated only valid for a certain period The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA these are to be country specific The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords not like a system administrator password When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices Elenas issues Should Read Only ETA be printable and where YES should be printable when it appears on screen at login no need for it to be in the garden What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User ie one log in session limited time etc This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July th Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access see above Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line but accepting it online should work as well and seems to be a cleaner wayNo this will be signedclicked online just like the ETAs Marks comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned If they are in reality that is none of our concern Agreed we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process we have legal confirmation of your comment I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it which I think is where Bob is coming from Only one person per System Administration Password Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday and I have some process queries on it See above How do we separate identify the applications See above What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process other queries Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically Need a Read Only ETA see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed where is this being coded and who by There will be a timetable impact This is not new and therefore isnt Bobs comments Existing Enron Customers approx The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users The first person logging on will always be the Administrator to set up his users so how can a probable nontrading user accept ETAs for his traders Probably will be a trader change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD MASTER TRADING PASSWORD Unknown Customers currently not trading with Enron willing to get Trading Access Alternative most closely mirrors what were doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control System Admin to run this If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas marketing pack will be signed off by legal business processes already there no extra development effort single point of reference The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form I think we do both alternatives Tims comments The process you have described is as I understood things except that for Guest Users also referred to as Read Only Users Regulators Lawyers Brokers Potential Traders etc As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday I understood the process to be as follows The Guest will phone or sent email possibly fill in a form online that will be automatically emailed to Enron System Administrator Customers will provide info on their name email address mailing address country of incorporation etc If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user the System Administrator will emailfax to the Guest the Read Only ETA The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron by fax or post Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password The Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest This will not be in hard copy it will be online see above we are not going to advertise this read only capability OK Louise The information in this email and in any attachments is confidential

until Monday about the direction they are taking While they are excited about the application and confident that it will work well they have some concerns that there will be issues when they first go live that they would prefer to deal with somewhat quietly Put another way they are leaning towards being lowkeyed until they are confident the system IS working very well ie it has been live for a bit as opposed to BELIEVINGHOPING it will work well and making a big deal BEFORE it goes live I know Im somewhat conservative in these matters but that makes a whole lot of sense to me At this point let

rates In those instances where the rates were higher than the contract we have made adjustments to credit Enron the excess on the final invoice This adjustment took into consideration all incorrect rates from the beginning of the project In those cases where the rates were lower than the contract we have taken no action other than to charge the proper rates for the period from the soft launch invoice to the final invoice For the period prior to the soft launch invoice we have left them at the lower rate This is as we discussed The total credit as a result of this analysis is approximately

Louise,Kitchen,<16079040.1075858590265.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,louise.kitchen@enron.com,2001-06-25 09:58:50,Re Draft Responses to FERC Staff Cc We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty difficult to understand where we are answering each question Is this a s tyle we use with FERC If so fine But if not heres my attempt I have changed quite a few answers too QuestionIn providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessm ent or management would you please provide an explanation to the following We understand that EOL requires that a counter party before accessing E OL to do business with Enron North America must undergo a credit worthines s evaluation When a counter party executes or clicks on a price EOL doe s an instant credit check before confirming the transaction However Enron may not only buy from a counter party it may sell What so rt of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party util izing EOL to purchase from Enron Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter p arty credit risk that Enron uses If yes may we have copies If Enron ut ilizes its own agreements please provide us with a copy All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any trans action being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conduct ed over the phone or through EnronOnline Enron as the principal to all p urchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the t elephone or in writing requires counterparties to be creditworthy In add ition Enrons risk management process is required to be approved by the En ron Board of Directors according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company Enrons risk policies are provided in Enrons pu blicly available Q audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC Enron maintains a separate risk m anagement group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the C hairman of Enron Corp and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded In a ddition every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before the y can transact through EnronOnline The Credit Risk Management group appro ves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are em bedded within the EnronOnline database Every transaction is passed thro ugh an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor l imits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterpartys bid or o ffer via EnronOnline such credit checks are done automatically and there i s no human intervention As with all Enron transactions the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction f low on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually EnronOnl ine does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits No further transactions are executed unles s CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that credit limit is still available EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into whether we are buying or selling The transactions entered into on E nronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Ter ms and Conditions which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity these are all available on the website A Master Agreement i s negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilatera l credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on Enro nOnline The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the count erparty chooses to accept or not online should the counterparty not want t o accept to language in the contract for credit or other reasons the Hel pdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit grou p or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to n egotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them Question I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system However does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled If yes does EOL col lect use or manage data regarding cookies It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customers mouse is moving on the system It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customers mouse is EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled Question Also why doesnt EOL publish a ticker of completed trades showing prices and quantities Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data If yes when There are now several options for viewing historical pricingtransaction da ta from EnronOnline Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnlin e enrononlinequotes which also provides custom ers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they acquire access In addition EnronOnline provides a number of online charts for products which graphically depict historical transaction prices Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and downloa d the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline The system also all ows for administrative users thereby allowing the back offices of counterp arties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in li ne with their own systems Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market ac tivity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices For e xample Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian En erdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place this will commen ce on July At the end of each day EnronOnline makes available t o all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day s transactions The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this fo rmat to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index Question In addition how does the data collection from EOLEnron Net works flow to the risk management groups How is the information used EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depen ding on the type of commodity transacted For example the group that hand les US gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australi an Power The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office utilizing a bridge a process that is capable of communicating transacti on information into the variety of systems that Enron operates The potenti al for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the custom er with more efficient recording of the transaction The back office system s at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions such as invoicing preparation of financial statements risk management and credit These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources including EnronOnline the telephone other trading systems etc Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and re gulatory rules regardless of the source of the transaction The Enron commercial employee who is offering to buy or to sell through En ronOnline does so through a price management software application this no tifies him immediately that a transaction is completed The counterparty the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notifi ed by the system at the same time The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron When a transa ction is completed EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems It does howeve r automate our deal capture system which improves the data feeds to our s ettlement and credit systems Question Also we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL If yes in what form and for how long EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database The tra nsactions are bridged duplicated onto the various systems databases m anaging the underlying commodity the risk system associated with the commo dity We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years pos t a transaction completing for example deliveries finishing and this is policy across all databases In general EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free realtime pricing information for approximately products for comm odities including electricity and natural gas EnronOnline utilizes ecom merce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously t ook place on the telephone and by fax EnronOnline is a proprietary or onetomany trading platform On a onetomany platform one entity suc h as Enron is the principal to every trade unlike a broker type platfor m EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by t he second Buyers or sellers can also see realtime price spreads of both the sell price and the buy price For example on the telephone a buyer p reviously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six month s but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices some prices cou ld have changed EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the bid and off er prices all the time to make more informed decisions The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC has enforc ement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for pot ential manipulation The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulato ry authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale The CFTC has antifraud and antimanipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives swaps and options Moreover pursuant t o the Commodity Exchange Act CEA Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules Suc h transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract Participants ECPsgenerally corporations partnerships and other entit ies that meet net worth or asset tests EnronOnline is a proprietary bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a principal to every trade As such EnronOnline is not a trading facilit y as defined under the CFMA As a proprietary platform EnronOnline uses Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enro n and its customers FromLisa NRON on

first Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic trading exchanges in the energy industry Enron Net Works the division which operates EnronOnline last week signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote LLC And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar deals with several other exchanges including Houstonbased Altra Energy Technologies and RedMeteor as well as eSpeed an exchange backed by Dynegy and Williams HoustonStreet Exchange headquartered in Portsmouth NH was recently ranked among the top dependent energy exchanges by AMR Research a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place True Quote based in Louisville Ky a startup trading platform being developed by APB Energy an overthecounter brokerage firm along with PGE National Energy Group EnForm Technology and Microsoft Corp EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform but users an only trade with Enron Rather than being a true trading exchange industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enrons business But in EnronOnlines first six months of operation after being launched last November the value of transactions conducted on the system surpassed billion at a rate of billion a day The platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities from most forms of energy to bandwidth and paper MORE EYEBALLS The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on HousonStreetcom and TrueQuotecom Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote prices however will appear on EnronOnline Customers on those two sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to EnronOnline where the trades will take place As Louise Kitchen president of EnronOnline said extending their pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron says Paul Bourke president of Altra The question is whether it will build volume for the other exchanges We are talking to Enron Bourke adds We are intrigued and we are attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be He says an EnronAltra deal would be more complicated than those involving other exchanges because of Altras significant liquidity in natural gas Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading While none of the exchanges would reveal what if any financial terms are involved in the agreementsother than to say there is no sharing of commissions Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an agreement Enron would take a small equity position in Altra He speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet Brian Pieri vice president of Red Meteor says the value of EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that they bring tightbid offers which is something the exchanges have to work hard on And more people will make the bid offers even tighter This means buy and sell prices are close together which helps market liquidity Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might bring to the other exchanges wouldnt just further fragment the market Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixthgrade dance The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the other side and nobody is dancing Somebody has to start and then everybody else joins in Enron brings more validity to this very new situation Pied says All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity of which Enron is the king says Bill Swanton an analyst with AMR Research Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the next six to eight months and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not be owned by any single player You need an independent exchange I cant imagine Enron will end up running it The trading community wont be satisfied with that he says Swanton points out however that Enron will attract attention they dont want if they force some of these guys out of business But HoustonStreets CEO Frank Getman takes a different view of what the Enron deals mean Webbased energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity thanks to these EnronOnline

Paul it is very helpful I attach below for completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on EnronOnline There are two remaining issues which require further thought How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline For the short term we can put credit out there but the number of updates will be restricted Using Jays best guess on a slow network connection th e initialization process will take upto minutes and on a normal connection updates every seconds would prevent people from trading So we do have some scaling issues Our model doesnt really function for simultaneou se changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much better specific on how many updates you envisage Do you really envisage that many updates

Justin CT Rod CT Janine CT Mark CT Rick CT Steve W CT Shirl ey A CT David CT David CT Elena CT Subject Credit Trading OnLine Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Me mo NOTE GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit y see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further Best regards Paul,kitchen-l,President

first Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic trading exchanges in the energy industry Enron Net Works the division which operates EnronOnline last week signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote LLC And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar deals with several other exchanges including Houstonbased Altra Energy Technologies and RedMeteor as well as eSpeed an exchange backed by Dynegy and Williams HoustonStreet Exchange headquartered in Portsmouth NH was recently ranked among the top dependent energy exchanges by AMR Research a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place True Quote based in Louisville Ky a startup trading platform being developed by APB Energy an overthecounter brokerage firm along with PGE National Energy Group EnForm Technology and Microsoft Corp EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform but users an only trade with Enron Rather than being a true trading exchange industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enrons business But in EnronOnlines first six months of operation after being launched last November the value of transactions conducted on the system surpassed billion at a rate of billion a day The platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities from most forms of energy to bandwidth and paper MORE EYEBALLS The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on HousonStreetcom and TrueQuotecom Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote prices however will appear on EnronOnline Customers on those two sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to EnronOnline where the trades will take place As Louise Kitchen president of EnronOnline said extending their pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron says Paul Bourke president of Altra The question is whether it will build volume for the other exchanges We are talking to Enron Bourke adds We are intrigued and we are attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be He says an EnronAltra deal would be more complicated than those involving other exchanges because of Altras significant liquidity in natural gas Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading While none of the exchanges would reveal what if any financial terms are involved in the agreementsother than to say there is no sharing of commissions Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an agreement Enron would take a small equity position in Altra He speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet Brian Pieri vice president of Red Meteor says the value of EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that they bring tightbid offers which is something the exchanges have to work hard on And more people will make the bid offers even tighter This means buy and sell prices are close together which helps market liquidity Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might bring to the other exchanges wouldnt just further fragment the market Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixthgrade dance The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the other side and nobody is dancing Somebody has to start and then everybody else joins in Enron brings more validity to this very new situation Pied says All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity of which Enron is the king says Bill Swanton an analyst with AMR Research Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the next six to eight months and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not be owned by any single player You need an independent exchange I cant imagine Enron will end up running it The trading community wont be satisfied with that he says Swanton points out however that Enron will attract attention they dont want if they force some of these guys out of business But HoustonStreets CEO Frank Getman takes a different view of what the Enron deals mean Webbased energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity thanks to these EnronOnline

until Monday about the direction they are taking While they are excited about the application and confident that it will work well they have some concerns that there will be issues when they first go live that they would prefer to deal with somewhat quietly Put another way they are leaning towards being lowkeyed until they are confident the system IS working very well ie it has been live for a bit as opposed to BELIEVINGHOPING it will work well and making a big deal BEFORE it goes live I know Im somewhat conservative in these matters but that makes a whole lot of sense to me At this point let

rates In those instances where the rates were higher than the contract we have made adjustments to credit Enron the excess on the final invoice This adjustment took into consideration all incorrect rates from the beginning of the project In those cases where the rates were lower than the contract we have taken no action other than to charge the proper rates for the period from the soft launch invoice to the final invoice For the period prior to the soft launch invoice we have left them at the lower rate This is as we discussed The total credit as a result of this analysis is approximately

CT David CT Jay CT cc Subject Legal Meeting June Dear all these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention European Jurisdictions Peculiarities Slovenia Cpoatia Romania must be added to Phase reviews Products that considered are gas and power both physical and financial Jurisdictions reviews are already received So far they do not reveal any fundamental problems with the overall structure There are few recommendations on the wording of PAA ETA and GTC to come CC Tim Hueges is summarising all the replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions by Monday th lunch time Possible complications are All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into French and Spanish as part of these jurisdictions requirements Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking validity of signatures it may need to be reflected in the business processes It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well so that potential customers may print them out fill in and mail to Enron YES only in the garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also Read Only Access for some customers instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement therefor it has to be drafted ASAP DRAFTING REQUIRED THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY Product Descriptions A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team Justin Boyd Mark Taylor but not CC or SC OK Timetable GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June First two weeks of July CC will spend validating marketing data Project timetable was promised to CC to be emailed yesterday OK but timings will vary on the basis of what timetable says Translation Translation of GTCs ETA and PPA will be done internally The first priority languages most likely will be French German and Spanish Actions Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP Justin Boyd to coordinate Identify languages to translate into Elena Kapralova to coordinate with Justin and traders Taxes Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions must be sent to Canada Janine Juggins to coordinate Web Page Wording The words I accept and Delete in the box that appears after a customer clicked on price are to be changed into Submit and Clear Lawyers are comfortable with this Different Entities on Counterparty Side If there are a few different entities trading for the same company for ex Morgan Stanley International MSI and Morgan Stanley MS they should be treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate System Administrator passwords This is necessary for tax considerations It is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per System Administrator Authorisation Risk Because Online Trading will be Enrons software all problems arising from authorisation errors for ex when customer that was supposedly authorised to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power will be entirely Enrons liability it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of authorisation functionality of the system in July and AugustNO this would only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view DAVID ISSUE Written and Electronic Confirmations It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating superiority of written vs electronic confirmations According to the UK law an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one generated and mailed by the Back Office similar to the current practice for transactions done over the telephone when phone conversation overwrites all paper conformations In the US the situation is opposite For the deals done over the phone written confirmations still take priority over the phone conversation tape In Texas anything that is not in writing is not enforceable The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be investigated further Mark Taylor to coordinate The result should be reflected in US version of ETA YES This leads to a further question whether sending written confirmations in UK is still necessaryYES UN ECommerce Directive There is a daft of UN Directive on ecommerce which currently has very strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete It requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc Enron might be in position to lobby few items in this Directive Justin and Regulatory Dept What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking two further stages than we have in our system WE need to build a system which can incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now Suspending Trades by Counterparty A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of deals in the same commodity It arises two issues IT the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the transaction summary page bottom of the price page YES Legal CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law NO PROBLEM BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS Price Check Idea Just a thought whether it is technically possible to amend a price check the one done when the customer submitted a price and database does credit GTC and price check in a way that customer is notified about the price change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron ie if price moved in Enrons favour transaction should go forward at the price customer had agreed to earlier Legally it is OK Jay can the system do it YES Internal Issues still to be addressed Global Liquids Books management ie how responsibilities for price update will be managed between London and Houston desksDAVID FX conversion including IT business processes tax risk managment issues

on how to register this is what we are doing Any comments or problems please reply I have tried to address everyones points see end of email Current Customers We are going to preregister a large number of customers prior to the launch These customers will not receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form Password Application and a nice glossy marketing brochure They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people Procedure A list of customers to be preregistered is compiled Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax Credit Legal etc The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form postal and a marketing brochure this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process to include whether to send to UK os US office The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty The customer signs the document Password Application and returns to Enron Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transacts If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodityproduct type Elenas questions Q Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the House No only in the garden PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden drop down box would be my suggestion New Customers There are two alternative routes possible Procedure Off Line Registration Potential Customer will email phone to express their willingness to trade online ie get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password Procedure Two Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose drop down box which jurisdiction he is in print out appropriate Registration Form and PA fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side Elenas questions Q Alternative or Both In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted YES In the garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion this is not just for Read Only its for all applications Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be availableYES Read Only Customers If a customer counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access We will no be advertising read only access as available They will be able to enter the site for a period for time Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customercounterparty is given readonly access for unable to transact but view only Procedure Either Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time or a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers The Product Control Group will issue a passwordlogin which will be time dated only valid for a certain period The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA these are to be country specific The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords not like a system administrator password When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices Elenas issues Should Read Only ETA be printable and where YES should be printable when it appears on screen at login no need for it to be in the garden What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User ie one log in session limited time etc This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July th Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access see above Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line but accepting it online should work as well and seems to be a cleaner wayNo this will be signedclicked online just like the ETAs Marks comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned If they are in reality that is none of our concern Agreed we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process we have legal confirmation of your comment I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it which I think is where Bob is coming from Only one person per System Administration Password Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA Guest only users This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday and I have some process queries on it See above How do we separate identify the applications See above What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process other queries Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically Need a Read Only ETA see document for further understanding Limitations to be imposed where is this being coded and who by There will be a timetable impact This is not new and therefore isnt Bobs comments Existing Enron Customers approx The first person from the customers company logging Online has to accept ETA After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users The first person logging on will always be the Administrator to set up his users so how can a probable nontrading user accept ETAs for his traders Probably will be a trader change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD MASTER TRADING PASSWORD Unknown Customers currently not trading with Enron willing to get Trading Access Alternative most closely mirrors what were doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control System Admin to run this If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas marketing pack will be signed off by legal business processes already there no extra development effort single point of reference The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form I think we do both alternatives Tims comments The process you have described is as I understood things except that for Guest Users also referred to as Read Only Users Regulators Lawyers Brokers Potential Traders etc As we discussed on Wednesday and as Andrew mentioned yesterday I understood the process to be as follows The Guest will phone or sent email possibly fill in a form online that will be automatically emailed to Enron System Administrator Customers will provide info on their name email address mailing address country of incorporation etc If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user the System Administrator will emailfax to the Guest the Read Only ETA The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to Enron by fax or post Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password The Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest This will not be in hard copy it will be online see above we are not going to advertise this read only capability

the below email It is good to clear up the confusion regarding this process At the end of the email you ask for our comments on the ROETA execution process We would prefer that the ROETA be executed offline It is on that basis that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel That said you may form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer On that basis you may decide to execute the ROETA online We have some concerns regarding security issues because of the distribution of a password without a supporting agreement however you may form the view that this is a minor risk If you have any other questions please do not hesitate contact me Regards Timothy Hughes Clifford Chance Aldersgate St ECA JJ London UK direct switch fax Original Message From SMTP Sent Monday July PM To Elena Kapralova Rahil Jafry Mark Dilworth Mark ECT Legal Taylor Jay Webb Robert Campbell Edmund Cooper David G Mally Subject Registration Process Questions Lets be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how to register this is what we are doing Any comments or problems please reply I have tried to address everyones points see end of email Current Customers We are going to preregister a large number of customers prior to the launch These customers will not receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form Password Application and a nice glossy marketing brochure They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people Procedure A list of customers to be preregistered is compiled Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax Credit Legal etc The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form postal and a marketing brochure this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process to include whether to send to UK os US office The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty The customer signs the document Password Application and returns to Enron Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transacts If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodityproduct type Elenas questions Q Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the House No only in the garden PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden drop down box would be my suggestion New Customers There are two alternative routes possible Procedure Off Line Registration Potential Customer will email phone to express their willingness to trade online ie get the ID and Password Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password Procedure Two Partial OnLine Registration Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the Garden Customer has to chose drop down box which jurisdiction he is in print out appropriate Registration Form and PA fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it to Enron Customer will fill in Registration Form sign PA and mail it back to Enron If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron it will receive the system administrator login and password The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either I accept or I do not accept with no default on enter This ETA must be printable The customer then enters the site and transactsThe customer is transacting GTCs for all products and any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side Elenas questions Q Alternative or Both In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted YES In the garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion this is not just for Read Only its for all applications Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden CC prefers them to be availableYES Read Only Customers If a customer counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access We will no be advertising read only access as available They will be able to enter the site for a period for time Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customercounterparty is given readonly access for unable to transact but view only Procedure Either Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time or a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers The Product Control Group will issue a passwordlogin which will be time dated only valid for a certain period The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA these are to be country specific The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords not like a system administrator password When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices Elenas issues Should Read Only ETA be printable and where YES should be printable when it appears on screen at login no need for it to be in the garden What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User ie one log in session limited time etc This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July th Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month In the Garden there must be a sentence to be drafted by CC to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access see above Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line but accepting it online should work as well and seems to be a cleaner wayNo this will be signedclicked online just like the ETAs Marks comments System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned If they are in reality that is none of our concern Agreed we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator ETA acceptance process we have legal confirmation of your comment I would expect that all users

it is very helpful I attach below for completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on EnronOnline There are two remaining issues which require further thought How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline For the short term we can put credit out there but the number of updates will be restricted Using Jays best guess on a slow network connection th e initialization process will take upto minutes and on a normal connection updates every seconds would prevent people from trading So we do have some scaling issues Our model doesnt really function for simultaneou se changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much better specific on how many updates you envisage Do you really envisage that many updates

LAUNCH DATE OF JANUARY FOR THIS PRODUCT THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGA L DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO As you know we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries where it was intended the credit product would initially be traded via EnronOnLine namely the UK the US Canada Finland Germany Norway Sweden and Switzerland Under the terms of the credit product on the occurrence of a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party the Reference Entity the Seller of the product which could be either Enron or its online counterparty will pay a fixed preagreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer It should be borne in mind that this product differ s in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues I am also attaching a two page Executive Summar y of Legal Advice prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significa nt legal issuesrisks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail As you will see the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are all clear from a legal perspective so as to keep the summary to a sensible length but there was plenty of good news too Where a legal issue has been identified I have either set out belo w what action is to be taken or not addressed it further on the basis that on the advice of foreign counsel the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise Therefore where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary please assume that the legal risk is one which in our view it is reasonable to take A Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January Finland Norway Sweden Switzerland UK US B Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to b e delayed Canada Germany reasons set out below C General Issues applicable in all countries The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature i Capacity We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade t he product and so will need to check each counterpartys constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online This applies t o almost all entities eg corporates municipalities insurance companies in all countries Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all or under their constitutional documents in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures It is not a particular ly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally ii Confidentiality We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it The procedures will not includ e formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders o r the credit department a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions The procedures will include a the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe similar to the procedure currently used in Houston and b practical steps to ensure tha t confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use eg because it is the subject of a confidentiali ty agreement is not imparted to the credit traders In addition where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity o r otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity Withou t such consent there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by tha t entity for breach of confidence D Country Specific Issues i Canada There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter ii Germany Again the issue is insurance The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially iii Norway There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway in which case trades would be void and unenforceable The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a substantial professional effort to satisfy ourselves that a trade is bein g entered into for valid commercial purposes normally hedging by our counterparty Clearly it will not be possible to take such steps on a trad e by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline At a minimum we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type iv Switzerland If the credit product is the main purpose of our tradi ng relationship with a counterparty we should check with the Swiss supervisor y authority whether the product constitutes insurance the position being unclear If a trade is insurance it can be terminated by the counterpart y which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer and an offenc e will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer Howeve r I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships in which case we can parallel path this issue v US New York Law a CFTC regulation by structuring the product either as a swap or an option and meeting certain other conditions we can rely on exemptions und er the US Commodities Exchange Act b US securities laws there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a security under US securities laws please see attached Executive Summary However SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to accredited investors which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US million in assets Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large sophisticated players this test shoul d not impede the business c Insider trading US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as securit y see b above is relatively remote Please feel free to call me on x if you would like to discuss this project further Best regards Paul,kitchen-l,President

attach below for completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on EnronOnline There are two remaining issues which require further thought How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline For the short term we can put credit out there but the number of updates will be restricted Using Jays best guess on a slow network connection th e initialization process will take upto minutes and on a normal connection updates every seconds would prevent people from trading So we do have some scaling issues Our model doesnt really function for simultaneou se changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much better specific on how many updates you envisage Do you really envisage that many updates Also we havent yet experienced fast updates which we will do when FX joins the system We have approximately guest id and passwords Can these see credi t pricing from a due diligence perspective Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline

of next week to sign the full contract The delivery of the project will be th September although the contract heavily incentivizes the company to complete within weeks of now Agencycom The discovery process has commenced During this period we are bringing together a large number of the team to ensure that the work to be carried out is in line with our requirements Members of the team will be commuting to the Agencycom office in Dallas over the next week these include Jay Webb Marcello Romano Pat Gogerty Chris Dodds and Tilak for two days Going forward Paul Goddard will be the main commercial contact with Agencycom and he will be responsible for accessing the correct information individuals within Enron as and when required for the Agencycom work For the next week Paul will be replaced by Marcello as the interface during discovery whilst Paul ensures that the contract is completed between ourselves and Agencycom We are pushing very hard for contract completion earlymid next week The main commercial terms of the contract include incentives and penalties which hopefully will increase their potential to deliver early Delivery of application th September Estimate of costs million for JE Incentives week earlier than week Penalties of costsweek Exclusivity months on energy commodities Documents attached for information Back up up service provider Anthony has told ICube that at the current time they are our number two choice and should we fail to reach agreement on the actual term of the agreement with Agencycom next week then we will be contacting them to continue negotiations Trading Team Coordination Europe Elena Kapralova Elena has produced initial product descriptions working with the individual trading groups US Paul Racicot Paul is working with the North American trader representatives on raising the awareness of the project he aims to have details on the products by the end of this week He has also worked on highlighting the requirements such as staffing and space which need to be pushed in peoples minds early in this project to prepare for launch Both of the above will be coordinating feeback sessions with the trader groups on the prototype in approximately weeks Business Process We now have a fairly substantial team in place for the Business Process side of the project Europe David Port Process Leader Bryan SeyfriedDavid Weekes Control Credit Janine Juggins Tax US David Mally Process Leader Bill Bradford Control Credit Tax TBA David Port is leading the way with scoping out the Business Process side of the project and plans to have completed substantial documentation by the end of this week He will be coordinating with Dave Mally and a roundtable meeting on the Business Process implementation will be held in the next two weeks in the Houston office From the OnLine team itself the Business Process is being helped by Arfan Aziz who is currently tasked with creating a counterparty database to facilitate the process of enabling counterparties to trade on the system PR The approach to developing the site has been agreed with Mark Palmer We have instructed the agency that they are to abide by the guidelines for the Enron Logo and get a feel for the Enron style through the intranet pages although allowing them fairly free rein with the site initially up to prototype and under Pauls watch to use their creative approach to creating the site Out of interest I spent time with the Design Director this afternoon and the actual sites they have produced are pretty impressive here are some examples if you are interested wwwbritishairwayscom wwwsprintcom wwwbenettoncom Another site which I think offers some of the appeal we would need is wwwvwcom Apart from Marks involvement in the project he has also asked George Tzinas and Marge Nadasky from his team to assist in this project Legal and Regulatory US Legal Meeting held with Sullivan Cromwell They are happy with the overall structure of the site conceptually and offered several methods of tightening the process of binding a customer to the transaction on the Click and minimising the risks to Enron These are captured within their first draft of the agreements These are in first draft format only and have yet to be reviewed by Enron The concept we are working with currently for the US market are generic language formats to override current Masters The current format which is under review is the idea of an enabling agreement ie the piece of paper they sign to register and then a text book on screen to clock on when they enter the site I am thinking that we should work towards one document which is much simpler althoughslightly longer US Regulatory We will be involving Steve Kean and Cynthia Santer from his group in order to ensure that they remain up to speed with the project European Regulatory Work has kicked off on compiling the jurisdictional issues with regard to Europe We are facing an issue in that each commodity has one GTC and this is difficult for example German Power would be under German Law for German counterparties and English Law for English counterparties and we really need to have a default approximately

Christie Patrick PM To Louise CT Greg CT Andy nronXGate cc Jeffrey A nronXGate Vince J nronXGate Mark NRON Subject Wharton Guys First of all Louise I understand we have a baby CONGRATULATIONS details please at your earliest chance Regarding the Wharton eBusiness Initiative see below for one of the many eMails Ive received concerning Enrons participationlink to the referenced web site for specific agenda also Ive received several voice messages from leaders of the effort The information below discusses one of the forums coming up that comprise an ongoing ebusiness initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton The participants from Wharton include senior level professors while there may be some student involvement the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research Again this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side and high level eBusiness Corporate executives on the other side This is intentionally designed to create a highlevel ethinktank environment for senior level professors and corporate executives OKhave I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enrons favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting this is intentionally a researchdiscussion effort Clearly the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings references course work etc A few weeks ago Louise and I breifly chatted about Enrons involvement in this effort Clearly there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participatethey quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequentlyAll of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvementinfact yet the question remains is there someone at Enron directly involved in Enrons eBusiness initiatives interested in jumping into this effort and participating Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense or the time and expense of one of your senior at least Director level people to participate Would it be viewed at least at this time simply as an Enron brain drain Ive received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron The bottom line is Id like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that at this time Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the financial level it has already investedwith the option to participate at other levels in the future at Enrons discretion ALL comments solicited Many thanks Christie Forwarded by Christie PatrickHOUECT on PM HartleyR

please at your earliest chance Regarding the Wharton eBusiness Initiative see below for one of the many eMails Ive received concerning Enrons participationlink to the referenced web site for specific agenda also Ive received several voice messages from leaders of the effort The information below discusses one of the forums coming up that comprise an ongoing ebusiness initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton The participants from Wharton include senior level professors while there may be some student involvement the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research Again this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side and high level eBusiness Corporate executives on the other side This is intentionally designed to create a highlevel ethinktank environment for senior level professors and corporate executives OKhave I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enrons favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting this is intentionally a researchdiscussion effort Clearly the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings references course work etc A few weeks ago Louise and I breifly chatted about Enrons involvement in this effort Clearly there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participatethey quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequentlyAll of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvementinfact yet the question remains is there someone at Enron directly involved in Enrons eBusiness initiatives interested in jumping into this effort and participating Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense or the time and expense of one of your senior at least Director level people to participate Would it be viewed at least at this time simply as an Enron brain drain Ive received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron The bottom line is Id like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that at this time Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the financial level it has already investedwith the option to participate at other levels in the future at Enrons discretion ALL comments solicited Many thanks Christie Forwarded by Christie PatrickHOUECT on PM HartleyR
