RE Leon Kent and Lloyds Mary Im not sure what me fee would be but once I get a better idea of what is required I can provide it I cannot imagine that it would be too muchyou know that we try to bill according to the value provided to the client Unfortunately I will be out of town visiting my new grandson Luca Pelizzoli Bishop in Tanzania from June to July I would like to meet with all of the beneficiaries as soon as possible however When will John be in town again At the very least lets meet with you and Bill LloydsJeanne Long follows the ALMANA information fairly closely Evidently there was a fairly significant court case which a Texas Name lost last week I do not know the details but she is somewhat concerned I still cannot imagine that the courts in Texas will allow some foreigner to come here and take assets from honest Texans Jeanne tells me that there is a lot of politics involved that the FBI is interested in pursuing Lloyds on some securities fraud or investment scam charges but that the British government is trying to intervene Ive got no idea what it means but if I were you I would consider all my decisions with the thought of protection against a bad court outcome as a possibility As a practical matter this means Keep all trust or estate assets in the trust or estate minimize your nonexempt assets and maximize your exempt assets such as taking any exposed funds and putting them into pension funds or paying off a mortgage on a homestead If you would like to come in to discuss asset protection I would be glad to talk to you on a friend basis rather than a charge basis let me know when you find the trust agreement David Original Message From To Sent PM Subject RE Leon Kent and Lloyds David I would like to go forward with using you as a trustee I dont think that you will be exposing yourself to any liability The next question is what will your monthly fee be Would you be available to meet with John and hopefully Bill and myself John

about to call him and tell him not to worry about Lloyds but another client just called and said Lloyds is breathing down my neck The possible Lloyds exposure is one more reason to keep the assets in

email you back for the last week It has been on my list of things to do and of course Im procrastinating I even promised my brother John I would get back with you on Monday Well I didnt fulfill that promise but Im just one day late Leon Kent is still alive Tell Leon that I get monthly correspondance from Equitas and that I trash it They are still trying to get names to rejoin There is nothing knew that is happening at Lloyds except the usual propaganda that is put out by the groups that were formed in hopes of suing Lloyds They tend to send out material saying that Lloyds can still come after names after they have settled with Equitas Back to the trusts I really was hoping that youthe firm would take over When I said that I wouldnt handle the accounting of the trusts because of family difficulties I was refering to my oldest brother John who has a law degree and knows enough to ask questions and he keeps asking questions that I get stressed trying to answer and then we get into an arguement I wanted someone who knows what their doing to handle the trusts because he wont ask them any questions and it is worth it to me so I can have peace and quiet George knows John John had heard good press about you and was very comfortable if you were interested in handling the trusts once Chase Bank is removed as trustee Bill who is extremely easy going will go with anything I

called me about Lloyds In my clients Ive got four or five Lloyds members some took the Equitas settlement some remain Lloyds names and some just quit answering the mail My basic advice to Leon is
