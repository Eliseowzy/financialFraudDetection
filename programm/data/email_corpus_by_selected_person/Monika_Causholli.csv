Message From Timo Ters mailto Sent Tuesday July AM To Causholli Monika Cc Subject Re Foex Index yr two emails Hi Monika Welcome to the pulp and paper world In order to understand the index system the first thing is to look at our website wwwfoexfi which includes a lot of information particularly in this case the FAQ section You probably have taken a look at that already though Our two pulp indexes NBSKP Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft and BHKP bircheucalyptus cover the European market As abt of the world pulp trade is for the European market these are in a way considered to be the world market prices particularly as the third biggest market North America Asia is the second biggest has virtually the same prices as Europe correlation between the two is well over The sellers reporting to us are by definition in NBSKP from Canada US West Coast and the Nordic countries BHKP birch euca sellers are from the Nordic region Latin America Spain and Portugal and a number of AsianAfrican companies selling Eucalyptus pulp to the European market Buyers are European producers of paper and paperboard buying at least some of their pulp from the open market representing virtually all countires in Western Europe The split between birch and euca is approximately again reflecting the actual situation in the European market The exact coverage is difficult to calculate as some of the data received from buyers are from same deals which are reported by the sellers and some are not The producers reporting to us represent roughly of the supply to Europe in the two benchmark grades Most of the pulp sold in Europe is socalled contract business This means that a buyer and a seller have an annual or multiannual contract covering the grades and volumes quantity rebates etc However prices are fixed also for contract business on a monthlyquarterly basis Most of the pulp arriving Continental Europe or UK from abroad goes through consignment warehouses in places like Antwerp Rotterdam La Pallice Tilbury SavonoLivorno range etc As forwarding companies allow days of free storage buyers do not hold much inventory at their mills but take the pulp delivered by sellers in large shipments little be little by lorry rail or barge Each delivery is invoiced separately and those invoice prices are the price reported to us before customer specific rebates Prices are for prime grade pulp and for delivery during the current or latest for the following month The following comments are worth making Our system is based on first taking off top and bottom of the prices received and only then calculating the index or rather benchmark values This way we avoid any clerical errors in the data received as well as any theoretical attempts of manipulation we have never detected any attempts We have a more or less equal number of prices received from buyers and sellers Some we receive through agentsmerchantstrading houses usually mandated by a supplier to give us the price data If someone does not report their prices on a given week we can use the previous weeks data but only once Prices are not volumeweighted in order to avoid the manipulation possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones Prices are CIF European port before customerspecific rebates again to avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain unchanged also rebates are often given only afterwards eg when exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold and we cannot alter our indexes retroactively Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European Community antitrust regulators DG IV and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers There is a group of independent experts case need as trouble shooters Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the index values Participation is totally voluntary The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes and Pulpex quotations include a our prices are before customerspecific rebates averaging Pulpex prices are net b our prices are for contract business Pulpex prices represent the lowest spotlevels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market c our price info is based on actual sales Pulpex prices are expectations what the spot price might be in eg months time d our price is for a prime quality within each benchmark grade there are surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold approved by a seller from a particular suppliermill whilst Pulpex prices based on a delivery concept ie you do not accept the price offered to close a contract you can maketake delivery are prices in a particular inventory location alternative ones sometimes far away from

received from buyers and sellers Some we receive through agentsmerchantstrading houses usually mandated by a supplier to give us the price data If someone does not report their prices on a given week we can use the previous weeks data but only once Prices are not volumeweighted in order to avoid the manipulation possibility and unnecessary weekly changes up and down because a supplier sold one week to large customers and next week to small ones Prices are CIF European port before customerspecific rebates again to avoid unnecessary volatility of the index at a time when prices remain unchanged also rebates are often given only afterwards eg when exceeding a certain tonnage threshhold and we cannot alter our indexes retroactively Our index system is approved by financial regulators and by European Community antitrust regulators DG IV and audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers There is a group of independent experts case need as trouble shooters Never have had any and never have received any official complaints about the index values Participation is totally voluntary The main reasons for differences between the often compared FOEX indexes and Pulpex quotations include a our prices are before customerspecific rebates averaging Pulpex prices are net b our prices are for contract business Pulpex prices represent the lowest spotlevels in a weak market and highest spots in a strong market c our price info is based on actual sales Pulpex prices are expectations what the spot price might be in eg months time d our price is for a prime quality within each benchmark grade there are surprisingly large differences between individual mill grades sold approved by a seller from a particular suppliermill whilst Pulpex prices based on a delivery concept ie you do not accept the price offered to close a contract you can maketake delivery are prices in a particular inventory location alternative ones sometimes far away from buyers or sellers normal ports for any lot often unknownunwanted grade up to months and days old goods This system tends to emphasize in the Pulpex system the extreme prices up or down particularly in these early stages with low liquidity Our indexes are trademarked products Therefore their use for any commercial purposes is possible only with our permission To get that permission users pay us a small premium the main source of our income

press release SchweitzerMauduit Intern ational Inc NYSE SWM news today announced a plan to restructure its Brazilian operations and exit the printing and writing uncoated papers busi ness in Brazil in response to current business conditions A pretax charge of approximately to million will be taken in the second quarter of to implement this restructuring Excluding this unusual item the C ompany anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of to be in the range of to per share Second quarter diluted earn ings per share in were Brazilian Restructuring Wayne H Deitrich Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer comme nted that Recent changes in Brazilian business conditions made it necess ary for SchweitzerMauduit to reassess its ability to continue to compete e ffectively in the printing and writing uncoated papers market Sales volume s during the past six months have been unfavorably impacted by a slowdown i n the Brazilian printing and writing papers market as well as by a decision by the Company to reduce its sales of certain grades of these papers that have been negatively impacted by ICMS a form of valueadded business tax In addition the recently enacted electricity rationing program in Brazil h as necessitated production curtailments in our Brazilian operations The pr inting and writing uncoated papers business is our least profitable product line in Brazil while being our largest electricity user The decision to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in B razil will result in a pretax charge in the second quarter of of appr oximately to million or to per share for a noncash w riteoff of assets In addition a further pretax charge of approximately to million or to per share will be taken in the third quarter primarily related to employee termination and severance costs Sc hweitzerMauduit do Brasils net sales of printing and writing uncoated pap ers totaled approximately million in Because of cost reduction st eps to be implemented as part of the restructuring exiting the printing an d writing uncoated papers business is not expected to have a material impac t on ongoing operating results after the restructuring is fully implemented which should occur by yearend Brazilian Energy Situation In late May the Brazilian government announced the details of its electric ity rationing program which has an overall objective of a percent reduct ion in electricity consumption and mandates a percent reduction in elect ricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industri alized regions of Brazil The reduction is calculated from prioryear avera ge electricity consumption The reduction must be measured and achieved for consecutive thirtyday periods commencing May Failure to achieve the mandated reductions would result in higher electricity rates and cuts in electrical power service The duration of the governments energy reduct ion directive is uncertain although it is expected to last at least six mon ths through the traditional dry period in Brazil The governments for ced consumption reduction program is in response to unusually low water lev els in the lakes and reservoirs supplying Brazils hydroelectric facilities that provide percent of that countrys electricity In response to the Brazilian governments energy reduction directive Schwe itzerMauduit do Brasil implemented a fourpart electricity reduction progr am All nonessential nonmanufacturing uses of electricity are being elimina ted including cuts in air conditioning reduced lighting and changes in the operation of the water and effluent treatment plants Manufacturing proces s modifications are being implemented to achieve more energyefficient usag e of equipment where product quality will not be compromised A comprehensi ve energy conservation training program is being conducted for Brazilian em ployees and contracted service providers of the Company to increase awarene ss and solicit ideas for additional electricity reduction To achieve the percent electrical consumption reduction target it has also been necessa ry to implement production curtailments Machine downtime has been taken to reduce the production of the Companys least profitable products Mr Deitrich added that SchweitzerMauduit does not expect the governmen ts electricity reduction program to significantly affect the demand for or its ability to produce tobaccorelated papers Likewise the availability of the Companys major raw materials such as wood pulp chemicals and chalk and the ability to receive raw materials and ship finished product are not expected to be materially impacted Exiting the printing and writing uncoa ted papers business will permit SchweitzerMauduit do Brasil to better focu s on and service its other product lines Anticipated Second Quarter Results Excluding the unusual charge associated with restructuring the Brazilian op erations the Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of to be in the range of to per share Operating pr ofit improvement is anticipated in both the French and US business units compared with the prioryear quarter Results for the quarter are expected to benefit from increased tobaccorelated papers sales volumes lower wood pulp costs and improvement in average selling prices The average per ton l ist price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp in the United States was per metric ton in the second quarter of compared with per m etric ton in the second quarter of These positive factors will be par tially offset by higher purchased energy costs and expenses related to the banded cigarette paper project and resultant higher cost of operations at t he Spotswood New Jersey mill

oloradoedu Sent Friday November AM To Nielsen James COB Subject RE Hello Old Friend Hi Jim It has been a long time between communications We no longer offer an MS in Finance however I believe the Denver Campus does We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each yearthus it is very competitive Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and he could be contacted at Eric oloradoEDU mailtoEric oloradoEDU Unfortunately I dont have any specific recommendations Ron PSI also still like the teaching part of the academic life and probably wont be retiring for another few years Original Message From Nielsen James COB mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Ronald oloradoEDU Subject Hello Old Friend Hi Ron It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I Moreover I dont have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Masters Degree in Finance or PhD Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time Given what is happening at Enron I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also dont offer a master degree in finance or PhD Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years She is incredibly bright and works very hard Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships If I recall George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU If so can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her

however I believe the Denver Campus does We admit only one or two new students in the Finance PhD Program each yearthus it is very competitive Our Finance PhD Program coordinator is Eric Hughson and

be retiring for another few years Original Message From Nielsen James COB mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Ronald oloradoEDU Subject Hello Old Friend Hi Ron It certainly has been a long time since we have communicated I am glad to see that you have not yet retired and either have I Moreover I dont have any plans to do so in the immediate future as this job is so much fun The reason I am writing is that a former student of mine from Albania who works for Enron has been thinking for some time that she would like to go back to school and get a Masters Degree in Finance or PhD Being a foreign student she needs to get some sort of scholarship or assistantship She graduated from OSU a year or so ago and has been working at Enron since that time Given what is happening at Enron I am not surprised that she has decided to go back for a graduate degree Our College of Business does not have any graduate student assistantships and we also dont offer a master degree in finance or PhD Monika is without a doubt one of the sharpest students I have had in recent years She is incredibly bright and works very hard Does CU still offer the masters degree in finance and still offer student assistantships If I recall George Carvel was working on a MS in Finance and had an assistantship under Maurice Unger when I was going to CU If so can I give Monika your name and have her contact and perhaps forward her resume to you Or can you put her in touch with the right person at CU If CU does not have anything available do you know of a few schools who might so that I can pass the
