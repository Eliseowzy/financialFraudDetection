TRANSMISSION FILES APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE TO BUILD NEW PIPELINE AND COMPRESSION FACILITIES AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TENNESSEES LOOP SERVICE Foster Natural Gas Report c Copyright Foster Associates Inc On December CNG Transmission Corp CP submitted a certificate application to FERC requesting authorization to construct facilities in Pennsylvania and New York in order to substitute its own transportation capacity for market area service entitlements that CNG currently holds on Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co pursuant to terms of an expiring contract CNGs contract with Tennessee has a primary term until with a oneyear notification requirement to terminate Acting quickly on terms of a settlement RP approved by the Commission on which capped CNGs upstream costs and freed CNG to build its own facilities to replace capacity currently purchased from Tennessee CNG proposes to construct approximately miles of inch pipeline TLx a loop of its existing pipeline in Armstrong County Pennsylvania to install approximately horsepower of additional compression in three Pennsylvania counties and approximately hp of compression at Brookman Corners Station in Montgomery County New York to construct and operate approximately feet of inch pipeline known as the Connector Line TL between TLx and lines LN and LN in Armstrong County and to abandon approximately miles of a inch diameter pipeline in Armstrong County known as LN CNGs existing parallel pipeline LN purportedly is sufficient to maintain existing services to the markets served by this part of CNGs system These facilities are designed to recreate southtonorth delivery capacity on the CNG system to substitute for looping service that has been purchased from Tennessee In support CNG claims first its proposal results in nearterm and longterm savings to its existing firm service customers without degrading service Second by not requiring assignees to maintain firm upstream entitlements to service on the Tennessee system the project will reduce the fixed cost burden for consumers downstream of CNGs LDC customers Third CNGs proposal eases the constraint for deliveries on CNGs system from southern receipt points to northern delivery points across the Valley Gate Junction located in central Pennsylvania CNG thus will be able to eliminate its standing mustflow operational flow order After placing the proposed facilities in service CNG will modify its tariff to eliminate the requirement that customers with North of Valley receipt points primarily CNGs interconnection with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp at Leidy Pennsylvania can be directed to use their capacity to tender quantities of gas to CNG throughout the Winter Period Fourth the proposed construction will enable CNG to meet its existing market commitments During the first three years after the projected inservice date of this project less than of CNGs firm transportation capacity will be eligible to expire Fifth to the extent that markets can be served in the future either by CNGs own facilities or by the turnedback capacity that Tennessee accrues in its Zones through the CNG construction presents a competitive alternative Background CNGs longhaul contract with Tennessee provides for delivery of natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico plus reliance on an operational loop of CNGs system operated by Tennessee that allows CNG to offer more storage and transportation capacity than CNG could provide on its own In the aftermath of Order No however CNG unbundled its storage and transportation services and exited the merchant function CNG which no longer required a significant portion of the Tennessee capacity from the Gulf to Tennessees interconnections with CNG in Tennessee Zone agreed to assign its upstream capacity on Tennessee from the production area to a Zone transfer point South Webster while retaining the capacity from South Webster to delivery points interconnecting with CNG in Tennessee Zones and to facilitate dispatching and nonotice service to CNGs customers In conjunction with CNGs restructuring settlement one transaction on the Tennessee system thus was separated into two parts with CNG and its assignees paying Tennessee reservation and usage charges for the capacity as if Tennessee had a single customer from the Gulf to the market area Tennessee charged CNGs converting customers the applicable Zone delivery rate for transporting gas from Zones and to West Virginia and the South Webster transfer point CNG in turn is charged an incremental rate for transporting gas from South Webster to CNGs delivery points in Zone and determined by subtracting the maximum reservation and usage rates applicable to Tennessees Zone including applicable surcharges from the maximum reservation and usage rates including surcharges for the haul rate from the Gulf to either Zone or The incremental rate is approximately onethird of Tennessees maximum tariff rates for Rate Schedule FTA service from Zones to or Zones to respectively In negotiations to examine the fate of the expiring contract Tennessee conveyed to CNG that in order to preserve revenue neutrality the assigned upstream contract that feeds the CNGTennessee market contract No must match exactly the maximum daily quantity MDQ of the downstream contract Any mismatched quantities will be priced to CNG at Tennessees maximum tariff rates for FTA service Unless CNG were to require all assignees to continue to hold upstream capacity on the Tennessee system therefore CNG would no longer qualify for the incremental rate on Tennessee on the mismatched capacity retained by CNG Meanwhile as CNGs assignees have elected to turn back upstream Tennessee capacity CNGs costs would go up unless CNG chooses to turn back an equal quantity of service downstream of South Webster The cost increase on CNG to its customers if all assignees turned back would be approximately million per year CNG notified Tennessee on November that it will extend only a portion of its current contract for a oneyear period in order to accommodate a new CNG construction schedule The initial termination dates for CNGs customers upstream contracts all assigned from CNGs original contract with Tennessee were the same Absent the termination notice the contract provides for an automatic extension for a primary term of five years Proposal to Build Facilities Given the circumstances CNG proposes to build the facilities needed to serve its existing market without having to rely on Tennessee for the traditional looping service provided under this contract Thus CNGs customers would avoid the anticipated Tennessee cost increase that would result if CNG renewed the contract at Tennessees maximum rates Instead CNGs customers will experience an annual cost decrease as a result when compared to the transportation costs approved by the Commission in CNGs Docket TMOO CNG proposes to roll the costs of this project into CNGs general system transportation rates Such treatment the applicant argued is supported by the projected cost decrease to existing customers as well as by the systemwide benefits that will result The benefits outweigh any adverse impacts on the affected interests as examined pursuant to FERCs policy PL No subsidies exist under the circumstances as the facilities actually will prevent a cost increase to existing customers The proposed construction also makes certain cost reductions possible for all of the CNG customers that took assignment of upstream firm services on Tennessee during CNGs restructuring proceeding Accordingly CNG has met the Commissions policy threshold requirement to establish that its project satisfies the public convenience and necessity standard Pursuant to the Transportation Cost Recovery Adjustment TCRA terms in the settlement approved by the Commission on December CNG will continue to collect its TCRA at agreed levels a specified portion of which will be attributed to the costs of the project The annual cost of this project to CNGs firm transportation customers will be million which corresponds to the incremental payment that CNG had been making to Tennessee for Zones and firm transportation services through the TCRA CNG related that turnbacks are due to state retail unbundling initiatives that reduce the LDCs need to maintain pipeline capacity in support of a merchant role In addition increased liquidity in the commodity market largely because of Commission policies supporting market centers has increased opportunities to purchase gas in the market area These developments coupled with the potential for significant fixedcost savings motivated CNGs assignees to want to terminate upstream capacity contracts Therefore while CNG could have required its assignees to maintain upstream Tennessee capacity the proposed construction offers a more effective longterm mechanism to enable CNG to manage the risk of future cost increases for its customers The applicant said a recognized potential adverse impact on the captive customers of Tennessee who might face cost shifting is outweighed by the public benefits of CNGs proposal Moreover Tennessee need remarket only a portion of the former CNG marketarea capacity in order to recoup CNGs contribution to Tennessees revenue requirement Tennessee also has expressed confidence in its ability to secure markets for this newly available capacity In order to avoid unnecessary construction CNG indicated it conducted a reverse open season for two weeks during October in which CNG solicited customer interest in turning back firm service entitlements through an announcement on its electronic bulletin board No customer sought to turn back service entitlements in support of the proposed project To address potential landowner concerns CNG plans to construct this pipeline adjacent to an existing natural gas pipeline rightofway for which CNG already holds easement agreements CNG has also directly contacted each affected landowner and secured landowner authorization to conduct both engineering and environmental studies on of the proposed rightofway Copyright c Dow Jones

facilities to replace capacity currently purchased from Tennessee CNG proposes to construct approximately miles of inch pipeline TLx a loop of its existing pipeline in Armstrong County Pennsylvania to install approximately horsepower of additional compression in three Pennsylvania counties and approximately hp of compression at Brookman Corners Station in Montgomery County New York to construct and operate approximately feet of inch pipeline known as the Connector Line TL between TLx and lines LN and LN in Armstrong County and to abandon approximately miles of a inch diameter pipeline in Armstrong County known as LN CNGs existing parallel pipeline LN purportedly is sufficient to maintain existing services to the markets served by this part of CNGs system These facilities are designed to recreate southtonorth delivery capacity on the CNG system to substitute for looping service that has been purchased from Tennessee In support CNG claims first its proposal results in nearterm and longterm savings to its existing firm service customers without degrading service Second by not requiring assignees to maintain firm upstream entitlements to service on the Tennessee system the project will reduce the fixed cost burden for consumers downstream of CNGs LDC customers Third CNGs proposal eases the constraint for deliveries on CNGs system from southern receipt points to northern delivery points across the Valley Gate Junction located in central Pennsylvania CNG thus will be able to eliminate its standing mustflow operational flow order After placing the proposed facilities in service CNG will modify its tariff to eliminate the requirement that customers with North of Valley receipt points primarily CNGs interconnection with Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp at Leidy Pennsylvania can be directed to use their capacity to tender quantities of gas to CNG throughout the Winter Period Fourth the proposed construction will enable CNG to meet its existing market commitments During the first three years after the projected inservice date of this project less than of CNGs firm transportation capacity will be eligible to expire Fifth to the extent that markets can be served in the future either by CNGs own facilities or by the turnedback capacity that Tennessee accrues in its Zones through the CNG construction presents a competitive alternative Background CNGs longhaul contract with Tennessee provides for delivery of natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico plus reliance on an operational loop of CNGs system operated by Tennessee that allows CNG to offer more storage and transportation capacity than CNG could provide on its own In the aftermath of Order No however CNG unbundled its storage and transportation services and exited the merchant function CNG which no longer required a significant portion of the Tennessee capacity from the Gulf to Tennessees interconnections with CNG in Tennessee Zone agreed to assign its upstream capacity on Tennessee from the production area to a Zone transfer point South Webster while retaining the capacity from South Webster to delivery points interconnecting with CNG in Tennessee Zones and to facilitate dispatching and nonotice service to CNGs customers In conjunction with CNGs restructuring settlement one transaction on the Tennessee system thus was separated into two parts with CNG and its assignees paying Tennessee reservation and usage charges for the capacity as if Tennessee had a single customer from the Gulf to the market area Tennessee charged CNGs converting customers the applicable Zone delivery rate for transporting gas from Zones and to West Virginia and the South Webster transfer point CNG in turn is charged an incremental rate for transporting gas from South Webster to CNGs delivery points in Zone and determined by subtracting the maximum reservation and usage rates applicable to Tennessees Zone including applicable surcharges from the maximum reservation and usage rates including surcharges for the haul rate from the Gulf to either Zone or The incremental rate is approximately onethird of Tennessees maximum tariff rates for Rate Schedule FTA service from Zones to or Zones to respectively In negotiations to examine the fate of the expiring contract Tennessee conveyed to CNG that in order to preserve revenue neutrality the assigned upstream contract that feeds the CNGTennessee market contract No must match exactly the maximum daily quantity MDQ of the downstream contract Any mismatched quantities will be priced to CNG at Tennessees maximum tariff rates for FTA service Unless CNG were to require all assignees to continue to hold upstream capacity on the Tennessee system therefore CNG would no longer qualify for the incremental rate on Tennessee on the mismatched capacity retained by CNG Meanwhile as CNGs assignees have elected to turn back upstream Tennessee capacity CNGs costs would go up unless CNG chooses to turn back an equal quantity of service downstream of South Webster The cost increase on CNG to its customers if all assignees turned back would be approximately million per year CNG notified Tennessee on November that it will extend only a portion of its current contract for a oneyear period in order to accommodate a new CNG construction schedule The initial termination dates for CNGs customers upstream contracts all assigned from CNGs original contract with Tennessee were the same Absent the termination notice the contract provides for an automatic extension for a primary term of five years Proposal to Build Facilities Given the circumstances CNG proposes to build the facilities needed to serve its existing market without having to rely on Tennessee for the traditional looping service provided under this contract Thus CNGs customers would avoid the anticipated Tennessee cost increase that would result if CNG renewed the contract at Tennessees maximum rates Instead CNGs customers will experience an annual cost decrease as a result when compared to the transportation costs approved by the Commission in CNGs Docket TMOO CNG proposes to roll the costs of this project into CNGs general system transportation rates Such treatment the applicant argued is supported by the projected cost decrease to existing customers as well as by the systemwide benefits that will result The benefits outweigh any adverse impacts on the affected interests as examined pursuant to FERCs policy PL No subsidies exist under the circumstances as the facilities actually will prevent a cost increase to existing customers The proposed construction also makes certain cost reductions possible for all of the CNG customers that took assignment of upstream firm services on Tennessee during CNGs restructuring proceeding Accordingly CNG has met the Commissions policy threshold requirement to establish that its project satisfies the public convenience and necessity standard Pursuant to the Transportation Cost Recovery Adjustment TCRA terms in the settlement approved by the Commission on December CNG will continue to collect its TCRA at agreed levels a specified portion of which will be attributed to the costs of the project The annual cost of this project to CNGs firm transportation customers will be million which corresponds to the incremental payment that CNG had been making to Tennessee for Zones and firm transportation services through the TCRA CNG related that turnbacks are due to state retail unbundling initiatives that reduce the LDCs need to maintain pipeline capacity in support of a merchant role In addition increased liquidity in the commodity market largely because of Commission policies supporting market centers has increased opportunities to purchase gas in the market area These developments coupled with the potential for significant fixedcost savings motivated CNGs assignees to want to terminate upstream capacity contracts Therefore while CNG could have required its assignees to maintain upstream Tennessee capacity the proposed construction offers a more effective longterm mechanism to enable CNG to manage the risk of future cost increases for its customers The applicant said a recognized potential adverse impact on the captive customers of Tennessee who might face cost shifting is outweighed by the public benefits of CNGs proposal Moreover Tennessee need remarket only a portion of the former CNG marketarea capacity in order to recoup CNGs contribution to Tennessees revenue requirement Tennessee also has expressed confidence in its ability to secure markets for this newly available capacity In order to avoid unnecessary construction CNG indicated it conducted a reverse open season for two weeks during October in which CNG solicited customer interest in turning back firm service entitlements through an announcement on its electronic bulletin board No customer sought to turn back service entitlements in support of the proposed project To address potential landowner concerns CNG plans to construct this pipeline adjacent to an existing natural gas pipeline rightofway for which CNG already holds easement agreements CNG has also directly contacted each affected landowner and secured landowner authorization to conduct both engineering and environmental studies on of the proposed rightofway Copyright c Dow Jones
