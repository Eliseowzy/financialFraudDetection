are in Gary Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Bin Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does

KeithSukhi The following are my preliminary responses to Keiths email questions You can not be an xy customer under A and take Direct Access DA service through the same meter point Therefore to receive Western power and third party power other then PGE as an enduser retail load you must acquire DA service from PGE and become a scheduling customer with Western The key steps from Westerns perspective to becoming a Western scheduling customer involve modifying your Electric Service Contract and receiving agreement from PGE I would think you could accomplish these two items in no less than thirty days You appear to be familiar with the DASR process and timing to acquire DA service from PGE Western does provide Scheduling Agent services and does have a rate for this service It is approx per hour HOW MANY HOURS PER DAYMONTH WOULD BE TYPICAL CHARGE Pending the outcome of the PGE Filing before FERC passthru of costs incurred by PGE under A your SC could incur the typical CAISO charges for both Western power delivery and third party energy You will also be billed by PGE under their DA Tariff for delivery wheeling PGE has suggested to me in a recent phone conversation that if you are taking PGE DA service the A delivery service wheeling would no longer apply DOES THIS MEANS ET TD RATES APPLY TO WAPA DELIVERIES INCLUDING SURCHARGES Westerns scheduling customers receive monthly load factor energy as an energy entitlement EE based on a rolling average of their last five years of monthly historical usage EE are calculated using the customers total monthly peak capacity and total monthly energy and are updated annually I do not believe there are any exceptions to the methodology for determining EE ie year rolling average therefore the full benefit of your increased LF these next few years will take time to be fully realized As a scheduling customer you are required to take at least of your CRD in any hour or your total load whichever is less You may schedule of your CRD in any hour provided you have not exceeded your EE There are limits to the schedule differential between hours I will research and get back with you PLEASE CONFIRM THAT IT IS THE CUSTOMER OR ITS AGENT THAT DETERMINES HOURLY SCHEDULE WOULD DELIVERIES BE HANDLED AS AN SC TO SC TRANSFER BETWEEN WAPA AND ENRON IF NOT HOW WHAT IS TIMING REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY WAPA OF DA HOURLY SCHEDULE HOW ARE HOUR AHEAD CHANGES ACCOMMODATED I am unable to provide any thoughts on how the timing for making changes to Western power delivered to your SC for submission as a DA schedule would be handled at this time I will research and get back with you As a relatively smaller customer I do not believe that there would be much if any benefit to you or Western by participating in any of our load management programs The existing Western meter set is CAISO certified and we may be able to accommodate a third party polling the meter I will check into it Unsure of what you are asking in regards to off ramps Please clarify Russell Knight Western Area Power Administration Keith E Roberts plantUCDavisedu PM Hi Russell Bob Can we schedule a conference call for early next week between WAPA Bob Russell others UCD our Presidents office UCOP and Enron regarding the below info A WAPAUCD meeting may also be desirable I understand that Sukhi has been discussing with you the possibility of utilizing direct access instead of PGE bundled services to meet our peaking energy requirements ie the difference between our total needs and what WAPA and our cogen provide We are considering using the UCCSU blanket electricity contract with Enron to achieve direct access Below are some questions that we have regarding the potential switch but we are also extremely interested in hearing what you have to say regarding the issues at hand As I understand the process if UCD utilizes direct access DA then we will have to switch from XY to scheduling customer status correct If we have to switch to scheduling customer status what are the key steps and how long would each step take if we desire to switch quickly a DASR would have to be filed with PGE by July th in order for DA service to start on August if above is not doable then a DASR would have to be filed with PGE by Aug th in in order for DA service to start on September If UCD switches to scheduling status it is likely that WAPA would be our scheduling agent SA and Enron would be our scheduling coordinator SC What would be the differences in charges that we would incur from WAPA based on status quo Do you have any feeling for what charges would be incurred by PGE and ISO If UCD switches to DA would our MW CRD still receive the same transmission rates under A I understand that if we switch to scheduling status then our energy allocation will be fixed based on a year average load factor How does this math work How often is the year average load factor updated monthly yearly other UCD will have a new MW thermal storage system on line in the next few months which will dramatically improve our monthly load factor total kWh divided by product of peak demand and hrmon If we are required to use year average load factors instead of current load factors as is done with XY then the economic harm to UCD appears to be in the neighborhood of to per year Id like to petition using a forecasted load factor to detemine energy allocation so that this potential switch does not harm UCD How would I do this Is the MWh energy allocation that is determined through the above process a flat rate number that is used for each month of the year or does it vary monthbymonth based on water availability I believe it is flat through correct If we switch to scheduling status and if we have so many MWh allocated for the month how much flexibility is there for our SC to schedule the load The max schedulable load is our CRD correct What is the minimum schedulable load kW Are there any maximum ramp rates up or down ie can we go from kW AM to kW AM and kW PM to kW PM At what time are loads locked in ie can SC change schedule hr hr day before the actual hour As a scheduing customer we will have the capability to join WAPA load management programs do you see any potential benefits to UCD Is our Siemens TSI Quad meter available to be read by Enron What type of softwarehardware does WAPA use to read our meters Does this meter meet ISO protocols for revenue meters I believe that we are planning to ask for contractual offramps if A becomes untenable due to FERC or bankruptcy court decisions Your thoughts Can you think of any other contractual off ramps that should be pursued Thanks Keith Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent

Subject Importance High Sensitivity Confidential This was just forwarded to me by my mom You definitely only want to read this one during some quiet time yearold Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting It was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote He showed the essay titled The Room to his mother Beth before he headed out the door I wowed em he later told his father Bruce Its a killer Its the bomb Its the best thing I ever wrote It also was the last Brians parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenagers locker at Teary Valley High School Brian had been dead only hours but his parents desperately wanted every piece of his life near them the crepe paper that had adorned his locker during his senior football season notes from classmates and teachers his homework Only two months before he had handwritten the essay about encountering Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teens life But it was only after Brians death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized that their son had described his view of heaven It makes such an impact that people want to share it You feel like you are there Mr Moore said Brian Moore died May the day after Memorial Day He was driving home from a friends house when his car went off BulenPierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole He emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted Brian seemed to excel at everything he did He was an honor student He told his parents he loved them a hundred times a day Mrs Moore said He was a star wide receiver for the Tearys Valley Football team and had earned a fouryear scholarship to Capital University in Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities He took it upon himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school During one homecoming ceremony Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl he was escorting wouldnt be embarrassed about being taller than him He adored his kid brother Bruce now He often escorted his grandmother Evelyn Moore who lives in Columbus to church I always called him the deep thinker Evelyn said of her eldest grandson Two years after his death his family still struggles to understand why Brian was taken from them They find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried just a few blocks from their home They visit daily A candle and dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the gravesite The Moores framed a copy of Brians essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room I think God used him to make a point I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it Mrs Moore said of the essay She and her husband want to share their sons vision of life after death Im happy for Brian I know hes in heaven I know Ill see him again someday Mrs Moore said It just hurts so bad now The Room In that place between wakefulness and dreams I found myself in the room There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order But these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction had very different headings As I drew near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read Girls I have liked I opened it and began flipping through the cards I quickly shut it shocked to realize that I recognized the names written on each one And then without being told I knew exactly where I was This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life Here were written the actions of my every moment big and small in a detail my memory couldnt match A sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content Some brought joy and sweet memories others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching A file named Friends was next to one marked Friends I have betrayed The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird Books I Have Read Lies I Have Told Comfort I have Given Jokes I Have Laughed at Some were almost hilarious in their exactness Things Ive yelled at my brothers Others I couldnt laugh at Things I Have Done in My Anger Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents I never ceased to be surprised by the contents Often there were many more cards than I expected Sometimes fewer than I hoped I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards But each card confirmed this truth Each was written in my own handwriting Each signed with my signature When I pulled out the file marked Songs I have listened to I realized the files grew to contain their contents The cards were packed tightly and yet after two or three yards I hadnt found the end of the file I shut it shamed not so much by the quality of music but more by the vast time I knew that file represented When I came to a file marked Lustful Thoughts I felt a chill run through my body I pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size and drew out a card I shuddered at its detailed content I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded An almost animal rage broke on me One thought dominated my mind No one must ever see these cards No one must ever see this room I have to destroy them In insane frenzy I yanked the file out Its size didnt matter now I had to empty it and burn the cards But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor I could not dislodge a single card I became desperate and pulled out a card only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it Defeated and utterly helpless I returned the file to its slot Leaning my forehead against the wall I let out a long selfpitying sigh And then I saw it The title bore People I Have Shared the Gospel With The handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands I could count the cards it contained on one hand And then the tears came I began to weep Sobs so deep that they hurt They started in my stomach and shook through me I fell on my knees and cried I cried out of shame from the overwhelming shame of it all The rows of file shelves swirled in my tearfilled eyes No one must ever ever know of this room I must lock it up and hide the key But then as I pushed away the tears I saw Him No please not Him Not here Oh anyone but Jesus I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards I couldnt bear to watch His response And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face I saw a sorrow deeper than my own He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes Why did He have to read every one Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room He looked at me with pity in His eyes But this was a pity that didnt anger me I dropped my head covered my face with my hands and began to cry again He walked over and put His arm around me He could have said so many things But He didnt say a word He just cried with me Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files Starting at one end of the room He took out a file and one by one began to sign His name over mine on each card No I shouted rushing to Him All I could find to say was No no as I pulled the card from Him His name shouldnt be on these cards But there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive The name of Jesus covered mine It was written with His blood He gently took the card back He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards I dont think Ill ever understand how He did it so quickly but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side He placed His hand on my shoulder and said It is finished I stood up and He led me out of the room There was no lock on its door There were still cards to be written I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Phil For God so loved the world that He gave His only son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also My People I shared the gospel with file just got bigger how about yours A
