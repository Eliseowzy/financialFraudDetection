impact to any downstream processes I hope the following will give more clarification Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail Thanks dg Sitara Unify Process Scenario Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave

changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave

impact to any downstream processes I hope the following will give more clarification Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail Thanks dg Sitara Unify Process Scenario Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave

the Deal Validation group It gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back Impact to Logistics Unify If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets which are not in production yetEDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month cant remember the rules on this one but I think Unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force repathing Unify does have the ability to override duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response What are if any impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods repathing I have a call into Diane and Dave both After speaking w them hopefully I can get a clear understanding of the true impact I am sure well need to put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when

to Assignment Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with confirmed volumes Toms words of caution If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however I did add a warning message Warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback I assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems preUNIFY Some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal Before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline Sorry I dont know which pipes these are you will have to ask the UNIFY team There is one rule still in place you can change from ENAIM East to ENAIM Market East but not from ENAIM Texas to HPLCIM HPLC when changing business units they must be the same legal entity Warning not the same legal entity Also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals Transport Capacity Storage Cash Out Once the deal is invalidated there are no rules Dont forget the items were locked down for a reason If you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in UNIFY it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted Always check with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used

changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from Unify Impact zero impact to Logistics Volume Management absolutely harmless Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues Process Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline The new name ctprty B does bridge over to Unify Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify gui display does not change Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on path The Scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repath If repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path Unify pushes back the deal number meter to Sitara not ctprty info Balancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty info The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara where all information is correct Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly Settlements utilizes information in Unify Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entries If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occur note there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now Autonoms Toms words of warning Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated Basically it would change a key on an EDI path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline If the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem In most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume This is not an issue with Unify as explained above Dave

Friday November PM To DLGAallenronworldwide Subject Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy Today we announced plans to merge with Dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statementprospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available because it will contain important information Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statementprospectus when it is available and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron without charge at the SECs web site at wwwsecgov Copies of the joint proxy statementprospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statementprospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either Investor Relations Dynegy Inc Louisiana Suite Houston TX Phone Fax or Investor Relations Enron Corp Smith Street Houston TX Phone Fax In addition the identity of the persons who under SEC rules may be considered participants in the solicitation of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions and any description of their direct or indirect interests by security holdings or otherwise are available in an SEC filing under Schedule A made by each of Dynegy and Enron,farmer-d,Manager
