dream only of having my hand again FROM ANTHONY LOYD IN GOLBAHAR KARIMULLAH is an Afghan who does not want to relate his war story In a lan d where everyone is quick to tell their tale his silence makes him unique He stood alone in the narrow midday shadows of the hospital courtyard whe n I saw him yesterday a mix of glittering fury and blank despair He had h obbled into the Red Crosss orthopaedic centre in Golbahar on Saturday Eve n among the other amputees his injuries stood out Mines can take off both legs and both arms or the limbs of one side or more often just a singl e leg or foot Karimullahs injuries however had a different cause When reluctantly he had finished accounting for the loss of his left foot and right hand there was nothing to do but leave the man to his bladeeyed star e The son of Tajik parents now years old he fled Kabul when the Tale ban arrived in Moving north to a village in Northern Alliance territo ry with his wife and two children he found work in a vineyard But he lost his job and home to a Taleban advance in He joined the Mujahidin A shell hit his post on the Samali Plain in It killed four of his comr ades Karimullah escaped to a Pashtun village whose inhabitants handed him over to the Taleban Tried by a military tribunal in Kabul after torture he was sent to the citys Pulecharkhi jail for having served with the Alli ance I had been there weeks when three Talebs came into my cell he said They called my name out and said I was to be released Baffled but relieved Karimullah was led to a Datsun pickup They began driving me t o the Ghazi stadium Karimullah said I was silent at the beginning but as we neared it I asked What is this What of my release They told me Wait you will be released The Datsun drove into the centre of the stad ium Karimullah recalls thousands of faces staring at him in silence from t he stands and between and mullahs on chairs in a line in the middle of the field He was pulled from the truck and told to lie spreadeagled on the grass The mullahs didnt even ask my name or speak to the crowd Sev en doctors approached me They wore grey uniforms surgical masks and glove s I could see one was crying They injected me After five minutes my body was numb though I was still conscious Then they put clamps on my hand and foot and began to cut them off with special saws There was no pain but I could see what they were doing I asked him if he stared at the sky He t old me he was transfixed by the sight of his foot being removed There wa s a sigh and murmur from the crowd when they finished It had taken about f ive minutes Taleban guards threw me into the back of the pickup One was crying too Nothing was said Even now I am unaware why I was chosen for am putation He was taken to Kabuls Wazir Akbar Khan hospital After a week eight of his former prison guards visited him They brought him apples and afghanis They apologised They told me they had not known what would happen I threw the money and apples back at them I screamed t hat they had told me I would be released and instead had taken my foot and hand for nothing They left On the tenth day he was discharged A taxi t ook him to his parents home They had no idea what had happened to him K arimullahs eightyearold sister Razia answered the taxidrivers knock on the door She burst into tears when she saw her brother sprawled in the back of the cab Worse was to follow My mother had been ill for some time so was very weak When she saw me she collapsed She regained consciousne ss for a few hours but then had a heart attack and died I thought the w orst day of my life had been in the stadium Coming home was worse Her nam e was Masherin She was He became a beggar his mutilation carrying w ith it the stigma and shame of the punishment normally meted out to a thief Then a few weeks ago a cousin a Mujahidin commander got a message th rough the lines offering him help Borrowing a spare prosthetic leg from a mine victim in Kabul Karimullah limped northwards for days crossing the f ront with other refugeesThe Red Cross is preparing a prosthetic leg for hi m but some scars cannot be repaired I am finished I have no future K arimullah said I have had everything taken from me by the Taleban Before they came to Kabul I was a student in the tenth grade an educated man wit h some chances before me Someone told me a rich Pashtun had committed a crime and paid the corrupt mullahs to use a prisoner of war for public ampu tation instead of himself I dont know if its true But I hate them I dream only of having my hand again so I could carry a gun and go to the fro nt line and kill and kill Id kill them all every Taleb and every mullah Acopyrightlink color Acopyrightvisited color Acopyrighthover color Copyright

From Jones Brad Sent Tuesday November AM To Song Jennifer Subject RE vol skew Thank you very much that is exactly what I wanted to know Yes if the IF vol curve exists use IFvol NG skew if IF vol curve does not exsist use NG vol NG skew Original Message From Song Jennifer Sent Tuesday November AM To Jones Brad Subject vol skew Brad I did two postids I used the current production portcalc to calculate and I used the old version to calculate I do see a P L change on I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P L value Enclosed is a partial list of those deals The reasons are In old version we calculate volatility of basis options like this we calculate the NG volatility If its a basis option we fetch the IF volatility curve If IF volatility curve exists we use IFvolatility curve If IF volatility curve does not exist we still use NG volatility In the current production version we calculate volatility of basis options like this we calculate the NG volatility NG vol skew The NG vol skew is based on NG price fixed price If its a basis option we fetch the IFvolatility curve If IFvolatility curve exists we use IF volatility curve If IFvolatility curve does not exist we still use NG volatility NG vol skew which was calculated in step The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step we didnt apply vol skew upon IF vol In our new fix this bug will be fixed However the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist So the current production version used the NG vol NG vol skew for those deals The old version used the NG vol for those deals Thus you see PL change in these two versions Also wed like to confirm with you that in the new fix if the IF vol curve does not exist you still want us to use NG vol NG vol skew instead of erroring out If the IF vol curve exists we will use IF vol NG vol skew Thanks Jennifer Jinwen Jennifer Song File basisxls ,may-l,Director
