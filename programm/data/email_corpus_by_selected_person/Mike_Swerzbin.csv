Wednesday May AM To Subject My mothers service Mike and Helen Thanks very much for attending my mothers service Sydney and I are sorry we did not get to spend more time with you during my time in Portland I will make sure to contact you next time I am coming into town I have enclosed a residency newsletter I sent out to all of the faculty and residents summarizing my eulogy to my mother I thought it would be useful as an educational tool as we all unfortunately have to go through this at some point Please feel free to share it with whomever you wish One of the things I have learned the most through all of this is the importance of sharing Take care I want to thank everyone who has written to me via mail or Email regarding the recent death of my mother This has been a growth experience for me Although I am emotionally devastated I have learned a tremendous amount about life in the last few weeks and months Since this topic is one we all must face at some time in our lives I thought sharing some of this would be helpful for myself and also for those of you who have either faced it in the past or will in the future It is really a tribute to my mother a former schoolteacher as this was her last lesson for me The following is a summary of my eulogy to her at her memorial service What I Learned Reflections on my Mothers Life True Love My mother and I had a volatile relationship during part of my life Like many people I was very selfcentered during my late teens and most of my twenties I did well in my professional life but I was not very giving in my relationships either girlfriends or family My mother was not shy to point out her disappointment with these behaviors and we had many heated discussions during that time period I have noticed that many friends have had volatile relationships with their closest parent I have learned that true love is about passion for the other person One cannot be silent when you believe changes need to be made Some of the hard times draw you even closer later in life Ultimately my mother was right I am very proud of my s and grateful that she was able to witness my maturation as a person Grief Of course I have learned a lot about grief Grief is about you In the last few days of her life there were many tears Almost all were mine My mother had accepted her fate and had a strong Christian faith She was primarily worried about the effect her death would have on my sister and I The vacant spot in your heart and life cannot be measured It will be a wound that cannot heal as you progress in your life and cannot directly share it with your loved one It will come in waves triggered by various thoughts and activities as if it was a neurologic disorder All I can say as comfort to those who have not experienced it is this When the unthinkable happens and you lose what you cannot bear to consider losing your life is permanently changed However not all of the changes will be towards the abyss of permanent melancholy that you assume will occur There will be growth and understanding There will be spiritual and emotional opportunity Friends and family will step up to the plate for you More on this later Role Models Like most young boys my idols as a child were the typical sport stars people who did larger than life things that I had never met I tried to pursue the usual goals of the young American male I wanted to be physically attractive well rounded and intelligent and economically prosperous I wanted to have it all As I grow older my definition for having it all has changed My father is an incredible man He lost his left arm at the shoulder in a hunting accident age twelve Despite this he did everything a person with two arms could do and sometimes even better My friends looked at him as an incredible inspiration I did not pay as much attention to my mothers attributes She was simply an incredible giving person The unfortunates the lonely the downtrodden never went unnoticed by my mother She cultivated friends and family like a good farmer cultivates crops The rewards of this became obvious to me as I spent more time with her in the last few years People visited her constantly People called about her constantly People did things for her constantly People prayed for her and loved her constantly I never would have thought that as I approach my most important role model would be a frail woman who spent a lot of time in a wheel chair I will never be the same after going through this with her For that I will always be grateful Glass Half Full Person My favorite quote from my mother is I am having a good day This was what I always heard when I would phone her to check on her which I did daily the last year For my mom seeing a nice arrangement of flowers visiting with a relative or neighbor these were the things that made life grand As one gets busier and busier I think one tends to become a glass half empty person more and more Accomplishments just lead to more deadlines The focus is on what you dont have rather than what you have Perspective can become fatally altered I notice the flowers more the kindness I see more the sights and smells of the world more and appreciate the life I have built more rather than focusing on the life I want to build This is probably the most important lesson my mother taught me Caregivers As a person in the medical profession I witness care giving every day However until you have participated in it yourself particularly with a loved one you have not really lived The intimacy you get with the person who you make meals for wash for and help with ADLs is not describable You develop little rituals that you look forward to as much as the person you do it for It takes a special type of person to do this kind of work fulltime Those moments with my mother will sustain me the rest of my life no matter what happens to me Priorities We all think everything we do is the most important thing on this planet Going through this I realize that nothing is more important in your life than your family Dr Krupski said it best when I came into his office in tears several times needing to go home to be with my mother this last year He said Ten years from now you will not remember what paper you wrote what operation you did what talk you gave But you will always remember and treasure the time with your mother Go home He was right and I will never be able to repay him for the ability to spend time with her FriendshipsNeighbors As I stated my mother was excellent at cultivating these relationships It is really not rocket science it just requires your time and being open I was amazed that she kept contact with friends from high school years till the day of her death They would get together regularly In the modern world this is very unusual Perhaps it is because we all have distorted priorities In addition she had a very tight bond with her neighbors I remember we had all of the neighbor kids playing at our house regularly because of the size of our yard One day a boy broke his leg clearly an immediate lawsuit today but that did not stop the neighborhood kids My mother was on hospice months before she officially went on the list It was the neighborhood hospice They would drive her places fix her plumbing and mow her lawn all for free They would bring food come visit and share their lives with her It was an incredible thing to see Courage My mother spent the last months of her life with an hematocrit between and She rarely complained She mustered the strength in the last year to attend my sisters wedding her high school reunion and shop for holidays and decorate the house for Christmas She went to restaurants with friends A month before her death she went to lunch with me twice went on a trip to a local waterfall and went shopping at the local center She did all of this with a hematocrit of Seventeen is the number I will always remember when I am tired and wishing I could sleep but the life and job I have requires my time Acceptance How does one learn to live with the unthinkable Well I have come to understand many things The worst part of chronic illness is watching your loved one slowly fade over time However they are so miserable at the end that having them leave is more acceptable My mother had a tremendous faith and I know she is in a better place I have changed as a person based on the above reflections and I understand that part of her will always live on through my life and actions It is a time of great emotion but also great opportunity Many friends and family come out to support you which allow a chance to reunite past relationships with others My sister and I have become very close through all of this That would make my mother proud and happy Memorial services and the like are all about celebration of life There are tears but most of remembrance is the honor of sharing the persons life I know my mother more now than I ever did I have hours of her on video to share with my future children so they can know her too I am the product of two schoolteachers They were awesome teachers and not surprisingly awesome parents Much of what we are comes from those that raised us I did not understand that before I do now Thanks for allowing me to share some of my mothers life with you Hopefully it will be as meaningful to you

A WINDFALLPROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATES WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT PM PDT AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH COINCIDENCE PROBABLY BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDNT BE IGNORED THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY OF CALIFORNIAS ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH THIS WEEKS WINDFALLPROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS GOV GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN CONT MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATES MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY THE MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT AND THE GENERATORS WERENT IMPRESSED AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS RELIANT ENERGYS REI JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE GENERATION IN THE STATE THE STATES LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS POINT CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN AND NOBODY HAS PROVED OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES WMB FOR ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT ITS LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME THEN AFTER YOU BEAT THEM THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE THE UTILITIES THE ISO AND NOW THE CONT STATE TREASURY TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR BOTH THE WINDFALLPROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE BUT THOSE WHO INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO OBVIOUSLY PRICE CAPS HAVENT WORKED JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME IN FACT PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE WRONG DISEASE AT BEST PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES CALIFORNIAS PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES IT CANT AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED THE INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTERBASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASNT EXACTLY IBMS BIG BLUE VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES HUMAN TRADERS COULD CONT HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY HUMANS BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM FOR EXAMPLE IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY ITS LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST MARYS SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE AND YEAR CONTRACTS IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DONT HAVE TRADING EXPERIENCE GOOD IDEAS MEANWHILE HAVE LANGUISHED CONT WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REALTIME PRICING DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS ON FEB THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA FROM THE GOVERNORS OFFICE TO DATE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REALTIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIAS BIG BUSINESSES SINCE THEN NOTHING THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS SPECIAL SAID STANFORD ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE THEN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT MEGAWATTS OF LOAD HAVE REALTIME METERS EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES SAID WOLAK CONT ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE SELLERS KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND THE TIME OF DAY WOLAK SAYS AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME BUT MAKING OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING CHANCE IN THE MARKET ACCORDING TO WOLAK BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT PRICE CAPS A WINDFALLPROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO SELL OR SLIP THROUGH IN SACRAMENTO BY MARK GOLDEN DOW JONES NEWSWIRES MARK

emailArticlegif Energy Department energy statistics File printArticlegif IMAGE IMAG E IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE GEORGE Wash Doing something nice for California has never been a priority here in the Columbia River Basin where highvoltage power lines lope across irrigated fields of alfa lfa potatoes and wheat Politicians from California as farmers in this area will explain at great length have been scheming for decades to sipho n off the basins cheap electricity and water Californians however ha ve been noticeably less irritating as of late Having fouled up electricit y deregulation six ways from Sunday they are skidding into the summer air conditioning season desperately short of power In the last year much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River whose monstrous dams ar e the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America All along the r iver from Portland Ore to British Columbia utility companies aluminu m makers and farmers have joined to help save California but at a stagge ring price Charging whatever Californias dysfunctional power market will bear people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia With their record profits some public util ities are wiring the emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics bu ying diesel generators to make still more power and paying Wall Streetsty le wages to electricity traders while making sure that their electricit y rates remain among the cheapest in North America Just north of the bord er in British Columbia a stateowned utility luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to million customers Their go od fortune though has come with a measure of ambivalence and may well be shortlived A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the regio n If it continues utilities along the river will have to buy power and m ay be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall This is not nice money said Alice Parker a retired farmer who heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin It is something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their aircondition ers Nice or not a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County a publicly owned utili ty that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last y ear than it ever had before With just local customers the utility last year had a million profit It paid its two top power traders each an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less than a year The utility refuses to reveal the traders name s for fear their children might be kidnapped The chief operating office r of Chelan County Public Utility District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were huge and obscene But the executive Charles J Hosken added We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our customer owners Next door in equally sparse Grant County a pub lic utility that also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more mon ey maximizing the market It had a record million in profits last y ear more than double its best previous year Grant County Public Utility District which has just retail customers is using its windfall t o help build a million fiber optic network for local residents It has also bought diesel generators to guard against power shortages and if possible exploit the power goldrush The utility estimates that those generators could add million to profits in the coming year Like Chela n Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to insulate i ts customers from high market prices for electricity when as now local needs exceed generating capacity in the river Power rates in Grant and Ch elan Counties are about onefifth as much as in New York City Grant Coun tys utility has rejected for the time being the idea of giving a share of its profits to its customers How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people are paying more for electricity asked Lon Topaz director of resource management for the utility It would be lousy politics An UpsideDown Economy The secondworst drought on re cord in the Columbia River Basin has combined with Californias deregulati on mess to further distort the energy market Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be sold on the spot market to times as much as last years price it has strengthened a compell ing bottomline rationale for conservation Every megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest often at lockedin long term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate can be sent south to California Fo r many utilities conservation spells local savings and a longdistance bo nanza As a result a regional economy built on half a century of cheap h ydropower has been stood on its head Irrigation farmers here are being pa id up to an acre not to farm Similarly aluminum companies are coll ecting about billion this year by not making aluminum Companies like Alcoahave earned profits that delight Wall Street while keeping about workers on their payroll by reselling hydropower that they bought in the mids under a cheap longterm contract Even residential custom ers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars from the power crunch AvistaUtilities has announced that it will pay its customers in Washingt on and Idaho cents for every kilowatt they do not use if their consumpt ion falls more than percent below last years level For utilities in the Northwest by far the largest profits from Californias electricity cr isis have been secured in British Columbia A number of private American u tilities have also benefited from Californias troubles BC Hydro a uti lity owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and Peace Rivers is the first corporation in the history of the province to exceed bill ion in profits as measured in Canadian currency million
