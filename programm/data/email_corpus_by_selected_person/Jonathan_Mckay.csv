AM To Mckay Jonathan Chase Tolle Email Subject Nice BACK FOR SECONDS Houston again named fattest city in America by national magazine By DANIEL J VARGAS Copyright Houston Chronicle Isnt it just like Houston to go for seconds This titlecraving city has been named the fattest plumpest most rotund city in America by Mens Fitness for a second consecutive year Weigh to go Fattest cities Houston Chicago Detroit Philadelphia Dallas Columbus Ohio San Antonio Fort Worth St Louis Indianapolis Fittest cities Colorado Springs Colo Denver San Diego Seattle San Francisco Virginia Beach Va Honolulu Sacramento Calif Albuquerque NM Boston Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free the magazine writes Last year Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective angry mother In the message is soaking in like a juicy halfpound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun The first year we were kind of upset because we werent happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people cant control says Shadston Pittman fitness coordinator for the citys Parks and Recreation Department This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now I think we can show the world weight loss is a priority for us But they still got us Again In fact Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor Sorry they came in th I didnt think wed be number one because of the proactive steps we took he says For the countrys largest cities the magazine took existing data and issued grades in categories such as overweight and obesity rates D air quality F TV viewing habits F water quality D parks and open space D nutrition B and climate C When the grades were tallied Houston once again found itself at the head of the class albeit the one with all the detentionserving kids The Mens Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday Meanwhile we apparently should hit the treadmill Not to be outdone other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side Dallas ranked fifth San Antonio was seventh Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at th The only Texas city on the light side was Austin ranked as the th fittest The fittest city was Colorado Springs Colo Karen Calabro coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of TexasHouston Health Science Center says although she doesnt put much stock into the magazines formula Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds We could all lose some weight Me included the registered dietitian says Houston Calabro says isnt the only city with a caloricintake and sedentary epidemic Nationally percent of adults are overweight or obese according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute As your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure heart disease or diabetes Calabro says A big part of this obesity problem she says is that were not exercising not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk We opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name We see escalators as our new best friend And we drive to the corner store for ice cream But Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image After Houston earned the first unsolicited title Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia which owned the fattest ranking in Philly started a citywide campaign called Fun Fit and Free to get its residents to slim down Last year Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place Pittman who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year says Houstons version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphias However there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible The citys getfit effort will kick off Jan when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston The problem is so serious that Subway is sending its biggun spokesman to the Jan event From am to pm outside City Hall Smith participants can meet Jared Fogle who lost pounds on a diet of lowfat lowcalorie Subway sandwiches and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a twoweek free membership to Bally Total Fitness That Jareds a nice guy Pittman says Thats his fulltime job now People would agree that losing weight is a fulltime task The city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the Five a Day message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day That effort kicks off Jan Were not saying everyone has to run miles a day around Memorial Park Pittman says Were talking just simple lifestyle changes Later this year Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called Shape Up Texas to improve health and wellness among Texans Thats not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up percent of the fat list and four of the top eight Mayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall Brown who has put on a few pounds since taking office says he isnt surprised by Houstons expansive reputation Im afraid Ive contributed to that he says Brown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more However he wouldnt reveal how much weight he planned to shed Pittman applauds the mayors words about weight loss Its great when you have someone of that stature visibly being a speaker for health and fitness he says The last thing we want is a threepeat
