and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this I want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary Thanks Steve Original Message From ENRON Sent Tuesday October AM To Harris Steven Subject ECS Contract Review New Idea Steve I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my time hour normal rate is I would like to send you an engagement letter this week for up to weeks or hours k I think we can get it done in less time but the hours provides some flexibility if we decide to go deeper on something we would only charge you for the hours we use I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring options as well as the NPV Income and operational effect for each To the extent time allows I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever option you choose In order for me to offer our preferred rate it is important to note that I would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis eg Friday meetings emails and phone vs being onsite weeks fulltime Even with this flexible structure I feel confident that we can have the deliverable complete by mid December Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these terms As for the new idea I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset positionmarket intelligence It occurred to me that there is an analogy here that relates to pipelines Pipelines have operational events that may have market effects Unplanned outage majorminordurationnotice Planned outages over a certain volume Operation flow order SOLs Key Plants backed in Takes over schedule volumes key points Linepack levels Pressure drops at key points Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through gas needed for operational purchases it is rationale that these phenomena would be studied and acted read traded upon in order to minimize TWs market risk read generate income TW can setup a risk management group to execute this idea It is not unusual for a pipeline to have a risk management function Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of Risk Management for Pipelines These events would be studied in the follow way Determine whether there is a correlation between an event and gas pricesbasis differentials based on historical data For those events that have a strong correlations develop a trading strategy around the relationship Backtest the trading strategy against historical data determine profitability For operational events that are applicable setup a system to execute program trading that is directly linked to SCADA Secondary benefits of this risk management trading strategy would be developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling the capacity physical vs through basis derivatives or some combination of both Steve if you are interested in this idea I can start drawing up a workplan for this study Dave David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas Forwarded by David A FotiInternalAccenture on AM David A Foti To PM cc Subject Contract Review MM RCM Steve I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options If your team is available I could come by next Friday midmorning or later to start discussing with them On the administrative side I am working to nail down the lowest hourly rate I can get for you I would probably propose something like hours rate in the engagement letter This amount of time should be adequate to put together a short study on your different options I will send you a engagement letter this week I would just need to get that signed by you before Friday Also please let me know if you need any other information on the Reliability Centered Maintenance idea as you prepare to talk to the other officers Dave David A Foti

all of next week Thanks Steve Original Message From ENRON Sent Wednesday October PM To Harris Steven Subject TW Earnings Idea Twist on ECS Deals Hello Steve Havent talked to you in a while hope all is well A quick update I moved over from EES to Accentures Energy group about six months ago and have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management Pipeline Optimization projects I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting Accenture has a strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered Maintenance RCM basically an advanced methodology technology for making maintenance decisions They are the standard for electric TD companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment This is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal TW hires Accenture to implement RCM RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project weeks Accenture pays TW upfront for years of projected benefits from RCM say MM as part of our guarantee TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the next years which will flow into the next rate case I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante so I am around the Enron building Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss further Hope all is well Dave mobile David A Foti Accenture Allen Parkway Suite Houston Texas This message is for the designated recipient only and

The marketers can go out and start selling the project but are having a hard time defining how the capacity will be allocated I left a message ye sterday for Mary K regarding these same issues Thanks Drew Fossum PM ToSusan ScottET NRON Mary Kay MillerETS NRON Keith nronXGate ccShelley nronXGate Maria nronXGate Steve n HarrisET NRON Jeffery FawcettET NRON Kevin HyattET nron Lorraine LindbergET NRON SubjectTW Expansion There were several questions left for legalregulatory to work on at the cl ose of our meeting today Ill try to restate them and add my initial tho ughts so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems Q Can TW use negotiated rate agreements for its new mmd expansion A Yes Independence Guardian and other new pipeline projects were cert ificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts The only restriction i s that we need to always offer costbased recourse rate service as an alter native to negotiated rates We hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire mm of capacity but we wont know until the contracts are ex ecuted how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts I guess that means that in the cert app we just tell the commission that we will be at risk and that g iven the huge interest in the open season we have no doubts about our abil ity to sell the full We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contract s or a combination of both Q Can we give prospective customers a cafeteria style menu of options to steal Jeffs term like the following yr neg rate deal at a locked in plus fuel and surcharges o r whatever number we decide on y neg rate deal at a locked in plus fuel and surcharges yr neg rate deal at a locked in blah blah yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges importantl y this option is not locked in and will float with TWs actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages A I think the answer here is yes Whatever options we come up with for and we will always have to offer as well Susan and Steve Stoj ic please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated ra te options and stick to them Otherwise this negotiated rate approach cou ld get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking ou r specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations like a yr day contract at for example Im not sure that would be a bad thing but we need to think about it We need to be sure we can t ell a customer no and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by askin g for the yr term and the rate for example I think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a no substitutions policy this is sticking with the cafeteria theme but we need to be sure Q If we can use the cafeteria options approach how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options A This one is hard We need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options is solely within our discretion We dont want t o be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option a t instead of Susan and Steve if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a bet ter deal than the recourse option for most shippers Ie could we deli berately incent shippers to sign on for the short term dealsie by off ering options at and instead of the and shown above I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to obtain subscription under neg rate deals Q How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply A Ideally wed be able to allocate the to the guys who want to buy i t the way wed prefer to sell it Under the above example assuming Stan Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better what if we get mmd of offers on each of the rateterm options described above Thats mmd of demand for a mmd project Can we sell to the guys who wan t option yrs and the remaining to the yr guys That really hoses the recourse bidders Do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else Pro rata to everyone Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation pro rata to everyone may be the right answer Or at least its the answer until weve filled the recourse rate guys orders then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg rate guys whose bids we value most highly using some objective nondi scriminatory calculation of course Ugh Susan and Steveplease take a crack at questions I think is answer ed already I havent done any research yet so maybe these questions are easier than they currently seem to me Get me and MKM on the phone at your convenience to discuss Weve gotta move quick so the marketers can get o ut and sell this stuff DF

Douglass ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESDanDouglassCdouglassenergyattorney EcomE NRONcom Sent Tuesday October PM To Pryor Tony Subject SoCalGas Developments Tony SoCalGas sent out last week a copy of its new Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding BCAP application The nominal purpose of the filing is to revise rates for gas service effective and to revise rates to reflect an updated allocation among customers of noncommodity costs of service The utility also requests authority to revise and simplify various tariffs and to implement several new programs which will enhance the efficient use and operation of its gas transportation system I am calling this to your attention because I recommend that Transwestern monitor this proceeding review the application and determine how active if at all it may wish to be in this proceeding The utility will be forecasting both gas demand and gas prices during presenting two cost allocation studies and two rate proposals They will also be proposing that the Commission switch from long run marginal cost to embedded cost principles for allocating costs of service among its customers The also propose a million or rate increase annually compared to present rates The utility discusses in detail the issues of interstate pipeline capacity and storage reservation for the core and the projected annual cost of the core interstate pipeline capacity reservation Their capacity issues witness advocates continued core responsibility for its portion of the ITCS He also makes proposals designed to enhance customer access to SoCalGas transmission and storage assets some of which were surfaced initially in the context of the Natural Gas Strategy proceeding He proposes firm intrastate receipt points an open season to solicit interest in an expansion of the backbone system a new inkind fuel charge for transmission and an expansion of the unbundled storage program to include gas loaning services finally they also propose incremental expansions of both transmissionand storage capacity Tony it seems to me that Transwestern should monitor this proceeding review the application thoroughly including a supplement that SoCalGas says it will be filing soon and make a decision as to whether the proposed changes will affect the SoCalGasTranswestern relationship andor the relationships between Transwestern and its shippers You can then decide whether monitoring is sufficient or if you need to participate One last thing Yesterday the Southern California Generation Coalition SCGC submitted a motion to supplement the Phase II record in the OII proceeding SCGC noted that the OII has discussed SoCalGas requested approval of Advice Letters Nos and SCGC argued in both its opening and reply brief that Schedule GTF clearly requires SoCalGas to provide firm full requirements service to customers electing that service option Alternatively SCGC argued that to the extent Schedule GTF is ambiguous it must be construed in favor of customers in the Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys However the SoCalGas BCAP Application described above submits proposed revisions to Schedule GTF SCGC complains that SoCalGas did not disclose in its reply brief the fact that it was seeking in its BCAP Application to revise the language of Schedule GTF The motion states that The additional language SoCalGas has added to Schedule GTF clearly constitutes an admission through conduct by SoCalGas that Schedule GTF is not clear on its face It constitutes an admission that Schedule GTF as now constituted needs to be clarified It admits that Schedule GTF is ambiguous and in making that admission resolves the ambiguity SCGC then requests the record be reopened to reflect these facts Let me know what you would like to do with regard to the SoCalGas applicationand please pass this on to Steve Harris for his information Thanks Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel Fax File mailto LADOC File LADOC This

its gas transportation system I am calling this to your attention because I recommend that Transwestern monitor this proceeding review the application and determine how active if at all it may wish to be in this proceeding The utility will be forecasting both gas demand and gas prices during presenting two cost allocation studies and two rate proposals They will also be proposing that the Commission switch from long run marginal cost to embedded cost principles for allocating costs of service among its customers The also propose a million or rate increase annually compared to present rates The utility discusses in detail the issues of interstate pipeline capacity and storage reservation for the core and the projected annual cost of the core interstate pipeline capacity reservation Their capacity issues witness advocates continued core responsibility for its portion of the ITCS He also makes proposals designed to enhance customer access to SoCalGas transmission and storage assets some of which were surfaced initially in the context of the Natural Gas Strategy proceeding He proposes firm intrastate receipt points an open season to solicit interest in an expansion of the backbone system a new inkind fuel charge for transmission and an expansion of the unbundled storage program to include gas loaning services finally they also propose incremental expansions of both transmissionand storage capacity Tony it seems to me that Transwestern should monitor this proceeding review the application thoroughly including a supplement that SoCalGas says it will be filing soon and make a decision as to whether the proposed changes will affect the SoCalGasTranswestern relationship andor the relationships between Transwestern and its shippers You can then decide whether monitoring is sufficient or if you need to participate One last thing Yesterday the Southern California Generation Coalition SCGC submitted a motion to supplement the Phase II record in the OII proceeding SCGC noted that the OII has discussed SoCalGas requested approval of Advice Letters Nos and SCGC argued in both its opening and reply brief that Schedule GTF clearly requires SoCalGas to provide firm full requirements service to customers electing that service option Alternatively SCGC argued that to the extent Schedule GTF is ambiguous it must be construed in favor of customers in the Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys However the SoCalGas BCAP Application described above submits proposed revisions to Schedule GTF SCGC complains that SoCalGas did not disclose in its reply brief the fact that it was seeking in its BCAP Application to revise the language of Schedule GTF The motion states that The additional language SoCalGas has added to Schedule GTF clearly constitutes an admission through conduct by SoCalGas that Schedule GTF is not clear on its face It constitutes an admission that Schedule GTF as now constituted needs to be clarified It admits that Schedule GTF is ambiguous and in making that admission resolves the ambiguity SCGC then requests the record be reopened to reflect these facts Let me know what you would like to do with regard to the SoCalGas applicationand please pass this on to Steve Harris for his information Thanks Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel Fax File mailto LADOC File LADOC This
