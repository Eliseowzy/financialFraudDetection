problem adding a subtype on the ITs of SBA Im not sure I understand your last bullet Can you give me more info LT Original Message From Cabrera Reyna Sent Tuesday August PM To Neville Sue Medeles Gerry Cc Threet Kay Bodnar Michael Trevino Linda Subject SBA Priority during Allocations Sue During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations some of the following issues came up Gerry correct me if I misunderstood anything If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority at Primary Points Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate Might have some mad shippers How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation Interruptible Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as SBA IT This is for the future contracts system Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria Reyna Cabrera ,blair-l,Director

Gerry Cc Threet Kay Bodnar Michael Trevino Linda Subject SBA Priority during Allocations Sue During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations some of the following issues came up Gerry correct me if I misunderstood anything If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority at Primary Points Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate Might have some mad shippers How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation Interruptible Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as SBA IT This is for the future contracts system Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria Reyna Cabrera ,blair-l,Director

Subject RE Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the th work day close so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings Even if they were it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a day chart Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined On these types of installations how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet todays business needs so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists and identify the costs to resolve the problem Thanks Gary Original Message From Zadow Raetta Sent

rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume The reason for this is because especially in the winter time this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe If these charts cannot be read daily what can we do to make it so that they can Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations Thanks

To Blair Lynn January Steven Nacey Sheila Dietz Rick Holmes Bradley Corman Shelley Subject NGI Publication concerning TW Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates see Daily GPI Aug subscribersdailynewsdehtml In fact he believes the preposting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned million from Sempra Energys contract in March million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged,blair-l,Director

Michael Sent Tuesday July PM To Kenagy Gary Cc Dietz Rick Floyd Jodie Ratliff Dale Subject RE From the Gas Logistics weekly report Gary for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NNG north or south end We will log the ticket as a Hot Seat entry He will need to give us a little description meter number and the techs name and location for the log entry purposes You can see that Mike wants to document and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customers measurement and affect UAF PPAs As we originally discussed this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in GMS George does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems We dont want to duplicate efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to NNG Market Services Management Measurement Specialist Measurement Operations NNG Marketing Gas Control IT NNG Field Operations George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station north or south If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech It would be good if George would give us updates on physicalsoftware repairs Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at AM That is up to him He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work Tks Mike W Original Message From Kenagy Gary Sent Tuesday

announcing the official formation of the NNG Measurement Desk within Gas Logistics later on this week An external message will follow Once the external customers are made formally aware of the desk and the number is published we will pick up a lot more activity on potential measurement issues I would like to send out the log weekly to Shelley yourself Rick Dietz the Directors Measurement Specialist Field Operation Teams GMS NNG Gas Control IT and anyone else that should be in the loop I will be sending the log out for the first time this week We also believe that we will have much more problem identification with a network trouble tracking system is in place that is web based and interactive Once we have a better trouble tracking tool than our current Excel spreadsheet log we will be able to be much more proactive with the help we will receive from the IT Hot Seat and GMS The Hot Seat within Gas Control will soon be a hour function so they will be monitoring many of the EFM scanning functions telemetry and in a position to give us a heads up of potential measurement issues that we will troubleshoot and track to resolution GMS will also be able to access the log and

After confirmations are available Today we currently generate a new posting for Operationally Available every minutes to keep it constantly updated But if we go to times daily when does she set the time to generate and post Im probably not the one to answer this Someone needs to make the call which of the two times would be correct one to post Another issue is when we have system problems and the time gets thrown off and it has a set time to run wouldnt this skew the available capacity numbers This was my email to Jeanie last week They are generally set times but there are times when we are having TMS system problems that the times have to be pushed up But as a general rule the times that TMS cycles run are This is for TW Evening Cycle Runs at approximately pm and confirmations run

Italian visitor Mauro Formaggio Rick as I mentioned to you last week I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer The first one is Mauro Formaggio Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline despatching operation commercial scheduling of transmission nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities Please see this email below He has not yet decided the dates but he is aiming at last week of August for days I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this and I would coordinate Formaggios meeting Alfredo Im scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA in the month of August The aspects Im considering are how OBAs are organized and how they are applied the operation of hubs the balancing penalties the trading of capacity the general operation of a big pipeline the general operation of a state pipeline and of a LDC the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader in Atlanta on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper on many pipelines and storages and to another major shipper and producer in Houston on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities as well as on the access practice A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework To my opinion Northern would be all right It should act as a model to what could also be arranged with time by big transmission operators in our country It could refer to the dispatching operation and to the commercial scheduling of transmission to the nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities If possible two days would be a proper duration I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person so there would be no need of formal presentations The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right In the past when I was in Snam I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa So I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system Last time was some years ago when I visited Transcanada in Calgary for a week focusing on nomination and balancing Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years there were EL Paso PGE Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me As for the period it would be in the second half of August because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do here in Milano Thank you and best regards Mauro Dear Alfredo Im finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice there Among of meetings Im going to arrange it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline Northern seems to me a good example Would you envisage it as a possible example for me I would discuss the organization of dispatching see the nomination and balancing operation the allocation of measurement and other major aspects of TPA implementation including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines for transmission and storage Im considering the end of August for such a visit Owing to the extent of the

Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Ive talked with Vernon I can see Daris point Since I will be out of town when final allocated volumes come out Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual if necessary to override the max overrun OVA rate with the firm rate When I get back I will create tariff exceptions reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight The MIDtoMID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month If shipper flows more than overrun overall on any day discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits Affects contracts Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID A providing a discount on the first day on and day for In practice TAS will discount the first or day on each individual path If flows overrun on each of different MID to MID A paths in a day TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of Another Question Vernon Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to of the contract MDQ on a daily basis or on a monthly basis For example on MDQ so Is it your intention to discount only up to overrun each day or would you discount up to Overrun for the month regardless of daily flow levels Original Message From Mercaldo Vernon Sent Thursday December AM To Dornan Dari Bianchi Rita Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Cc Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Rita Not to complicate things but they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to of the MDQ at the contract rate demand commodity So there is a rate in

Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues I wouldnt want to do a discount because of full rate

Vernon Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Dornan Dari Cc Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Importance High Here are my suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate Then it would not look like a discount However there is no way to attach a comment to an exception Considerations The Transactional report will not pick up a postdated discount but this isnt really a discount The discount but not the exception would show up on the report but nobody reads that anyway When they nominated as max rate overrun it got scheduled Since they had a right to firm service they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly so they didnt really get an unfair advantage over other TI Steve Dari what do you think Original Message From Mercaldo Vernon Sent Thursday December AM To Blair Lynn Cc Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Bianchi Rita Subject OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Lynn Earlier this month I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated of their firm commodity as overrun I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldnt be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the th Thanks Vernon,blair-l,Director

Tariff Change Tariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Or der OFO on Northern Border which were part of Northern Borders approved Park and Loan PAL filing will become effective on November Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes Purpose of an OFO An OFO will be used by Northern Border to alleviate conditions that thre aten the integrity of the system maintain pipeline operations at pressu res required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service a ssure adequate system line pack and maintain service for all of Norther n Borders firm shippers An OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort Northern Border will firs t attempt to utilize its system its services transportation and PAL and if necessary assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operation al problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions Posting of an OFO Watch If resolution of an operational problem is unlikely such as when a daily o r cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a def ined tolerance range Northern Border will post an OFO watch Similar to a severe weather notice the purpose of an OFO watch is to prealert shipper s and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Borders sy stem in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance o f an OFO OFO Issuance Northern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action A Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible Furt hermore each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or an ticipated problem being addressed OFO Impact An OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services ando r the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirma tion process If service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO Northern Border will di rectly provide affected shippers as soon as possible a summary of the ser vice interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action In addition affected shippers will be notified of any imbal ances that require immediate resolution Routine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OF O is in effect Failure to Comply When an OFO is issued it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply If such shippers fail to respond to t he OFO or their response is insufficient to correct the problem Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of of the Historical Flow Quantity Northern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in c omplying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO Impact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects FERC Order No requires that pipelines take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders OFOs Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imb alances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid Consequently the November tariff changes includes language which define what is an accept able tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance To serve as a benchmark Northern Border has already begun calculating a Hi storical Flow Quantity HFQ for each point of interconnection on Northern Borders system The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quan tity for the previous consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quan tity for such time period On November the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a g iven interconnect on Northern Borders system will be of the point s HFQ If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected part y Northern Borders tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agr eed to both OBA parties Furthermore the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely the default da ily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be of the daily scheduled qua ntity Once again Northern Borders tariff does permit deviation from thi s standardized daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually accep table to the OBA parties For those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbala nce tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults de scribed above please contact Scott Coburn at ,blair-l,Director

Hicken Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Subject RE Zone Allocations To help clarify a storage withdrawal reduction essentially created the same physical effect as would an injection during the recent storage allocations For example If the storage fields had a net injection on a given day of dthphysical maximumand at the am cycle an injection increased by dth it would be denied because of the physical limitations The same limitation would occur if a withdraw was reduced by dth creating a net dth injection at the am process because the same physical limitation existing Injections Withdrawals Net physical limitation Trying to reduce a redraw of dth would create Injections Withdrawals Net physically above the limitation and would be allocated The intraday process are interative that is FDD withdrawalsinjections can impact the interruptible storage availability during the intraday cycles whereas the am process is only a individual trueup and not interative with the other storage agreements Lynn and Chris would gladly schedule some time to help clarify these issues and I am sure it will be a lot more informative than my attempt here Original Message From Jeff Hicken mailto Sent Friday November AM To Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Semin Frank Subject RE Zone Allocations It may be standard practice in your opinion but Kelly Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us Also EntergyKoch was completely surprised by it as well We just cant understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection Wed like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better We pulled looked at the am process instructions on the web and it doesnt say anything about this What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldnt do what we thought we had a right to do even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination On top of that no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the gas day if we hadnt been lucky enough to have found it on our own We pushed the gas across to ANR but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated but you cant do it at am It just doesnt make any sense to us Sebesta Chris AM Jeff I am sorry WPL and IES are experiencing allocation problems It is standard procedure during a storage injection allocation the am true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage injections Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their business Other than getting truer information on your markets needs or finding alternate markets for your excess capacity I dont have any other ideas on how to address your zone allocations As requested I will add this item to our December meeting agenda Original Message From Jeff Hicken mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Subject Re Zone Allocations Chris You should know that we are unhappy about something else now For the gas day you NNG did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal nomination to zero in the am process like normal because of a storage injection allocation Because of this WPL is going to get hit with SUL DDVC penalties EntergyKoch who handles the IES assests was surprised by this as well and IES may incur penalties too We werent trying to make an injection we were just trying to cut our withdrawal to zero We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we have been seeing lately Weve had conference call with Jean Blair and Jerry Wilkens on the topic We are also in trouble now for the gas day which we are current trying to figure a way out of You can add this item to our discussion topics when you visit Jeff Jeff Hicken Gas Trader AlliantEnergy Sebesta Chris AM Lynn as indicated in my voice mail Frank and I would like you to call Jeff Hicken of Alliant Energy He would like someone to explain why he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying to
