you intend to stay online and continue using Email The last few months have revealed an alarming trend in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push through legislation that will affect our use of the Internet Under proposed legislation the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill Email users out of alternative postage fees Bill P will permit the Federal Government to charge a cent surcharge on every email delivered by billing Internet Service Providers at source The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this legislation from becoming law The US Postal Service is claiming lost revenue due to the proliferation of Email is costing nearly in revenue per year You may have noticed their recent ad campaign There is nothing like a letter Since the average person received about pieces of Email per day in the cost of the typical individual would be an additional cents a day or over per year above and beyond their regular Internet costs Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a service they do not even provide The whole point of the Internet is democracy and noninterference You are already paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic inefficiency It currently takes up to days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast If the US Postal Service is allowed to tinker with Email it will mark the end of the free Internet in the United States Congressional representative Tony Schnell R has even suggested a per month

themselves and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability to extract from the mkt anything better than cif for delivery December period Indeed due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at on a cif basis Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts there is no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices Many were already well sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets Certain South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on track stating that it wont be until May next year that they are fully back on track again While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets Q still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied Still could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q at fob and JanDec at watch this space SPOT TRADES While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various channels it has been a week without any spot business As per above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements rather than pay these high prices in advance We are also not too aggressive at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot buyers are eventually forced to the table SELLING SIDE Mission still have not covered their December requirements Our offer of GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and GBP FOR Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material We said that he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell that wud be very kind The sage continues We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke Bremen for between mmt mil tonnes per year starting Jan Prices will be linked to the BAW Index HEWVW combined are tendering for mt for Q shipment into Hamburg We have offered cif Electrabel looking for mmt each month EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q Veag mmt cif Rostock for NovJun Endesa capes for H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working various possibilities of swapping material for While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward Fenosa mmt of Low Vol US material for but so far unable to get an offer basis this material Innogy looking for upto mil tonnes for delivery throughout Bewag still have tender out for mmt for next year where we are looking to put a proposal to them basis Polish material BUYING SIDE Continue to work Emerald for material out of the US hopefully persistence will pay and we may close something this week for shipments Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q shipment FOB Santa Marta at basis btulb Ensham had a lower quality coal cape quantity on offer at fob Oz but unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect to find a home for Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q which would equate to somewhere in the region cif ara Would be good to test viability of shipping thru this port In tandem with year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen obligations NCSC looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African material for EOL What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week yet Between Thursday and Friday we did trades via EOL equating to just over mt Glencore was the main sponsor of the action on Friday intent on driving prices higher they were a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments with no coal assets as a backstop Life to date we have traded mt on EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the mil mark this week We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at Coaltrans in two weeks time GAMEPLAN Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing tonnage to play with for next year To date our Drummond long has been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply out of Puerto Drummond for the first months of next year With the demand that we have on the table today we could turn our mill long into a short with no problem at all While there will always be a level where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so at the traded levels for today despite the absolute levels being the upper end of the historic range We still have a little way to go to actually signing contracts which secures us the year deal with stadtwerke Bremen but on the assumption we do we must start looking at our supply strategy for the first months of next year where it looks to be most challenging The business we will be fantastic for creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we can supply of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace Best Regards Jez,shankman-j,President

McDonaldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General

IMMEDIATE REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do It is difficult to predict the future and this seems

REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM

Mahoney AM To Mike CT Jeffrey A CT John L CT Greg CT cc Subject how to go forward in the oil markets CUSTOMER BUSINESS EOL Jeff I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the group are good starting points I dont feel this will increase revenues for us in as our efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort Both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on Please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates I plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that Im assembling in London By end October the London office will have managers associates and analyst in our group This is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside about success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron I think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in London and Im putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every European country Please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business Cant help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future Having seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume This is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system The challenge is how can we put up more volumes more markets and tighter ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to have I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct nd with Koch Dynergy Entergy Willams and a few others Are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have This is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform I dont feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers We are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different etrading sites BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS This has always received lukewarm interest from Enron I believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on that alone So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical business Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest financial commitment Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor We can candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets We have a credit department that have done a poor job if any at all in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with petrobras pertamina petrolimex sinochem sinopec egpc nnpc if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes We are also the worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform Our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many endusers who will insist on a greater performance guarantee As we discussed briefly in Singapore I think there are several airlines that we could target in the US for physical supply I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders Previously I have not gone after this business because I didnt believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters Please consider this I will fax you a tender offer from Japan Airlines and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars That kind of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forwardthis message was more to highlight how Im trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment Lastly on that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business At the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based system and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT people instead of traders I will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT department,shankman-j,President

Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market namely the Drummond Force Majeure What remains now is cif mkt which is in backwardisation for Q and Q versus the rest of but where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around million mt for the end of September Indeed utilities and traders alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and play the cash carry game This has certainly paid dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted productionshipments from various geographies While the whole curve has shifted north as a result of early buying interest for the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q and Q prices increase by some over past weeks to absolute values at cif ARA this represents a prm of between over JanDec run Believe the front end will continue to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates increase in prodn synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices from the high levels they are today Control of FOB origin prices through continued consolidation in the production side of the industry could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible SPOT TRADES Bot

tonnage traded via EOL with the activity that went on this week There continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we really need to focus on converting the increasing number of guest user IDs we are giving out into actual transactions on the system many are still afraid of the technology many are still ignorant of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply dont have the authority hence we continue to focus on preaching the word to all and sundry Highlight this week was having Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were propping the mkt up on the buy side We are moving ahead with posting options on the SECA contract on EOL GAMEPLAN Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for and with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for from the high levels today RBCT ARA Cape combined with a somewhat weaker tone in continental power prices for we are fairly keen to hit some of this business at current price levels We have benefited from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from other geographies such as South Africa Australia US and Russia that will allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book Have extended dlist this

can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPCs terminal As you know DPC is owned today by Enron MSEB GE and Bechtel At year end Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses

Jeffrey A ShankmanHOUECT on PM Robert Johnston PM To Jeff CT cc Paul CT SeungTaek NRON Brenda n nron Gary CT Darren nron Kimberly nron Scott nron Jeffrey A CT Subject Asian Credit Watch AP P Per our conversations with most of you this week Brendan and I have developed the following information on Asian Pulp Paper and its potential to trigger widescale credit problems in Asia In the past week APP has co me close to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond issues Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the Asian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market debt This week the Indonesian government further complicated the picture by attaching assets of the Sinar Mas group including APP to guarantees of Sinar Mas groups billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia BII Indonesias fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group The Wijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute before seeking a workout and corporate restructuring RJ The Immediate Problem o billion in bonds are due in on top of billion owed to the Indonesian government through the Sinar Mas group o Between now and April the APP group must come up with million fo r nine separate coupon payments coming due APP itself will owe million i n interest payments on four bonds over the next month o APP missed a February deadline for two bond payments of million on e payment has been made but the other of million is still hanging Risks are formidable with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon d holders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring o Assets are encumbered by complex crossguarantees that make it difficult to impossible to separate out individual properties o The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a delisting unless APP stock rises above the US level delisting will trigger immediate redemption clauses in some classes of bonds o The companys Indonesian assets are diseased Despite APPs apparen tly sound business model it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi n the Indonesian forestry and forest products industry o Inventory dumping by APP particularly in China has been a major factor depressing paper prices since mid o APPs management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei r cash shortages It has not reported third quarter earnings for due la st November to the US Securities and Exchange Commission although as a foreign company it has six months to report earnings versus one month for US companies Intercompany transfers may be masking serious problems within the APP group o Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened impeachment of Indonesias President Wahid lowering prospects for a government bailout of APPs parent company the Sinar Mas group and its owners the Wijaya family o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets with SP already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity APP Risk Profile APPs only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset sales or a selloff of pulp and paper inventory Neither has much chance of success APPs current strategy is to muscle its bondholders into a restructuring agreement as soon as possible most likely before an early March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due There are significant obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring from crossguarantees of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various jurisdictions to intercompany transfers that present a false picture of financial health in some of its operating companies Such obstacles ensure that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy APP is the fifth largest issuer of junk bonds in the world and has been regarded as a benchmark bon d for Indonesia Until the last few months it was the only bond in the world that traded at a premium to its own governments bonds and was the only Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the depth of the Asian crisis A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian bonds in the event of a default as investors wait to see what happens to unsecured creditors who account for percent to percent of APPs US billion in debt At the moment systemic fallout seems likely to be limited to the Asian region as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri ng the Asian financial crisis APP Key Decision Makers The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda Wijaya No others in the company are privy to all the Groups Affairs o r to corporate strategy Information is extremely closely held Sources say that the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o f the assets of APP or its subsidiaries so complex are the cross guarantees and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game engaging i n brinkmanship with their bond holders It signaled the market that it could move into a default situation on February when its paper making subsidiar y Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah failed to make payments on two different bond issues worth million On February APP finally paid the coupon on one of the bonds a US million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius just within a grace period of five business days If Tjiwi Kimia had failed to meet the deadline it would have triggered cross default clauses on a series of other bonds The second coupon payment of million for a US million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in is now late W e expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment The group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring The better its cash position is the more APP will be able to operate from a position of strength in a restructuring negotiation According to one source APP is signaling the market and its bond holde rs that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before everything collapse The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now while they still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin g left APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies some of which have significant cash flow is different from those in the parent Th is is obviously a dangerous game but one in which APP feels it has no choice but to engage The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be and the greater its chances of survival in some form Trying to keep control of the situation so that it doesnt unravel is the name of the game at this point Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their noncore subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring They have been actively shopping their China assets for several months and sources indica te that their packaging assets will also go on the block APP is still hopeful however of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group and often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas Another source said This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if you start messing with the structure lets say one group of bond holders wa nts to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer you could threaten the whole group The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors and are not in the category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan who was sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and corruption They are not saints the Indonesian government removed the Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was nationalized in based on evidence that they exceeded the percent c ap for lending to affiliates However they depend heavily on international capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would bar future access At the moment they have few alternatives to raise cash to meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales The company has built up substantial paper inventory and according to one source it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it could find a buyer This is a big if however since current prices are depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make matters worse Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th at APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets These assets include o PT Ekamas Fortuna o PT Purinusa Ekapersada o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper o Gold Hongye Paper o Gold Hai Paper Kunshan Co o Jin Yu Qingyuan Tissue Paper Industry The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the assets on offer but had held back because of the impenetrable cross guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity The executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would finance an acquisition Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin a factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intracompany prices Once the company is broken up into pieces it will have to rely on the worl d market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected It is said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be considerably less One of the problems with APPs brinkmanship strategy is that it is lowering the value of its assets Companies will not be willing to pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its noncore assets Restructuring is imminent creating opportunities for investors o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric es and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia o A restructuring will release some of APPs assets which are considere d attractive except for those in Indonesia APP is the worlds low cost producer of pulp and paper with substantial assets in Indonesia China an d India Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current overcapacity i n the domestic Chinese market APP accounts for percent of the Chinese market for printing and fine paper o Some play is available from price volatility as APP continues to tease investors by keeping them guessing about its actual cash situation,shankman-j,President

PM To Michelle D CT cc Gary CT James D nron Richard nron Jaime nron John CT Jeff CT Kristin CT Scott nron Subject California Power As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on for the California electricity crisis state officials around Governor Gray Davis have toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be paid by the State of California One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity As we reported last week Davis and his aides want to pay around to dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to determine the price but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over longterm contracts Our sources in Washington Sacramento and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish longterm power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term This weeks legislative activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for superpriority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy Audit Untangling Utility Relationships California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the to billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the powergenerating and powerdistributing companies under a holding company umbrella Of course that means that some of the power PGE and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the risky debt premium that PGE and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial day deadline In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension Debt Restructuring Guarantees but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a day forbearance period whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now Davis idea as he laid it out in the meeting is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities forward rate base or by establishing a mediumterm repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can pay down this debt There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations but he remains opposed to using direct state money This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility Eminent DomainReregulation Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political advisers have with nonmarket solutions to the energy crisis Although the Governors aides actually believe the weapon is more a way to force eventual agreement than an actual solution the talk returns frequently to these nonmarket mechanisms We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the Tuesday deadline If we make no progress If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will retake the plants and equipment and run them ourselves a close political aide to Davis said We will absorb the plants the transmission lines and the reserved parking places of the executives The legislature would agree in a second,shankman-j,President

Doug LeachHOUECT on AM webmaster on PM To cc Subject CERA Monthly Oil Briefing CERA Alert December TITLE CERA Monthly Oil Briefing Fundamentals Update Email Category CERA Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States In November stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels At this level they are below the highs of but well above the low levels of early see Figure Japanese crude oil inventories at endOctober were million barrels

Differentials The fall in product prices that started in late Octoberafter a brief surge during heightened market tensions over Middle East unrestcontinued in November Average differentials for all products over crude fell with those for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported demand FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent averaged per barrel compared with per barrel in October Jetkerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over per barrel in November from Octobers average but because of current market sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil they remained high at an average of per barrel Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of all products during Octobers Middle Eastrelated price increases consequently jetkerosenes premium over heating oil narrowed in November following an easing of tensions averaging the month at per barrel compared with per barrel over heating oil in October Despite falling by per barrel from Octobers level average sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November averaging per barrel over Dated Brent High enduser prices for heating oil remain a strong deterrent to demand however provisional data for German heating oil demand in November show a fall of over percent from November levels to an average of barrels per day bd Discounts of low sulfur heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again in November averaging per barrel As was discussed last month much of the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the availability in Russian exports toward the end of October and into November however such concerns subsided leading to a widening of discounts High sulfur fuel oil discounts widened by per barrel to an average of per barrel to Dated Brent Refinery Margins Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in October but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production especially of middle distillates High jetkerosene and gasoilheating oil values kept margins buoyant but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts were the major downward influences Using CERAs illustrative yield patterns gross margins for simplehydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by per barrel over Dated Brent from Octobers level averaging per barrel in November The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of the decline with the large drop in gasoline values contributing per barrel to the fall The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA complexcracking refineries Using CERAs illustrative yield patterns gross margins averaged per barrel in November this is per barrel lower than Octobers average of which is attributable to the poorer gasoline premiums with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values European Inventories and Refinery Operations EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further bd in November averaging million barrels per day mbd again an indication of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins Output data for individual products are not yet available but the high crude runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another month of very high jetkerosene and gasoil production Despite the strong crude runs primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories did increase in November ending the month million barrels higher than Octobers level which was revised downward at million barrels There has been a small but consistent threemonth contango in the Brent futures market placing a small premium on forward months values of crude to the current months which would help to encourage stockholding These stocks represent about days forward supply of anticipated total demand in the first quarter of next yearless than days fewer supply compared with November levels for the past two years Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from million barrels to million barrels contrary to typical seasonal patterns This may reflect the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging high gasoline production levels Nevertheless this is a potential cause for concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first quarter of next year Primary middle distillate inventories however are continuing to improve Octobers total was revised upward slightly to million barrels and November ended at million barrels In addition to record levels of refinery production exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful with Novembers total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging bd A strong transatlantic arbitrage however has been causing most of these cargoes to go direct to the

during November Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of at exceptionally high values CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year per barrel lower than this years first quarter average High sulfur No fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly averaging per barrel in November Despite the drop of per barrel from Octobers average fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values per barrel higher than a year ago and per barrel greater that the previous fiveyear average For the first quarter of CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of per barrel in the first quarter Jetkerosene differentials versus WTI rose per barrel from the October average reaching a whopping per barrel in November In correspondence with the distillate market jetkerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals CERA expects jetkerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of per barrel Margins for US Gulf Coast sulfur residual fuel dropped by per barrel reaching per barrel below WTI during November Despite the recent widening of differentials CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months Residual fuel differentials are expected to average per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range US Demand Highlights Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about million barrels per day mbd from the October level reaching mbd for the four weeks ending December Demand is averaging less than percent below last year largely because YK concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending December over percent greater than this time last year This represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endOctober level of mb but still a record high level for early December With support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the Northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within

ShankmanHOUECT on PM Ben Macklowe on PM To cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision Original Message From Elizabeth Prickett Morgan To Sent Thursday December PM Subject Analysis of Supreme Court decision A friend sent me the following QA it sums up the legal issues very clearly Q Im not a lawyer and I dont understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore Can you explain it to me A Sure Im a lawyer I read it It says Bush wins even if Gore got the most votes Q But wait a second The US Supreme Court has to give a reason right A Right Q So Bush wins because handcounts are illegal A Oh no Six of the justices twothirds majority believed the handcounts were legal and should be done Q Oh So the justices did not believe that the handcounts would find any legal ballots A Nope The five conservative justices clearly held and all nine justices agreed that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean complete way by the voter So there are legal votes that should be counted but cant be Q Oh Does this have something to do with states rights Dont conservatives love that A Generally yes These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it cant steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women Q Is there an exception in this case A Yes the Gore exception States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President This decision is limited to only this situation Q Cmon The Supremes didnt really say that Youre exaggerating A Nope They held Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities Q What complexities A They dont say Q Ill bet I know the reason I heard Jim Baker say this The votes cant be counted because the Florida Supreme Court changed the rules of the election after it was held Right A Dead wrong The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong Q Huh A The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is clear intent of the voter The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislatures law after the election A Right Q So whats the problem A They should have The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have adopted adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote Q I thought only the Legislature could adopt new law A Right Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned A Right Youre catching on Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules And if it didnt its overturned for not changing the rules That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did legal votes could never be counted A Right Next question Q Wait wait I thought the problem was equal protection that some counties counted votes differently from others Isnt that a problem A It sure is Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems Some like the opticalscanners in largely Republicanleaning counties record of the votes Some like the punchcard systems in largely Democraticleaning counties record only of the votes So approximately of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can Q Aha Thats a severe equalprotection problem A No its not The Supreme Court wasnt worried about the of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida That complexity was not a problem Q Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan A Nope The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler Q Yikes So what was the serious equal protection problem A The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the of Democrats largely AfricanAmerican disenfranchised The problem is that somewhat less than of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of clear intent of the voter may have a slightly opinion about the voters intent Q Hmmm OK so if those votes are thrown out you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voters intent is clear A Nope Q Why not A No time Q No time to count legal votes where everyone even Republicans agree the intent is clear Why not A Because December was yesterday Q Is December a deadline for counting votes A No January is the deadline In Hawaiis votes werent counted until January Q So why is December important A December is a deadline by which Congress cant challenge the results Q What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court A Nothing Q But I thought A The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December to make things easier for Congress The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding Q But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday Q Why A Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal Q So why not separate the votes into piles indentations for Gore hanging chads for Bush votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won Then if some ballots say indentations have to be thrown out the American people will know right away who won Florida A Great idea The US Supreme Court rejected it They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gores winning would cause public acceptance and that would cast a cloud over Bushs legitimacy that would harm democratic stability Q In other words if America knows the truth that Gore won they wont accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gores victory A Yes Q Is that a legal reason to stop recounts or a political one A Lets just say in all of American history and all of American law this reason has no basis in law But that doesnt stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air Q Arent these conservative justices against judicial activism A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it Q Well if the December deadline is not binding why not count the votes A The US Supreme Court after admitting the December deadline is not binding set December as a binding deadline at pm on December Q Didnt the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline A Yes Q But but A Not to worry The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts Q So who caused Florida to miss the December deadline A The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount the rentamob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount Q So who is punished for this behavior A Gore of course Q Tell me this Floridas laws are unconstitutional A Yes Q And the laws of states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional A Yes And states have the clear intent of the voter standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida Q Then why arent the results of states thrown out A Um Becauseumthe Supreme Court doesnt say Q But if Floridas certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional we dont know who really won the election there right A Right Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about votes excluding the butterfly ballot errors Q So what do we do have a revote throw out the entire state count under a single uniform standard A No We just dont count the votes that favor Gore Q Thats completely bizarre That sounds like rank political favoritism Did the justices have any financial interest in the case A Scalias two sons are both lawyers working for Bush Thomass wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration Q Why didnt they recuse themselves A If either had recused himself the vote would be and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed Q I cant believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way A Read the opinions for yourself supremecourtdecpdf December stay stopping the recount opinionspdfpdf December opinion Q So what are the consequences of this A The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution Al Gore will lose to Americas second choice who won the all important Supreme Court vote Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins A True in a democracy But America is not a democracy In America in the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins Q So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President A He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected Soon lawless justices may constitute or even on the court Q Is there any way to stop this A YES No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate It takes votes to break a filibuster If only of the Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in the judicial reign of terror can endand one day we can hope to return to the rule of law Q What do I do now A Email this to everyone you know and write or call your senator reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes three times Kennedys margin over Nixon and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until when a president is finally chosen by most of the American people Mark H Levine Attorney at Law,shankman-j,President

ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Hey guys no real need to read all of this I just want to be sure your team and our team are closely coordinating on the Elba Island tolling agreements your team and gas sales agreements our team These discussions have been going on for about eight months now and I want to be sure this is all worthwhile Phil Demoes is spending a considerable amount of time coordinating and negotiating with Southern Co and other sales customers for the LNG offtake agreements Im assuming Doug Arnell is your lead on deciding and executing on the strategy at Elba There is a CONSIDERABLE amount of money to be made depending on your view of the longterm supply curve for LNG Question Are the right people involved here on both sides to develop and execute on the strategy at Elba What is our specific strategy at Elba and can we accelerate our negotiations on the various contracts here Please advise Thanks Forwarded by Janet R DietrichHOUECT on AM Phil NRON AM To Janet R CT Gil NRON Ed CT cc Dan J CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Janet Gil and Ed Please note Les latest summary of Elba Things seem to be coming to a head there Southern Co was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from the terminal We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by Les I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this So Cos latest offer was Hub for all dtd So Co wants dtd at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining dtd at Elba or Destin at our option We have not discussed what a price at Destin should be So Co has some leverage with El Paso that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below Additionally they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at Elba We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday Let me know if you have any questions Forwarded by Phil DeMoesCorpEnron on AM Les Webber ENRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Doug ArnellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Nancy CorbetENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Shelley NRON Phil NRON David L CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL GREETINGS On November Southern LNG advised the FERC that it has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island With this withdrawal the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the day period allowed by FERC procedures This gives us until December to file which presumably would be extended until Monday December Our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on November Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard At the same time this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions On Wednesday November we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a headsup regarding our likely response to Southern LNGs proposed letter agreement dated November We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the Stabilization Project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday November after we received a copy of Southern LNGs letter to the FERC he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor Mr Varagona will be in Houston on November and and he wants to meet with us He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to El Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx per MMBtu Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost He said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which I responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and for El Paso to respond with I dont think that will work Mr Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies It just wont work As a consequence he stated that Clarke Smith head of El Paso Merchant Energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter Apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years He also alluded to the possibility that Mr Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton for less than obvious reasons to me Mr Varagona further advised me that a DukeWilliams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal divestment of this asset was required I understand as part of the El PasoCoastal merger This situation gives added impetus to development of the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal However we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear However should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage Southern LNG in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with El Paso In the case of Southern LNG we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with Enron I would recommend any compromise with El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us and checking it twice I would appreciate receiving your comments if any before Thanksgiving Regards Les Webber,shankman-j,President

has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly behind per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was heading swiftly to While there had been some nervous short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and in general have refused to commit to these numbers The lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of course mkt psychology with it While producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to Several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be an additional million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for destination Europe most likely On the flip side Kepco will be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking for some million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over last three weeks with business being booked out of the US Indonesia and Australia at numbers close to what was achievable from SA into Europe This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to do business with other suppliers namely ourselves in order to avoid being captive to one supplier Weglekoks incidentally are currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales made against Polish to Bewag we dont want to be short Polish in the near term Mkt now trading at Fob barge ARA for JanDec and level for the JanMar We still see couple dollars on the downside although the latest incident guerrilla attack on rail line last week has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production down in Colombia by half for first few months of to make a point to the unions We are still trying to ascertain how much this wud bull the mkt shortterm but we wud certainly take the opportunity to sell any spike SPOT TRADES January pnmx FOB Santa Marta from Masefield at pmt basis btu One Cape of Colombian to Scotts

significant tonnage of Russian coal for forward Various projects within South Africa all of which emanate from the development and success of Operation Springbok EOL Update Total EOL trades for November stand at million mt out of a running total of million from its inception As the figures suggest there is increasing activityliquidity in the market with the arrival of several new players in recent weeks most notably AEP Increased volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECAs traded in the OTC market with more and more utilities who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party RWE has been the latest SECA virgin to lose its cherry closing a deal with ourselves early last week on Q through TFS We are now offering our products in Euros aswell the good old green back much to the confusion of one or two of our clients At current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the mill mark by the end of the year GAMEPLAN We are currently long to the tune of mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some mill mt weighted pretty evenly across Q Q and Q backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both Richards Bay and Drummond We are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term Cal business while running a European short posn which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt Shud the the European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the money options which we wud utilise to execute any physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped

Jeffrey A CT George CT cc Subject The Way Forward Now I know why God made lawyers Below is Kevin Liss latest analysis His main thesis is that there is a huge return available to the company that will take the tax risk We just have to find that company Dan Forwarded by Daniel ReckHOUECT on PM Kevin NRON PM To Daniel CT Tim CT cc Stephen H CT Subject The Way Forward Dan in response to your question yesterday it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank DB had contemplated In that respect last weeks IRS announcement leaves things unchanged Thats the good news However in light of last weeks IRS announcement DB is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming Pacificorps existing letter rulings which they have told us was critical to them It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a nonstarter from their perspective at least based upon the present plan of operations Tim is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their runofmine coal consistently with their existing rulings I doubt it but if not we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with Pacificorp I believe that Pacificorp still needs to unload their facilities and they may still be able to leverage off of their existing rulings which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS Without a deal with DB what are our options now First it is important to recognize that we still have options The IRS has not killed synfuel There has not been any change in the substantive law Last weeks announcement was just that an announcement of the IRSs point of view The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business which has been an important source of comfort to many investors but not necessarily vital Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having a private letter ruling from the IRS generally in reliance on an opinion of outside counsel We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorps facilties meaning we would relocate them and continue running runofmine coal the IRS be damned and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than Pacificorp In short we would need companies who are willing to rely on Pacificorps existing rulings period along with an appropriate indemnity It seems to me that if the price is right someone ought to be willing to step up While the risk is now greater the potential returns are potentially mindblowing and an equity player ought to be able to get an opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits notwithstanding the IRS current view of the law It seems to me that this is the only approach that makes sense Alternatively Pacificorps facilities could revert back to being a pure coal fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRSs recent announcement The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that process waste coal fines so such facilities could still qualify for new private letter rulings The IRS announcement defines the term waste coal fines very vaguely not specifying either the coal size or what it is that makes coal fines properly viewed as waste coal fines If you think in lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their announcement I can envision that Enron could synthetically create waste coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility customers to provide for the sale of only coal of inches or greater resulting in a residual category of unwanted coal that we could separately market to synfuel plants as waste coal fines In other words they could be fairly described as waste insofar as another coal customer specifically excluded it from their contract In addition the IRS announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output as some commontators had feared which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity However there are real difficulties with this approach First the relevant language in the IRS announcement defining waste coal fines is not real statutory law It is basically just an IRS policy statement meaning that we cannot bind the IRS to it So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the IRSs choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were statutory law Also Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste fines is fines from true waste ponds Even if the taxpayer can argue over the meaning of the term waste fines the IRS can stick to their understanding of the term at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue a new ruling In short the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly or waste fines incidental to mining operations If you are not going to be able to get a new ruling anyway whats the point of going back to being a coal fine processing facility But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines generally ie not merely waste coal fines as well as runofmine coal Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more restrictive than the ones that they already have That is truly putting value at risk In my view the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing rulings as essentially above market rulings insofar as they go farther than the IRS currently allows giving them a competitive advantage over other synfuel operators who never got a ruling It seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal Kevin Liss x,shankman-j,President

Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q and Q Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versus the rest of the year versus RBCTARA and with the US mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end east coast trading fob barge there is little sign of relief in the short term Q Fob ARA is now trading close to with JanDec around Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango for the remainder of the year however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this if anything demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango This said we cannot preclude a shift higher of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around Fob South Africa equivalent to there is still plenty of business to be done for and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and see game we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated its implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology SPOT TRADES mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt of Prima quality from KPC for Nov shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt option of Prima quality from KPC to be shipped latest end June at Fob Indo basis kcalkg x mt Put Options from TXU for AprilSep and OctMar respectively Strike price is basis Amsterdam Rotterdam and expiry is Feb and Aug Premium cents SELLING SIDE British Energy pitching a and year deal to them as an extension to current contract we have with them which runs out end March Scotts Power looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to FOR deal and sell incremental cape for March arrival H Del C offering them a year put option basis the SECA Endessa we have offered them plus cape business for based on Fob South Africa NCSC looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising EOL in the next week to hedge some of their implied short position Heidelberger offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for November delivery at Bremen shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen supplying them some mt of generic quality coal on an annual basis Bewag currently working an offer to supply million mt for on delivered stockpile basis ENBWNeckarverkePreag offering Oz material for NovDec just shy of fob ARA Braunschweig offered them x mt for MarJunJly delivery into Nordenham at cif Dyckerhoff offered x mt of generic South Africa material for AprilNovember delivery at fob barge BUYING SIDE Duiker Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for they are due to get back to us within the next few days Drummond offered us a year deal staring in at Fob Colombia thanks Krutrade working numbers to put an aggressive multiyear offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian mkt at present we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business going forward Anker talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for they are looking at somewhere around the fob Maputo level Masefield currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for Coal Procurement talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for Currently working with US on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for but currently remain apart We currently have some mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in AmsterdanRotterdam to sell as fillers into backend of the year and we have the MV Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov with mmt of Australian coal to sell into the mkt EOL Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an eplatform which will provide mkts against Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point Details of operational functionality are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckons it will be operational end of first quarter Rather than see this as competition if successful it could provide us with more access to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers Total volumes for EOL to date are at mt We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options As volatility increases other nontraditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents Next project is to get quotes in Euros and after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL GAMEPLAN We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between and Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South African material to add to our Colombian long Overall our position is some million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers it is difficult to call this mkt in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options Best Regards

Heat CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Mon October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is

experienced during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and play the cash carry game This has certainly paid dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted productionshipments from various geographies While the whole curve has shifted north as a result of early buying interest for the

consolidation in the production side of the industry could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible SPOT TRADES Bot

tonnage traded via EOL with the activity that went on this week There continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we really need to focus on converting the increasing number of guest user IDs we are giving out into actual transactions on the system many are still afraid of the technology many are still ignorant of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply dont have the authority hence we continue to focus on preaching the word to all and sundry Highlight this week was having Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were propping the mkt up on the buy side We are moving ahead with posting options on the SECA contract on EOL GAMEPLAN Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for and with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for from the high levels today RBCT ARA Cape combined with a somewhat weaker tone in continental power prices for we are fairly keen to hit some of this business at current price levels We have benefited from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from other geographies such as South Africa Australia US and Russia that will allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book Have extended dlist this

Candace CT Harry PapadopoulosENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Katrina CT Jez CT Kevin NRON Tom CT Scott nron Dan NRON cc Paul CT Karolina CT Meindert CT Louis CT Niamh CT Gregor CT Florian CT Subject ARA Coal Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q and Q Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versus the rest of the year versus RBCTARA and with the US mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end east coast trading fob barge there is little sign of relief in the short term Q Fob ARA is now trading close to with JanDec around Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango for the remainder of the year however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this if anything demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango This said we cannot preclude a shift higher of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around Fob South Africa equivalent to there is still plenty of business to be done for and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and see game we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated its implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology SPOT TRADES mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt of Prima quality from KPC for Nov shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt option of Prima quality from KPC to be shipped latest end June at Fob Indo basis kcalkg x mt Put Options from TXU for AprilSep and OctMar respectively Strike price is basis Amsterdam Rotterdam and expiry is Feb and Aug Premium cents SELLING SIDE British Energy pitching a and year deal to them as an extension to current contract we have with them which runs out end March Scotts Power looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to FOR deal and sell incremental cape for March arrival H Del C offering them a year put option basis the SECA Endessa we have offered them plus cape business for based on Fob South Africa NCSC looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising EOL in the next week to hedge some of their implied short position Heidelberger offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for November delivery at Bremen shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen supplying them some mt of generic quality coal on an annual basis Bewag currently working an offer to supply million mt for on delivered stockpile basis ENBWNeckarverkePreag offering Oz material for NovDec just shy of fob ARA Braunschweig offered them x mt for MarJunJly delivery into Nordenham at cif Dyckerhoff offered x mt of generic South Africa material for AprilNovember delivery at fob barge BUYING SIDE Duiker Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for they are due to get back to us within the next few days Drummond offered us a year deal staring in at Fob Colombia thanks Krutrade working numbers to put an aggressive multiyear offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian mkt at present we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business going forward Anker talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for they are looking at somewhere around the fob Maputo level Masefield currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for Coal Procurement talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for Currently working with US on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for but currently remain apart We currently have some mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in AmsterdanRotterdam to sell as fillers into backend of the year and we have the MV Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov with mmt of Australian coal to sell into the mkt EOL Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an eplatform which will provide mkts against Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point Details of operational functionality are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckons it will be operational end of first quarter Rather than see this as competition if successful it could provide us with more access to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers Total volumes for EOL to date are at mt We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options As volatility increases other nontraditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents Next project is to get quotes in Euros and after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL GAMEPLAN We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between and Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South African material to add to our Colombian long Overall our position is some million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers it is difficult to call this mkt in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options Best Regards

Jeffrey A CT George CT cc Subject The Way Forward Now I know why God made lawyers Below is Kevin Liss latest analysis His main thesis is that there is a huge return available to the company that will take the tax risk We just have to find that company Dan Forwarded by Daniel ReckHOUECT on PM Kevin NRON PM To Daniel CT Tim CT cc Stephen H CT Subject The Way Forward Dan in response to your question yesterday it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank DB had contemplated In that respect last weeks IRS announcement leaves things unchanged Thats the good news However in light of last weeks IRS announcement DB is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming Pacificorps existing letter rulings which they have told us was critical to them It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a nonstarter from their perspective at least based upon the present plan of operations Tim is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their runofmine coal consistently with their existing rulings I doubt it but if not we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with Pacificorp I believe that Pacificorp still needs to unload their facilities and they may still be able to leverage off of their existing rulings which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS Without a deal with DB what are our options now First it is important to recognize that we still have options The IRS has not killed synfuel There has not been any change in the substantive law Last weeks announcement was just that an announcement of the IRSs point of view The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business which has been an important source of comfort to many investors but not necessarily vital Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having a private letter ruling from the IRS generally in reliance on an opinion of outside counsel We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorps facilties meaning we would relocate them and continue running runofmine coal the IRS be damned and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than Pacificorp In short we would need companies who are willing to rely on Pacificorps existing rulings period along with an appropriate indemnity It seems to me that if the price is right someone ought to be willing to step up While the risk is now greater the potential returns are potentially mindblowing and an equity player ought to be able to get an opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits notwithstanding the IRS current view of the law It seems to me that this is the only approach that makes sense Alternatively Pacificorps facilities could revert back to being a pure coal fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRSs recent announcement The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that process waste coal fines so such facilities could still qualify for new private letter rulings The IRS announcement defines the term waste coal fines very vaguely not specifying either the coal size or what it is that makes coal fines properly viewed as waste coal fines If you think in lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their announcement I can envision that Enron could synthetically create waste coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility customers to provide for the sale of only coal of inches or greater resulting in a residual category of unwanted coal that we could separately market to synfuel plants as waste coal fines In other words they could be fairly described as waste insofar as another coal customer specifically excluded it from their contract In addition the IRS announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output as some commontators had feared which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity However there are real difficulties with this approach First the relevant language in the IRS announcement defining waste coal fines is not real statutory law It is basically just an IRS policy statement meaning that we cannot bind the IRS to it So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the IRSs choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were statutory law Also Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste fines is fines from true waste ponds Even if the taxpayer can argue over the meaning of the term waste fines the IRS can stick to their understanding of the term at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue a new ruling In short the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly or waste fines incidental to mining operations If you are not going to be able to get a new ruling anyway whats the point of going back to being a coal fine processing facility But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines generally ie not merely waste coal fines as well as runofmine coal Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more restrictive than the ones that they already have That is truly putting value at risk In my view the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing rulings as essentially above market rulings insofar as they go farther than the IRS currently allows giving them a competitive advantage over other synfuel operators who never got a ruling It seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal Kevin Liss x,shankman-j,President

Mahoney AM To Mike CT Jeffrey A CT John L CT Greg CT cc Subject how to go forward in the oil markets CUSTOMER BUSINESS EOL Jeff I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the group are good starting points I dont feel this will increase revenues for us in as our efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort Both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on Please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates I plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that Im assembling in London By end October the London office will have managers associates and analyst in our group This is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside about success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron I think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in London and Im putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every European country Please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business Cant help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future Having seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume This is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system The challenge is how can we put up more volumes more markets and tighter ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to have I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct nd with Koch Dynergy Entergy Willams and a few others Are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have This is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform I dont feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers We are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different etrading sites BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS This has always received lukewarm interest from Enron I believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on that alone So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical business Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest financial commitment Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor We can candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets We have a credit department that have done a poor job if any at all in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with petrobras pertamina petrolimex sinochem sinopec egpc nnpc if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes We are also the worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform Our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many endusers who will insist on a greater performance guarantee As we discussed briefly in Singapore I think there are several airlines that we could target in the US for physical supply I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders Previously I have not gone after this business because I didnt believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters Please consider this I will fax you a tender offer from Japan Airlines and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars That kind of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forwardthis message was more to highlight how Im trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment Lastly on that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business At the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based system and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT people instead of traders I will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT department,shankman-j,President

has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly behind per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was heading swiftly to While there had been some nervous short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and in general have refused to commit to these numbers The lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of course mkt psychology with it While producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to Several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be an additional million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for destination Europe most likely On the flip side Kepco will be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking for some million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over last three weeks with business being booked out of the US Indonesia and Australia at numbers close to what was achievable from SA into Europe This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to do business with other suppliers namely ourselves in order to avoid being captive to one supplier Weglekoks incidentally are currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales made against Polish to Bewag we dont want to be short Polish in the near term Mkt now trading at Fob barge ARA for JanDec and level for the JanMar We still see couple dollars on the downside although the latest incident guerrilla attack on rail line last week has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production down in Colombia by half for first few months of to make a point to the unions We are still trying to ascertain how much this wud bull the mkt shortterm but we wud certainly take the opportunity to sell any spike SPOT TRADES January pnmx FOB Santa Marta from Masefield at pmt basis btu One Cape of Colombian to Scotts

significant tonnage of Russian coal for forward Various projects within South Africa all of which emanate from the development and success of Operation Springbok EOL Update Total EOL trades for November stand at million mt out of a running total of million from its inception As the figures suggest there is increasing activityliquidity in the market with the arrival of several new players in recent weeks most notably AEP Increased volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECAs traded in the OTC market with more and more utilities who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party RWE has been the latest SECA virgin to lose its cherry closing a deal with ourselves early last week on Q through TFS We are now offering our products in Euros aswell the good old green back much to the confusion of one or two of our clients At current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the mill mark by the end of the year GAMEPLAN We are currently long to the tune of mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some mill mt weighted pretty evenly across Q Q and Q backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both Richards Bay and Drummond We are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term Cal business while running a European short posn which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt Shud the the European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the money options which we wud utilise to execute any physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped

REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General Counsel Enron

REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region I have not followed this closely but question why we would give a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive

Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General Counsel Enron APACHI,shankman-j,President

ShankmanHOUECT on PM Ben Macklowe on PM To cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision Original Message From Elizabeth Prickett Morgan To Sent Thursday December PM Subject Analysis of Supreme Court decision A friend sent me the following QA it sums up the legal issues very clearly Q Im not a lawyer and I dont understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore Can you explain it to me A Sure Im a lawyer I read it It says Bush wins even if Gore got the most votes Q But wait a second The US Supreme Court has to give a reason right A Right Q So Bush wins because handcounts are illegal A Oh no Six of the justices twothirds majority believed the handcounts were legal and should be done Q Oh So the justices did not believe that the handcounts would find any legal ballots A Nope The five conservative justices clearly held and all nine justices agreed that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean complete way by the voter So there are legal votes that should be counted but cant be Q Oh Does this have something to do with states rights Dont conservatives love that A Generally yes These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it cant steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women Q Is there an exception in this case A Yes the Gore exception States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President This decision is limited to only this situation Q Cmon The Supremes didnt really say that Youre exaggerating A Nope They held Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities Q What complexities A They dont say Q Ill bet I know the reason I heard Jim Baker say this The votes cant be counted because the Florida Supreme Court changed the rules of the election after it was held Right A Dead wrong The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong Q Huh A The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is clear intent of the voter The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislatures law after the election A Right Q So whats the problem A They should have The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have adopted adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote Q I thought only the Legislature could adopt new law A Right Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned A Right Youre catching on Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules And if it didnt its overturned for not changing the rules That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did legal votes could never be counted A Right Next question Q Wait wait I thought the problem was equal protection that some counties counted votes differently from others Isnt that a problem A It sure is Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems Some like the opticalscanners in largely Republicanleaning counties record of the votes Some like the punchcard systems in largely Democraticleaning counties record only of the votes So approximately of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can Q Aha Thats a severe equalprotection problem A No its not The Supreme Court wasnt worried about the of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida That complexity was not a problem Q Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan A Nope The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler Q Yikes So what was the serious equal protection problem A The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the of Democrats largely AfricanAmerican disenfranchised The problem is that somewhat less than of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of clear intent of the voter may have a slightly opinion about the voters intent Q Hmmm OK so if those votes are thrown out you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voters intent is clear A Nope Q Why not A No time Q No time to count legal votes where everyone even Republicans agree the intent is clear Why not A Because December was yesterday Q Is December a deadline for counting votes A No January is the deadline In Hawaiis votes werent counted until January Q So why is December important A December is a deadline by which Congress cant challenge the results Q What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court A Nothing Q But I thought A The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December to make things easier for Congress The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding Q But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday Q Why A Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal Q So why not separate the votes into piles indentations for Gore hanging chads for Bush votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won Then if some ballots say indentations have to be thrown out the American people will know right away who won Florida A Great idea The US Supreme Court rejected it They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gores winning would cause public acceptance and that would cast a cloud over Bushs legitimacy that would harm democratic stability Q In other words if America knows the truth that Gore won they wont accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gores victory A Yes Q Is that a legal reason to stop recounts or a political one A Lets just say in all of American history and all of American law this reason has no basis in law But that doesnt stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air Q Arent these conservative justices against judicial activism A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it Q Well if the December deadline is not binding why not count the votes A The US Supreme Court after admitting the December deadline is not binding set December as a binding deadline at pm on December Q Didnt the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline A Yes Q But but A Not to worry The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts Q So who caused Florida to miss the December deadline A The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount the rentamob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount Q So who is punished for this behavior A Gore of course Q Tell me this Floridas laws are unconstitutional A Yes Q And the laws of states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional A Yes And states have the clear intent of the voter standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida Q Then why arent the results of states thrown out A Um Becauseumthe Supreme Court doesnt say Q But if Floridas certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional we dont know who really won the election there right A Right Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about votes excluding the butterfly ballot errors Q So what do we do have a revote throw out the entire state count under a single uniform standard A No We just dont count the votes that favor Gore Q Thats completely bizarre That sounds like rank political favoritism Did the justices have any financial interest in the case A Scalias two sons are both lawyers working for Bush Thomass wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration Q Why didnt they recuse themselves A If either had recused himself the vote would be and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed Q I cant believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way A Read the opinions for yourself supremecourtdecpdf December stay stopping the recount opinionspdfpdf December opinion Q So what are the consequences of this A The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution Al Gore will lose to Americas second choice who won the all important Supreme Court vote Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins A True in a democracy But America is not a democracy In America in the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins Q So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President A He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected Soon lawless justices may constitute or even on the court Q Is there any way to stop this A YES No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate It takes votes to break a filibuster If only of the Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in the judicial reign of terror can endand one day we can hope to return to the rule of law Q What do I do now A Email this to everyone you know and write or call your senator reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes three times Kennedys margin over Nixon and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until when a president is finally chosen by most of

Products US Margin Highlights Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by per barrel to average per barrel during November Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of at exceptionally high values CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year per barrel lower than this years first quarter average High sulfur No fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly averaging per barrel in November Despite the drop of per barrel from Octobers average fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values per barrel higher than a year ago and per barrel greater that the previous fiveyear average For the first quarter of CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of per barrel in the first quarter Jetkerosene differentials versus WTI rose per barrel from the October average reaching a whopping per barrel in November In correspondence with the distillate market jetkerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals CERA expects jetkerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of per barrel Margins for US Gulf Coast sulfur residual fuel dropped by per barrel reaching per barrel below WTI during November Despite the recent widening of differentials CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months Residual fuel differentials are expected to average per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range US Demand Highlights Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about million barrels per day mbd from the October level reaching mbd for the four weeks ending December Demand is averaging less than percent below last year largely because YK concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending December over percent greater than this time last year This represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endOctober level of mb but still a record high level for early December With support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the Northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within

Differentials The fall in product prices that started in late Octoberafter a brief surge during heightened market tensions over Middle East unrestcontinued in November Average differentials for all products over crude fell with those for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported demand FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent averaged per barrel compared with per barrel in October Jetkerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over per barrel in November from Octobers average but because of current market sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil they remained high at an average of per barrel Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of all products during Octobers Middle Eastrelated price increases consequently jetkerosenes premium over heating oil narrowed in November following an easing of tensions averaging the month at per barrel compared with per barrel over heating oil in October Despite falling by per barrel from Octobers level average sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November averaging per barrel over Dated Brent High enduser prices for heating oil remain a strong deterrent to demand however provisional data for German heating oil demand in November show a fall of over percent from November levels to an average of barrels per day bd Discounts of low sulfur heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again in November averaging per barrel As was discussed last month much of the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the availability in Russian exports toward the end of October and into November however such concerns subsided leading to a widening of discounts High sulfur fuel oil discounts widened by per barrel to an average of per barrel to Dated Brent Refinery Margins Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in October but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production especially of middle distillates High jetkerosene and gasoilheating oil values kept margins buoyant but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts were the major downward influences Using CERAs illustrative yield patterns gross margins for simplehydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by per barrel over Dated Brent from Octobers level averaging per barrel in November The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of the decline with the large drop in gasoline values contributing per barrel to the fall The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA complexcracking refineries Using CERAs illustrative yield patterns gross margins averaged per barrel in November this is per barrel lower than Octobers average of which is attributable to the poorer gasoline premiums with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values European Inventories and Refinery Operations EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further bd in November averaging million barrels per day mbd again an indication of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins Output data for individual products are not yet available but the high crude runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another month of very high jetkerosene and gasoil production Despite the strong crude runs primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories did increase in November ending the month million barrels higher than Octobers level which was revised downward at million barrels There has been a small but consistent threemonth contango in the Brent futures market placing a small premium on forward months values of crude to the current months which would help to encourage stockholding These stocks represent about days forward supply of anticipated total demand in the first quarter of next yearless than days fewer supply compared with November levels for the past two years Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from million barrels to million barrels contrary to typical seasonal patterns This may reflect the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging high gasoline production levels Nevertheless this is a potential cause for concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first quarter of next year Primary middle distillate inventories however are continuing to improve Octobers total was revised upward slightly to million barrels and November ended at million barrels In addition to record levels of refinery production exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful with Novembers total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging bd A strong transatlantic arbitrage however has been causing most of these cargoes to go direct to the

Doug LeachHOUECT on AM webmaster on PM To cc Subject CERA Monthly Oil Briefing CERA Alert December TITLE CERA Monthly Oil Briefing Fundamentals Update Email Category CERA Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States In November stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels At this level they are below the highs of but well above the low levels of early see Figure Japanese crude oil inventories at endOctober were million barrels

Analysis Business Controls TO Gary Hickerson FROM Robert Johnston CC Erin Willis Elsa Piekielniak Vince Kaminski Scott Tholan RE Brazilian Coffee Crop Forecast DATE November Crop This crop flowered from September to January and was harvested fr om April to November The peak of the harvest occurred in JuneJuly The crop is currently being exported and exports from the crop will continue into the first half of The consensus from our sources is that this crop will be bigger than expected and total million bags Brazils Ministry of Agriculture Embrapa is expected to release an off icial total in the next days which may or may not be accurate The most rece nt government forecast called for million bags Growers have been issuin g similarly lower crop yield estimates for as a way of calling attention to a probable bad harvest and pressuring the government to provid e more generous financing subsidies The current dry weather impacts the crop not the crop which is largely harvested Crop receipts issued by cooperatives in Brazil are percent greater than they were in Our top source in London believes that the crop has been largely discounted by the market and that the focus should be on Crop This is the crop that should be currently flowering in Brazil but was impacted by the June frost and the October dry weather The harvest for th e crop will run from April to November and will be export ed in the second half of and in the first half of The Brazilian government is likely to release its forecast in December or Janua ry The plantings garnered expectations of a crop yield o f million bags However recent weather problems have caused a significant downgrade of this forecast to between and million bags Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential for even greater damage to the crop in the range of up to a percent drop or million bags Agronomists from Cooxupe the largest coffee cooperative in Brazil have already pegged their first estimate at million bags Again however it is critical to remember that growers tend to exaggerate weather damage which is then further exacerbated by market rumors As evidence dry weather in the spring SeptDec in Brazil of caused alarm regarding the crop Even though the dry weather did not end until December there was still time for flowering which caused many market watchers to upgrade their forecasts While analysts and growers agree that the highly irregular status of the coffee trees makes the crop one of the most difficult to evaluate the occurrence of average to normal rainfall will greatly sharpen crop forecasting efforts It is most critical for the rest of November and December Recent rains since the last week of October have begun to addres s the hydrological deficit in the soil Continued steady welldispersed rains will help offset losses but estimated irreversible damage to the expected yield of million bags from frost and dry weather to date wil l be a minimum of percent making the new yield forecast no greater than million bags A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the end of December could bring yield down to a percent loss from the forecast in the range of million bags Rain is particularly significant because the new planting in recent years h as been concentrated in the Cerrado savannah region of Northern Brazil The coffee can be mechanically harvested in this region but requires significa nt irrigation The irrigation alone will only partially offset the dry weather The frost damage from June accounts for a percent crop loss in Para na and a percent crop loss in Sao Paulo but these states only account for percent of total Brazilian production In Minas Gerais almost percent of production the crop losses are only percent Crop losses in Espiritu Santo which accounts for percent of production have been negligible Our sources will monitor rainfall and floweringcherry formation on the coffee trees which must occur by January The recent rainfall is viewed as promising and supports our basis for a million bag estimate,shankman-j,President

Jeffrey A ShankmanHOUECT on PM Robert Johnston PM To Jeff CT cc Paul CT SeungTaek NRON Brenda n nron Gary CT Darren nron Kimberly nron Scott nron Jeffrey A CT Subject Asian Credit Watch AP P Per our conversations with most of you this week Brendan and I have developed the following information on Asian Pulp Paper and its potential to trigger widescale credit problems in Asia In the past week APP has co me close to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond issues Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the Asian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market debt This week the Indonesian government further complicated the picture by attaching assets of the Sinar Mas group including APP to guarantees of Sinar Mas groups billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia BII Indonesias fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group The Wijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute before seeking a workout and corporate restructuring RJ The Immediate Problem o billion in bonds are due in on top of billion owed to the Indonesian government through the Sinar Mas group o Between now and April the APP group must come up with million fo r nine separate coupon payments coming due APP itself will owe million i n interest payments on four bonds over the next month o APP missed a February deadline for two bond payments of million on e payment has been made but the other of million is still hanging Risks are formidable with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon d holders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring o Assets are encumbered by complex crossguarantees that make it difficult to impossible to separate out individual properties o The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a delisting unless APP stock rises above the US level delisting will trigger immediate redemption clauses in some classes of bonds o The companys Indonesian assets are diseased Despite APPs apparen tly sound business model it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi n the Indonesian forestry and forest products industry o Inventory dumping by APP particularly in China has been a major factor depressing paper prices since mid o APPs management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei r cash shortages It has not reported third quarter earnings for due la st November to the US Securities and Exchange Commission although as a foreign company it has six months to report earnings versus one month for US companies Intercompany transfers may be masking serious problems within the APP group o Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened impeachment of Indonesias President Wahid lowering prospects for a government bailout of APPs parent company the Sinar Mas group and its owners the Wijaya family o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets with SP already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity APP Risk Profile APPs only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset sales or a selloff of pulp and paper inventory Neither has much chance of success APPs current strategy is to muscle its bondholders into a restructuring agreement as soon as possible most likely before an early March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due There are significant obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring from crossguarantees of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various jurisdictions to intercompany transfers that present a false picture of financial health in some of its operating companies Such obstacles ensure that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy APP is the fifth largest issuer of junk bonds in the world and has been regarded as a benchmark bon d for Indonesia Until the last few months it was the only bond in the world that traded at a premium to its own governments bonds and was the only Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the depth of the Asian crisis A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian bonds in the event of a default as investors wait to see what happens to unsecured creditors who account for percent to percent of APPs US billion in debt At the moment systemic fallout seems likely to be limited to the Asian region as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri ng the Asian financial crisis APP Key Decision Makers The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda Wijaya No others in the company are privy to all the Groups Affairs o r to corporate strategy Information is extremely closely held Sources say that the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o f the assets of APP or its subsidiaries so complex are the cross guarantees and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game engaging i n brinkmanship with their bond holders It signaled the market that it could move into a default situation on February when its paper making subsidiar y Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah failed to make payments on two different bond issues worth million On February APP finally paid the coupon on one of the bonds a US million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius just within a grace period of five business days If Tjiwi Kimia had failed to meet the deadline it would have triggered cross default clauses on a series of other bonds The second coupon payment of million for a US million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in is now late W e expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment The group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring The better its cash position is the more APP will be able to operate from a position of strength in a restructuring negotiation According to one source APP is signaling the market and its bond holde rs that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before everything collapse The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now while they still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin g left APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies some of which have significant cash flow is different from those in the parent Th is is obviously a dangerous game but one in which APP feels it has no choice but to engage The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be and the greater its chances of survival in some form Trying to keep control of the situation so that it doesnt unravel is the name of the game at this point Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their noncore subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring They have been actively shopping their China assets for several months and sources indica te that their packaging assets will also go on the block APP is still hopeful however of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group and often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas Another source said This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if you start messing with the structure lets say one group of bond holders wa nts to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer you could threaten the whole group The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors and are not in the category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan who was sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and corruption They are not saints the Indonesian government removed the Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was nationalized in based on evidence that they exceeded the percent c ap for lending to affiliates However they depend heavily on international capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would bar future access At the moment they have few alternatives to raise cash to meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales The company has built up substantial paper inventory and according to one source it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it could find a buyer This is a big if however since current prices are depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make matters worse Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th at APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets These assets include o PT Ekamas Fortuna o PT Purinusa Ekapersada o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper o Gold Hongye Paper o Gold Hai Paper Kunshan Co o Jin Yu Qingyuan Tissue Paper Industry The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the assets on offer but had held back because of the impenetrable cross guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity The executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would finance an acquisition Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin a factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intracompany prices Once the company is broken up into pieces it will have to rely on the worl d market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected It is said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be considerably less One of the problems with APPs brinkmanship strategy is that it is lowering the value of its assets Companies will not be willing to pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its noncore assets Restructuring is imminent creating opportunities for investors o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric es and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia o A restructuring will release some of APPs assets which are considere d attractive except for those in Indonesia APP is the worlds low cost producer of pulp and paper with substantial assets in Indonesia China an d India Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current overcapacity i n the domestic Chinese market APP accounts for percent of the Chinese market for printing and fine paper o Some play is available from price volatility as APP continues to tease investors by keeping them guessing about its actual

Candace CT Shamim CT Harry PapadopoulosENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Kevin NRON Tom CT Scott nron Dan NRON Paul CT Karolina CT Meindert CT Louis CT Niamh CT cc Subject ARA Coal Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt for nearby delivery thru to Q this week the tone of the mkt remains very firm EDFT seemingly still unsure of its burn schedule one week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery We offered equivalent of cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability to extract from the mkt anything better than cif for delivery December period Indeed due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at on a cif basis Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts there is no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices Many were already well sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets Certain South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on track stating that it wont be until May next year that they are fully back on track again While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets Q still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied Still could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q at fob and JanDec at watch this space SPOT TRADES While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various channels it has been a week without any spot business As per above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements rather than pay these high prices in advance We are also not too aggressive at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot buyers are eventually forced to the table SELLING SIDE Mission still have not covered their December requirements Our offer of GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and GBP FOR Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material We said that he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell that wud be very kind The sage continues We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke Bremen for between mmt mil tonnes per year starting Jan Prices will be linked to the BAW Index HEWVW combined are tendering for mt for Q shipment into Hamburg We have offered cif Electrabel looking for mmt each month EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q Veag mmt cif Rostock for NovJun Endesa capes for H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working various possibilities of swapping material for While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward Fenosa mmt of Low Vol US material for but so far unable to get an offer basis this material Innogy looking for upto mil tonnes for delivery throughout Bewag still have tender out for mmt for next year where we are looking to put a proposal to them basis Polish material BUYING SIDE Continue to work Emerald for material out of the US hopefully persistence will pay and we may close something this week for shipments Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q shipment FOB Santa Marta at basis btulb Ensham had a lower quality coal cape quantity on offer at fob Oz but unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect to find a home for Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q which would equate to somewhere in the region cif ara Would be good to test viability of shipping thru this port In tandem with year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen obligations NCSC looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African material for EOL What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week yet Between Thursday and Friday we did trades via EOL equating to just over mt Glencore was the main sponsor of the action on Friday intent on driving prices higher they were a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments with no coal assets as a backstop Life to date we have traded mt on EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the mil mark this week We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at Coaltrans in two weeks time GAMEPLAN Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing tonnage to play with for next year To date our Drummond long has been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply out of Puerto Drummond for the first months of next year With the demand that we have on the table today we could turn our mill long into a short with no problem at all While there will always be a level where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so at the traded levels for today despite the absolute levels being the upper end of the historic range We still have a little way to go to actually signing contracts which secures us the year deal with stadtwerke Bremen but on the assumption we do we must start looking at our supply strategy for the first months of next year where it looks to be most challenging The business we will be fantastic for creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we can supply of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace Best Regards Jez,shankman-j,President

can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPCs terminal As you know DPC is owned today by Enron MSEB GE and Bechtel At year end Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses

Heat CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Mon October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of October For November the differential is expected to average US for a resulti ng AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for

Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market namely the Drummond Force Majeure What remains now is cif mkt which is in backwardisation for Q and Q versus the rest of but where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around million mt for the end of September Indeed utilities and traders alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and play the cash carry game This has certainly paid dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted productionshipments from various geographies While the whole curve has shifted north as a result of early buying interest for the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q and Q prices increase by some over past weeks to absolute values at cif ARA this represents a prm of between over JanDec run Believe the front end will continue to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates increase in prodn synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices from the high levels they are today Control of FOB origin prices through continued consolidation in the production side of the industry could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible SPOT TRADES Bot

tonnage traded via EOL with the activity that went on this week There continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we really need to focus on converting the increasing number of guest user IDs we are giving out into actual transactions on the system many are still afraid of the technology many are still ignorant of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply dont have the authority hence we continue to focus on preaching the word to all and sundry Highlight this week was having Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were propping the mkt up on the buy side We are moving ahead with posting options on the SECA contract on EOL GAMEPLAN Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for and with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for from the high levels today RBCT ARA Cape combined with a somewhat weaker tone in continental power prices for we are fairly keen to hit some of this business at current price levels We have benefited from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from other geographies such as South Africa Australia US and Russia that will allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book Have extended dlist this

can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPCs terminal As you know DPC is owned today by Enron MSEB GE and Bechtel At year end Enrons will be split to Enron and new investor Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC which is heavily influenced but not controlled by Enron The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA and Enron has this through Metgas Under the TARA Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC In addition Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here Today Metgas is owned and controlled by Enron so Enron has control But in any sale of Metgas Enrons control will be lessened Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation we will reduce Enrons equity position to or less which means we are at best sharing control with someone else or maybe a group of someone elses

PM To Michelle D CT cc Gary CT James D nron Richard nron Jaime nron John CT Jeff CT Kristin CT Scott nron Subject California Power As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on for the California electricity crisis state officials around Governor Gray Davis have toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be paid by the State of California One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity As we reported last week Davis and his aides want to pay around to dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to determine the price but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over longterm contracts Our sources in Washington Sacramento and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish longterm power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term This weeks legislative activities in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for superpriority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy Audit Untangling Utility Relationships California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the to billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the powergenerating and powerdistributing companies under a holding company umbrella Of course that means that some of the power PGE and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the risky debt premium that PGE and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial day deadline In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension Debt Restructuring Guarantees but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up during a day forbearance period whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now Davis idea as he laid it out in the meeting is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities forward rate base or by establishing a mediumterm repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to paydown their debt One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can pay down this debt There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations but he remains opposed to using direct state money This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility Eminent DomainReregulation Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political advisers have with nonmarket solutions to the energy crisis Although the Governors aides actually believe the weapon is more a way to force eventual agreement than an actual solution the talk returns frequently to these nonmarket mechanisms We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the Tuesday deadline If we make no progress If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will retake the plants and equipment and run them ourselves a close political aide to Davis said We will absorb the plants the transmission lines and the reserved parking places of the executives The legislature would agree in a second,shankman-j,President

Doug LeachHOUECT on AM webmaster on PM To cc Subject CERA Monthly Oil Briefing CERA Alert December TITLE CERA Monthly Oil Briefing Fundamentals Update Email Category CERA Monthly Briefing CERA Knowledge Area World Oil In the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market Furthermore the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals If the cutoff lasts through December the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions and exports may again cease At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect CERAs price outlook for remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for WTI However this outlook is based on OPECs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of WTI for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first The downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in OPEC output Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UNcontrolled oil for food program as of December in protest over the rejection by the Security Councils sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule Iraqs pricing was judged by the UN overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues Iraq partially resumed exporting on December Since then about mbd has been exported from the Mina alBakr terminal in the Persian Gulf Prior to the shutdown Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of mbd for November as compared with mbd for the third quarter Exports for November were about mbd from Mina alBakr and about mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market Iraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues In the midst of this dispute the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on December it became effective on December and has been accepted by Iraq As of December Iraqs revised export price for Ceyhan proposed for the remainder of December has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee Additionally the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina alBakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina alBakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina alBakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil As currently structured the deal would violate UN sanctions but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship The exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina alBakr again There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints Consequently the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook Iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office Secretary of Statedesignate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in Washington A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of mbd However only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd In CERAs view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition Switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage Given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil Supply Trends NonOPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production curtailed in October by about bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith Mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of Mexican liquids capacity Norways output increased bd from October to November as maintenance season ended Norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbd Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes Russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in November after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from July though October Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged mbd in Novemberdown mbd from the October level The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first days of December to roughly mbd Iraq resumed exports of about mbd on December which raised production to mbd Assuming no change in Iraqs current production stance Iraqi production would average mbd for December On a quarterly basis the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd These production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November without UN authorization and are continuing Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories DOE data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in September and reached million barrels in midDecember see Figure Since prices weakened in late November crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from million barrels Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States In November stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels At this level they are below the highs of but well above the low levels of early see Figure Japanese crude oil inventories at endOctober were million barrels

averaging per barrel in November The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of the decline with the large drop in gasoline values contributing per barrel to the fall The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA complexcracking refineries Using CERAs illustrative yield patterns gross margins averaged per barrel in November this is per barrel lower than Octobers average of which is attributable to the poorer gasoline premiums with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values European Inventories and Refinery Operations EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further bd in November averaging million barrels per day mbd again an indication of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins Output data for individual products are not yet available but the high crude runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another month of very high jetkerosene and gasoil production Despite the strong crude runs primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories did increase in November ending the month million barrels higher than Octobers level which was revised downward at million barrels There has been a small but consistent threemonth contango in the Brent futures market placing a small premium on forward months values of crude to the current months which would help to encourage stockholding These stocks represent about days forward supply of anticipated total demand in the first quarter of next yearless than days fewer supply compared with November levels for the past two years Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from million barrels to million barrels contrary to typical seasonal patterns This may reflect the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging high gasoline production levels Nevertheless this is a potential cause for concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first quarter of next year Primary middle distillate inventories however are continuing to improve Octobers total was revised upward slightly to million barrels and November ended at million barrels In addition to record levels of refinery production exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful with Novembers total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging bd A strong transatlantic arbitrage however has been causing most of these cargoes to go direct to the

Products US Margin Highlights Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by per barrel to average per barrel during November Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of at exceptionally high values CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year per barrel lower than this years first quarter average High sulfur No fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly averaging per barrel in November Despite the drop of per barrel from Octobers average fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values per barrel higher than a year ago and per barrel greater that the previous fiveyear average For the first quarter of CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of per barrel in the first quarter Jetkerosene differentials versus WTI rose per barrel from the October average reaching a whopping per barrel in November In correspondence with the distillate market jetkerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals CERA expects jetkerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of per barrel Margins for US Gulf Coast sulfur residual fuel dropped by per barrel reaching per barrel below WTI during November Despite the recent widening of differentials CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months Residual fuel differentials are expected to average per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year at the high end of the historical range US Demand Highlights Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about million barrels per day mbd from the October level reaching mbd for the four weeks ending December Demand is averaging less than percent below last year largely because YK concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending December over percent greater than this time last year This represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endOctober level of mb but still a record high level for early December With support from low home heating oil inventories particularly in the Northeast distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the October level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending December Despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average mb during the fourth quarter Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to mbd for the four weeks ending December a decline of about mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level Demand for residual fuel is currently percent greater than last year and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the to mbd range during the first quarter of US Inventory Highlights Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to mb increasing almost mb from the endOctober value Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending December Forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter However CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December Despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period Primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever Although stocks are low CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter Assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December This moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months The rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from October reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks end This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within

ShankmanHOUECT on PM Ben Macklowe on PM To cc Subject Fw Analysis of Supreme Court decision Original Message From Elizabeth Prickett Morgan To Sent Thursday December PM Subject Analysis of Supreme Court decision A friend sent me the following QA it sums up the legal issues very clearly Q Im not a lawyer and I dont understand the recent Supreme Court decision in Bush v Gore Can you explain it to me A Sure Im a lawyer I read it It says Bush wins even if Gore got the most votes Q But wait a second The US Supreme Court has to give a reason right A Right Q So Bush wins because handcounts are illegal A Oh no Six of the justices twothirds majority believed the handcounts were legal and should be done Q Oh So the justices did not believe that the handcounts would find any legal ballots A Nope The five conservative justices clearly held and all nine justices agreed that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate number of ballots which are not punched in a clean complete way by the voter So there are legal votes that should be counted but cant be Q Oh Does this have something to do with states rights Dont conservatives love that A Generally yes These five justices have held that the federal government has no business telling a sovereign state university it cant steal trade secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law Nor does the federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns in schools Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause to force states to take measures to stop violence against women Q Is there an exception in this case A Yes the Gore exception States have no rights to have their own state elections when it can result in Gore being elected President This decision is limited to only this situation Q Cmon The Supremes didnt really say that Youre exaggerating A Nope They held Our consideration is limited to the present circumstances or the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities Q What complexities A They dont say Q Ill bet I know the reason I heard Jim Baker say this The votes cant be counted because the Florida Supreme Court changed the rules of the election after it was held Right A Dead wrong The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme Court did not change the rules of the election But the US Supreme Court found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong Q Huh A The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote is clear intent of the voter The Florida Court was condemned for not adopting a clearer standard Q I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislatures law after the election A Right Q So whats the problem A They should have The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court should have adopted adequate statewide standards for determining what is a legal vote Q I thought only the Legislature could adopt new law A Right Q So if the Court had adopted new standards I thought it would have been overturned A Right Youre catching on Q If the Court had adopted new standards it would have been overturned for changing the rules And if it didnt its overturned for not changing the rules That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did legal votes could never be counted A Right Next question Q Wait wait I thought the problem was equal protection that some counties counted votes differently from others Isnt that a problem A It sure is Across the nation we vote in a hodgepodge of systems Some like the opticalscanners in largely Republicanleaning counties record of the votes Some like the punchcard systems in largely Democraticleaning counties record only of the votes So approximately of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can Q Aha Thats a severe equalprotection problem A No its not The Supreme Court wasnt worried about the of Democratic ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida That complexity was not a problem Q Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more than Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan A Nope The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his highest best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with Holocaust survivors who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler Q Yikes So what was the serious equal protection problem A The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the of Democrats largely AfricanAmerican disenfranchised The problem is that somewhat less than of the ballots may have been determined under slightly different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their best to accomplish the legislative mandate of clear intent of the voter may have a slightly opinion about the voters intent Q Hmmm OK so if those votes are thrown out you can still count the votes where everyone agrees the voters intent is clear A Nope Q Why not A No time Q No time to count legal votes where everyone even Republicans agree the intent is clear Why not A Because December was yesterday Q Is December a deadline for counting votes A No January is the deadline In Hawaiis votes werent counted until January Q So why is December important A December is a deadline by which Congress cant challenge the results Q What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court A Nothing Q But I thought A The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its work by December to make things easier for Congress The United States Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding Q But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes counted by December A They would have made it but the five conservative justices stopped the recount last Saturday Q Why A Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal Q So why not separate the votes into piles indentations for Gore hanging chads for Bush votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won Then if some ballots say indentations have to be thrown out the American people will know right away who won Florida A Great idea The US Supreme Court rejected it They held that such counts would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gores winning would cause public acceptance and that would cast a cloud over Bushs legitimacy that would harm democratic stability Q In other words if America knows the truth that Gore won they wont accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gores victory A Yes Q Is that a legal reason to stop recounts or a political one A Lets just say in all of American history and all of American law this reason has no basis in law But that doesnt stop the five conservatives from creating new law out of thin air Q Arent these conservative justices against judicial activism A Yes when liberal judges are perceived to have done it Q Well if the December deadline is not binding why not count the votes A The US Supreme Court after admitting the December deadline is not binding set December as a binding deadline at pm on December Q Didnt the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for arbitrarily setting a deadline A Yes Q But but A Not to worry The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets for other courts Q So who caused Florida to miss the December deadline A The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount the rentamob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating officials and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount Q So who is punished for this behavior A Gore of course Q Tell me this Floridas laws are unconstitutional A Yes Q And the laws of states that allow votes to be cast or counted differently are unconstitutional A Yes And states have the clear intent of the voter standard that the US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida Q Then why arent the results of states thrown out A Um Becauseumthe Supreme Court doesnt say Q But if Floridas certification includes counts expressly declared by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional we dont know who really won the election there right A Right Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won Florida by about votes excluding the butterfly ballot errors Q So what do we do have a revote throw out the entire state count under a single uniform standard A No We just dont count the votes that favor Gore Q Thats completely bizarre That sounds like rank political favoritism Did the justices have any financial interest in the case A Scalias two sons are both lawyers working for Bush Thomass wife is collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush administration Q Why didnt they recuse themselves A If either had recused himself the vote would be and the Florida Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed Q I cant believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way A Read the opinions for yourself supremecourtdecpdf December stay stopping the recount opinionspdfpdf December opinion Q So what are the consequences of this A The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our Constitution Al Gore will lose to Americas second choice who won the all important Supreme Court vote Q I thought in a democracy the guy with the most votes wins A True in a democracy But America is not a democracy In America in the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins Q So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President A He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure that the will of the people is less and less respected Soon lawless justices may constitute or even on the court Q Is there any way to stop this A YES No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate It takes votes to break a filibuster If only of the Democratic Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be democratically elected in the judicial reign of terror can endand one day we can hope to return to the rule of law Q What do I do now A Email this to everyone you know and write or call your senator reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes three times Kennedys margin over Nixon and that you believe that VOTERS rather than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people you want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until when a president is finally chosen by most of the American people Mark H Levine Attorney at Law,shankman-j,President

some other things going on that the LNG group is trying to trade with El Paso for LNG space around the country as well Jeff Janet R Dietrich AM To Jeffrey A CT cc Mike CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Hey guys no real need to read all of this I just want to be sure your team and our team are closely coordinating on the Elba Island tolling agreements your team and gas sales agreements our team These discussions have been going on for about eight months now and I want to be sure this is all worthwhile Phil Demoes is spending a considerable amount of time coordinating and negotiating with Southern Co and other sales customers for the LNG offtake agreements Im assuming Doug Arnell is your lead on deciding and executing on the strategy at Elba There is a CONSIDERABLE amount of money to be made depending on your view of the longterm supply curve for LNG Question Are the right people involved here on both sides to develop and execute on the strategy at Elba What is our specific strategy at Elba and can we accelerate our negotiations on the various contracts here Please advise Thanks Forwarded by Janet R DietrichHOUECT on AM Phil NRON AM To Janet R CT Gil NRON Ed CT cc Dan J CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL Janet Gil and Ed Please note Les latest summary of Elba Things seem to be coming to a head there Southern Co was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from the terminal We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by Les I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this So Cos latest offer was Hub for all dtd So Co wants dtd at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining dtd at Elba or Destin at our option We have not discussed what a price at Destin should be So Co has some leverage with El Paso that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below Additionally they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at Elba We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday Let me know if you have any questions Forwarded by Phil DeMoesCorpEnron on AM Les Webber ENRONDEVELOPMENT PM To Doug ArnellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Nancy CorbetENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Daniel R RogersENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Shelley NRON Phil NRON David L CT Subject SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL GREETINGS On November Southern LNG advised the FERC that it has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island With this withdrawal the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the day period allowed by FERC procedures This gives us until December to file which presumably would be extended until Monday December Our filing will be of an adversarial nature so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing which we will commence drafting on November Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel so please advise us re any additions in that regard At the same time this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions On Wednesday November we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a headsup regarding our likely response to Southern LNGs proposed letter agreement dated November We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification and the Stabilization Project that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday November after we received a copy of Southern LNGs letter to the FERC he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision hence had not been positioned to return the favor Mr Varagona will be in Houston on November and and he wants to meet with us He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso take on the quality risk in return for our firming up our volumes to El Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx per MMBtu Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost He said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer to which I responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and for El Paso to respond with I dont think that will work Mr Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter AgreementTerm Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies It just wont work As a consequence he stated that Clarke Smith head of El Paso Merchant Energy has already contacted or will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter Apparently these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years He also alluded to the possibility that Mr Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton for less than obvious reasons to me Mr Varagona further advised me that a DukeWilliams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal divestment of this asset was required I understand as part of the El PasoCoastal merger This situation gives added impetus to development of the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal However we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear However should we decide to so compromise we must either fully engage Southern LNG in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with El Paso In the case of Southern LNG we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things namely their way and who are totally opposed to working with Enron I would recommend any compromise with El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with Southern LNG

has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly behind per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was heading swiftly to While there had been some nervous short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and in general have refused to commit to these numbers The lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of course mkt psychology with it While producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to Several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be an additional million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for destination Europe most likely On the flip side Kepco will be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking for some million tonnes of

November stand at million mt out of a running total of million from its inception As the figures suggest there is increasing activityliquidity in the market with the arrival of several new players in recent weeks most notably AEP Increased volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECAs traded in the OTC market with more and more utilities who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party RWE has been the latest SECA virgin to lose its cherry closing a deal with ourselves early last week on Q through TFS We are now offering our products in Euros aswell the good old green back much to the confusion of one or two of our clients At current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the mill mark by the end of the year GAMEPLAN We are currently long to the tune of mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some mill mt weighted pretty evenly across Q Q and Q backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both Richards Bay and Drummond We are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term Cal business while running a European short posn which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt Shud the the European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the money options which we wud utilise to execute any physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped

Jeffrey A CT George CT cc Subject The Way Forward Now I know why God made lawyers Below is Kevin Liss latest analysis His main thesis is that there is a huge return available to the company that will take the tax risk We just have to find that company Dan Forwarded by Daniel ReckHOUECT on PM Kevin NRON PM To Daniel CT Tim CT cc Stephen H CT Subject The Way Forward Dan in response to your question yesterday it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank DB had contemplated In that respect last weeks IRS announcement leaves things unchanged Thats the good news However in light of last weeks IRS announcement DB is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming Pacificorps existing letter rulings which they have told us was critical to them It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a nonstarter from their perspective at least based upon the present plan of operations Tim is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their runofmine coal consistently with their existing rulings I doubt it but if not we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with Pacificorp I believe that Pacificorp still needs to unload their facilities and they may still be able to leverage off of their existing rulings which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS Without a deal with DB what are our options now First it is important to recognize that we still have options The IRS has not killed synfuel There has not been any change in the substantive law Last weeks announcement was just that an announcement of the IRSs point of view The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business which has been an important source of comfort to many investors but not necessarily vital Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having a private letter ruling from the IRS generally in reliance on an opinion of outside counsel We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorps facilties meaning we would relocate them and continue running runofmine coal the IRS be damned and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than Pacificorp In short we would need companies who are willing to rely on Pacificorps existing rulings period along with an appropriate indemnity It seems to me that if the price is right someone ought to be willing to step up While the risk is now greater the potential returns are potentially mindblowing and an equity player ought to be able to get an opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits notwithstanding the IRS current view of the law It seems to me that this is the only approach that makes sense Alternatively Pacificorps facilities could revert back to being a pure coal fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRSs recent announcement The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that process waste coal fines so such facilities could still qualify for new private letter rulings The IRS announcement defines the term waste coal fines very vaguely not specifying either the coal size or what it is that makes coal fines properly viewed as waste coal fines If you think in lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their announcement I can envision that Enron could synthetically create waste coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility customers to provide for the sale of only coal of inches or greater resulting in a residual category of unwanted coal that we could separately market to synfuel plants as waste coal fines In other words they could be fairly described as waste insofar as another coal customer specifically excluded it from their contract In addition the IRS announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output as some commontators had feared which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity However there are real difficulties with this approach First the relevant language in the IRS announcement defining waste coal fines is not real statutory law It is basically just an IRS policy statement meaning that we cannot bind the IRS to it So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the IRSs choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were statutory law Also Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste fines is fines from true waste ponds Even if the taxpayer can argue over the meaning of the term waste fines the IRS can stick to their understanding of the term at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue a new ruling In short the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly or waste fines incidental to mining operations If you are not going to be able to get a new ruling anyway whats the point of going back to being a coal fine processing facility But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines generally ie not merely waste coal fines as well as runofmine coal Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more restrictive than the ones that they already have That is truly putting value at risk In my view the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing rulings as essentially above market rulings insofar as they go farther than the IRS currently allows giving them a competitive advantage over other synfuel operators who never got a ruling It seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal Kevin Liss x,shankman-j,President

Jeffrey A ShankmanHOUECT on PM Robert Johnston PM To Jeff CT cc Paul CT SeungTaek NRON Brenda n nron Gary CT Darren nron Kimberly nron Scott nron Jeffrey A CT Subject Asian Credit Watch AP P Per our conversations with most of you this week Brendan and I have developed the following information on Asian Pulp Paper and its potential to trigger widescale credit problems in Asia In the past week APP has co me close to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond issues Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the Asian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market debt This week the Indonesian government further complicated the picture by attaching assets of the Sinar Mas group including APP to guarantees of Sinar Mas groups billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia BII Indonesias fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group The Wijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute before seeking a workout and corporate restructuring RJ The Immediate Problem o billion in bonds are due in on top of billion owed to the Indonesian government through the Sinar Mas group o Between now and April the APP group must come up with million fo r nine separate coupon payments coming due APP itself will owe million i n interest payments on four bonds over the next month o APP missed a February deadline for two bond payments of million on e payment has been made but the other of million is still hanging Risks are formidable with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon d holders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring o Assets are encumbered by complex crossguarantees that make it difficult to impossible to separate out individual properties o The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a delisting unless APP stock rises above the US level delisting will trigger immediate redemption clauses in some classes of bonds o The companys Indonesian assets are diseased Despite APPs apparen tly sound business model it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi n the Indonesian forestry and forest products industry o Inventory dumping by APP particularly in China has been a major factor depressing paper prices since mid o APPs management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei r cash shortages It has not reported third quarter earnings for due la st November to the US Securities and Exchange Commission although as a foreign company it has six months to report earnings versus one month for US companies Intercompany transfers may be masking serious problems within the APP group o Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened impeachment of Indonesias President Wahid lowering prospects for a government bailout of APPs parent company the Sinar Mas group and its owners the Wijaya family o There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets with SP already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity APP Risk Profile APPs only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset sales or a selloff of pulp and paper inventory Neither has much chance of success APPs current strategy is to muscle its bondholders into a restructuring agreement as soon as possible most likely before an early March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due There are significant obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring from crossguarantees of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various jurisdictions to intercompany transfers that present a false picture of financial health in some of its operating companies Such obstacles ensure that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy APP is the fifth largest issuer of junk bonds in the world and has been regarded as a benchmark bon d for Indonesia Until the last few months it was the only bond in the world that traded at a premium to its own governments bonds and was the only Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the depth of the Asian crisis A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian bonds in the event of a default as investors wait to see what happens to unsecured creditors who account for percent to percent of APPs US billion in debt At the moment systemic fallout seems likely to be limited to the Asian region as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri ng the Asian financial crisis APP Key Decision Makers The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda Wijaya No others in the company are privy to all the Groups Affairs o r to corporate strategy Information is extremely closely held Sources say that the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o f the assets of APP or its subsidiaries so complex are the cross guarantees and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game engaging i n brinkmanship with their bond holders It signaled the market that it could move into a default situation on February when its paper making subsidiar y Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah failed to make payments on two different bond issues worth million On February APP finally paid the coupon on one of the bonds a US million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius just within a grace period of five business days If Tjiwi Kimia had failed to meet the deadline it would have triggered cross default clauses on a series of other bonds The second coupon payment of million for a US million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in is now late W e expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment The group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring The better its cash position is the more APP will be able to operate from a position of strength in a restructuring negotiation According to one source APP is signaling the market and its bond holde rs that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before everything collapse The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now while they still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin g left APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies some of which have significant cash flow is different from those in the parent Th is is obviously a dangerous game but one in which APP feels it has no choice but to engage The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be and the greater its chances of survival in some form Trying to keep control of the situation so that it doesnt unravel is the name of the game at this point Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their noncore subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring They have been actively shopping their China assets for several months and sources indica te that their packaging assets will also go on the block APP is still hopeful however of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group and often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas Another source said This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if you start messing with the structure lets say one group of bond holders wa nts to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer you could threaten the whole group The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors and are not in the category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan who was sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and corruption They are not saints the Indonesian government removed the Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was nationalized in based on evidence that they exceeded the percent c ap for lending to affiliates However they depend heavily on international capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would bar future access At the moment they have few alternatives to raise cash to meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales The company has built up substantial paper inventory and according to one source it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it could find a buyer This is a big if however since current prices are depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make matters worse Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th at APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets These assets include o PT Ekamas Fortuna o PT Purinusa Ekapersada o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper o Gold Hongye Paper o Gold Hai Paper Kunshan Co o Jin Yu Qingyuan Tissue Paper Industry The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the assets on offer but had held back because of the impenetrable cross guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity The executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would finance an acquisition Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin a factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intracompany prices Once the company is broken up into pieces it will have to rely on the worl d market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected It is said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be considerably less One of the problems with APPs brinkmanship strategy is that it is lowering the value of its assets Companies will not be willing to pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its noncore assets Restructuring is imminent creating opportunities for investors o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric es and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia o A restructuring will release some of APPs assets which are considere d attractive except for those in Indonesia APP is the worlds low cost producer of pulp and paper with substantial assets in Indonesia China an d India Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current overcapacity i n the domestic Chinese market APP accounts for percent of the Chinese market for printing and fine paper o Some play is available from price volatility as APP continues to tease investors by keeping them guessing about its actual cash situation,shankman-j,President

Candace CT Harry PapadopoulosENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Katrina CT Jez CT Kevin NRON Tom CT Scott nron Dan NRON cc Paul CT Karolina CT Meindert CT Louis CT Niamh CT Gregor CT Florian CT Subject ARA Coal Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q and Q Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versus the rest of the year versus RBCTARA and with the US mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end east coast trading fob barge there is little sign of relief in the short term Q Fob ARA is now trading close to with JanDec around Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango for the remainder of the year however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this if anything demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango This said we cannot preclude a shift higher of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around Fob South Africa equivalent to there is still plenty of business to be done for and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and see game we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated its implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology SPOT TRADES mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt of Prima quality from KPC for Nov shipment at Fob Indo basis kcalkg mt option of Prima quality from KPC to be shipped latest end June at Fob Indo basis kcalkg x mt Put Options from TXU for AprilSep and OctMar respectively Strike price is basis Amsterdam Rotterdam and expiry is Feb and Aug Premium

delivery into Nordenham at cif Dyckerhoff offered x mt of generic South Africa material for AprilNovember delivery at fob barge BUYING SIDE Duiker Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for they are due to get back to us within the next few days Drummond offered us a year deal staring in at Fob Colombia thanks Krutrade working numbers to put an aggressive multiyear offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian mkt at present we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business going forward Anker talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for they are looking at somewhere around the fob Maputo level Masefield currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for Coal Procurement talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for Currently working with US on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for but currently remain apart We currently have some mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in AmsterdanRotterdam to sell as fillers into backend of the year and we have the MV Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov with mmt of Australian coal to sell into the mkt EOL Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an eplatform which will provide mkts against Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point Details of operational functionality are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckons it will be operational end of first quarter Rather than see this as competition if successful it could provide us with more access to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers Total volumes for EOL to date are at mt We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options As volatility increases other nontraditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents Next project is to get quotes in Euros and after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL GAMEPLAN We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between and Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South African material to add to our Colombian long Overall our position is some million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers it is difficult to call this mkt in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options Best Regards

Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of October For November the differential is expected to average US for a resulti ng AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for

Candace CT Shamim CT Harry PapadopoulosENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Kevin NRON Tom CT Scott nron Dan NRON Paul CT Karolina CT Meindert CT Louis CT Niamh CT cc Subject ARA Coal Mkt Summary MKT SUMMARY Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt for nearby delivery thru to Q this week the tone of the mkt remains very firm EDFT seemingly still unsure of its burn schedule one week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery We offered equivalent of cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability to extract from the mkt anything better than cif for delivery December period Indeed due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at on a cif basis Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts there is no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices Many were already well sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets Certain South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on track stating that it wont be until May next year that they are fully back on track again While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets Q still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied Still could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q at fob and JanDec at watch this space SPOT TRADES While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various channels it has been a week without any spot business As per above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements rather than pay these high prices in advance We are also not too aggressive at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot buyers are eventually forced to the table SELLING SIDE Mission still have not covered their December requirements Our offer of GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and GBP FOR Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material We said that he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell that wud be very kind The sage continues We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke Bremen for between mmt mil tonnes per year starting Jan Prices will be linked to the BAW Index HEWVW combined are tendering for mt for Q shipment into Hamburg We have offered cif Electrabel looking for mmt each month EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q Veag mmt cif Rostock for NovJun Endesa capes for H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working various possibilities of swapping material for While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward Fenosa mmt of Low Vol US material for but so far unable to get an offer basis this material Innogy looking for upto mil tonnes for delivery throughout Bewag still have tender out for mmt for next year where we are looking to put a proposal to them basis Polish material BUYING SIDE Continue to work Emerald for material out of the US hopefully persistence will pay and we may close something this week for shipments Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q shipment FOB Santa Marta at basis btulb Ensham had a lower quality coal cape quantity on offer at fob Oz but unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect to find a home for Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q which would equate to somewhere in the region cif ara Would be good to test viability of shipping thru this port In tandem with year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen obligations NCSC looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African material for EOL What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week yet Between Thursday and Friday we did trades via EOL equating to just over mt Glencore was the main sponsor of the action on Friday intent on driving prices higher they were a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments with no coal assets as a backstop Life to date we have traded mt on EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the mil mark this week We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at Coaltrans in two weeks time GAMEPLAN Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing tonnage to play with for next year To date our Drummond long has been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply out of Puerto Drummond for the first months of next year With the demand that we have on the table today we could turn our mill long into a short with no problem at all While there will always be a level where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so at the traded levels for today despite the absolute levels being the upper end of the historic range We still have a little way to go to actually signing contracts which secures us the year deal with stadtwerke Bremen but on the assumption we do we must start looking at our supply strategy for the first months of next year where it looks to be most challenging The business we will be fantastic for creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we can supply of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace Best Regards Jez,shankman-j,President

a noncompete for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do It is

McDonaldENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW Agreement Restricting Power Generation Competition in Asia Pacific Region General Counsels At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman I am sending this email to you pursuant to the Enron Corp Policy on Noncompetition I would appreciate if you would check with your CEOCOO regarding this email and respond to me by Friday September if you have questions or concerns Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions that bind Enron affiliates by Monday October Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific Enron Asia PacificAfricaChina Enron APACHI is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company Newco Newco would be charged with making the shareholders investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders respective stakes in Newco The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a dumping ground for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia As a result Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the MarubeniEnron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates The following is a summary of these competition provisions Enron affiliates with the exceptions stated below could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region as defined below after first offering the opportunity to Newco If Newco declines the opportunity Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction OM offtaker or risk management services There are a number of exceptions to this rule a small projects involving MW or less b projects in which Enron owns less than a interest c projects initiated by our SK joint venture d Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron e projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than of the value of the acquisition and f situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction Affiliates will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publiclyowned eg Azurix Asia Pacific Region will be defined to include Brunei China including Hong Kong and Macau South Korea North Korea Taiwan Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand Myanmar the Philippines Malaysia Indonesia East Timor Singapore Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands including Guam Saipan the Federated States of Micronesia and Fiji but excluding Hawaii It does not include Japan and Australia The competition clause would survive until the earlier of a Enron selling its interest in Newco or b December Thank you Bruce Lundstrom General

Mahoney AM To Mike CT Jeffrey A CT John L CT Greg CT cc Subject how to go forward in the oil markets CUSTOMER BUSINESS EOL Jeff I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the group are good starting points I dont feel this will increase revenues for us in as our efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort Both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on Please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates I plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that Im assembling in London By end October the London office will have managers associates and analyst in our group This is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside about success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron I think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in London and Im putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every European country Please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business Cant help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future Having seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume This is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system The challenge is how can we put up more volumes more markets and tighter ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to have I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct nd with Koch Dynergy Entergy Willams and a few others Are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have This is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform I dont feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers We are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different etrading sites BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS This has always received lukewarm interest from Enron I believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on that alone So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical business Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest financial commitment Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor We can candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets We have a credit department that have done a poor job if any at all in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with petrobras pertamina petrolimex sinochem sinopec egpc nnpc if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes We are also the worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform Our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many endusers who will insist on a greater performance guarantee As we discussed briefly in Singapore I think there are several airlines that we could target in the US for physical supply I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders Previously I have not gone after this business because I didnt believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters Please consider this I will fax you a tender offer from Japan Airlines and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars That kind of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forwardthis message was more to highlight how Im trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment Lastly on that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business At the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based system and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT people instead of traders I will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT department,shankman-j,President

emailemailjspeta Companies Turn to Grades and Employees Go to Court By REED ABELSON An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies At issue is the ranking of managers professionals and sometimes lowerlevel employees from best to worst or grading them on a bell curve and then using that ranking to help determine pay and sometimes whether to fire someone In their suits all filed over the last year or so employees at Microsoft Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others white males over blacks and women younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems also known as forced rankings or distributions as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them At companies that do not compare employees with one another this way nearly every employee can come away feeling above average like the children of Lake Wobegon But under the grading system managers are forced to identify some people as low performers At General Electric for example supervisors identify the top percent and bottom percent of their managerial and professional employees every year The bottom percent are not likely to stay As John F Welch Jr General Electrics chief executive wrote last month to shareholders A company that bets its future on its people must remove that lower percent and keep removing it every year always raising the bar of performance and increasing the quality of its leadership Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard But recently the concept has been catching on more broadly according to management consultants One reason is that as the economy slows companies often lay off employees Cisco for example announced earlier this month that it would let go as many as workers and would use grading as one way to identify people to lay off Companies are playing their version of Survivor said David Thomas a professor at the Harvard Business School Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr Welch long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is likely to view the process as unfair A students love grades F students hate grades said John Sullivan a human resources professor at San Francisco State University But the techniques which some employees label with terms like rank and yank have come under sharp criticism While they appear to offer an objective way to judge employees they can be vulnerable to bias Mr Thomas said Managers may stereotype employees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career potential deciding that older workers for example may have a harder time keeping up with new technology In some cases managers can view these systems as a tool to be used to weed out the ones you dont want said Thomas S McLeod a lawyer in Canton Mich who represents employees suing Ford in another case Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a bell curve in which a small number of employees get the highest and lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the middle The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a very large group of random individuals not small groups What is more across a company people who belong to a particularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them must be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit You end up with dysfunctional results said Edward E Lawler III a business professor at the University of Southern California Some lawsuits contend that Microsofts grading systems are discriminatory One filed last October seeks classaction status on behalf of blacks and women The suit states that the rating system permits managers who are predominantly white males to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit According to the lawsuit employees are rated on a fivepoint scale with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each score Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a stack ranking from most to least valuable Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called lifeboat discussions where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat Managers had no other clear criteria according to Christine Webber a lawyer at Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll who is representing the employees Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft according to Peter M Browne a former executive who is also suing the company charging discrimination Mr Browne who is black said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve for example in deciding which ones would not receive stock options You werent told anything just meet the curve Mr Browne said He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized People gravitate to people who are like them and the system just forces that he said Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers said Deborah Willingham senior vice president for human resources adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment Employees can appeal their ratings for example and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated Ms Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score We dont force that curve to look any certain way she said Microsoft has no formal stack rank policy she said And when managers do have lifeboat discussions they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again While the company would not comment on the lawsuits Microsoft expressly prohibits discrimination Ms Willingham said Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford It argues that the companys new grading system discriminates against older workers The company which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago gives its managers A B or C grades Last year the company awarded percent an A percent a B and percent a C Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its gradingIt would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory a company spokeswoman said We are in a very competitive industry and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be At Conoco employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in based on a ranking from one to four according to a lawsuit filed last year The majority of those let go were Americans according to the suit as opposed to British Norwegian and Canadian professionals The rating system was selectively enforced and there were instances of manipulation said John Zavitsanos the lawyer representing the workers Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four Conoco based in Houston has extensive operations in the North Sea and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British according to Mr Zavitsanos While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation it said its evaluations were based on several factors including performance skills and expertise The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities Companies do need something in making pay decisions downsizing decisions said Jim Kochanski a consultant with Nextera Enterprises The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked They can get it very wrong he said businessGRADhtmlexDeiD enDe ac Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage

certain percentage permitted to receive each score Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given a stack ranking from most to least valuable Managers decide those rankings largely using what are called lifeboat discussions where they choose which employees they would want with them if stuck in a lifeboat Managers had no other clear criteria according to Christine Webber a lawyer at Cohen Milstein Hausfeld Toll who is representing the employees Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft according to Peter M Browne a former executive who is also suing the company charging discrimination Mr Browne who is black said managers were forced to use a curve in evaluating even small groups He said he had to rate a group of five on a curve for example in deciding which ones would not receive stock options You werent told anything just meet the curve Mr Browne said He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they socialized People gravitate to people who are like them and the system just forces that he said Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful We want to give the highest compensation to the very top performers said Deborah Willingham senior vice president for human resources adding that the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment Employees can appeal their ratings for example and are largely responsible for developing the criteria by which they are evaluated Ms Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score We dont force that curve to look any certain way she said Microsoft has no formal stack rank policy she said And when managers do have lifeboat discussions they are a tool to consider which employees they would want to keep if they were starting again While the company would not comment on the lawsuits Microsoft expressly prohibits discrimination Ms Willingham said Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against Ford It argues that the companys new grading system discriminates against older workers The company which adopted what it calls its performance management process a year ago gives its managers A B or C grades Last year the company awarded percent an A percent a B and percent a C Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly discriminated against older white males in its gradingIt would not comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades We believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory a company spokeswoman said We are in a very competitive industry and we need all of our employees to be the best they can be At Conoco employees contend that the company discriminated against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a dozen geophysicists and other scientists in based on a ranking from one to four according to a lawsuit filed last year The majority of those let go were Americans according to the suit as opposed to British Norwegian and Canadian professionals The rating system was selectively enforced and there were instances of manipulation said John Zavitsanos the lawyer representing the workers Even though some were given higher ratings on earlier rankings they were eventually given the lowest possible rating of four Conoco based in Houston has extensive operations in the North Sea and many of the senior managers at the division in question are British according to Mr Zavitsanos While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation it said its evaluations were based on several factors including performance skills and expertise The company said ratings often changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated in larger groups Conoco company also denied that decisions were based on anything other than individual capabilities Companies do need something in making pay decisions downsizing decisions said Jim Kochanski a consultant with Nextera Enterprises The problem is that companies may not take enough care in deciding how people should be ranked They can get it very wrong he said businessGRADhtmlexDeiD enDe ac Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most authoritative news coverage
