Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

a firesale price but if the price is fair we are sellers It is a tough message to deliver but people need to hear the truth I appreciate your efforts in arranging the floor meeting Any news on Eco Original Message From Mahan Mariella SentThursday November PM ToHorton Stanley SubjectRE Confidential Decision tree on projects Hi Stan I am sorry this took so long to reply to but I was out of the office yester day with my little one on a field trip Here is the feedback combined with my own appreciation of how people feel and some very humble suggestions that I hope will help During the EGAS session people felt very good about being able to air out their concerns and about getting official information as to the proposed merger and implications on the company Some times even if no new informa tion is provided people simply feel better because an effort is made to co mmunicate with them People appreciated your openness and the frankness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security On the other hand people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be dev eloped for key individuals They read that if they didnt get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key Perhaps bluntly that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the definition of key individual People like to feel important noncore is for them nonimportant an d absent that they worry about every little thing many of these no one ca n help or mitigate Finally people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold ie approx years and under stood and felt better that no fire sale will take place My biggest recommendations are We need to keep up our communication efforts people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate Pete and I and other s need to work on communicating further with each of our teams and on m otivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to update people as often as possible We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be ef fective about retention efforts my own view is that you start with the fi eld those are your most critical individuals because they are running t he asset We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good th ing and that it is not simply another life bought out by Enron ie man y people felt and still feel that there is still a chance Enron might ma ke on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal this may be more hope than belief but that is the case A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as t hough we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets There is no longer the attitude or position that if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow then whats the hurry The message today and forgive me if I misread it was we will put together a corp development group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performi ng assets cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us Mariella Original Message From Horton Stanley SentWednesday November AM ToMahan Mariella SubjectRE Confidential Decision tree on projects We will discuss at the next Staff meeting Thanks for bringing it up Any feedback from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated Original Message From Mahan Mariella SentTuesday November PM ToHorton Stanley Hughes James A Hayslett Rod Sommers Jeffrey E SubjectConfidential Decision tree on projects Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations these are SECLP Panama and Gaz a In the past as I suppose we have done in Dabhol we have taken the pos ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans SECLP has be en the biggest issueproblem Panama is much less a few million of floati ng of our receivables from the company would be sufficient to meet the cas h crunch in April of this year Note that in Panama the debt is fully gu aranteed by the government and is nonrecoursed to the operating company B LM In the past we have discussed letting the debt default which would c ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th e GoPanama The reason the vast majority of BLMs problems stem from acti ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPAs with pri vate parties those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues which although today have stopped or have been limited have left a mark on th e companys liquidity position Now the question is come April of should any of our actions in Panam a or decisions related thereto which we would have otherwise taken or made be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro n to preserve efforts to reestablish investorcreditor confidence The sa me could go for SECLP and Gaza This is simply an overall guidance question Lets take it up during our staff meeting next week if thats ok with you Many thanks Mariella,horton-s,President

A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want

A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values

glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant

important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President

A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect

Original Message From Mahan Mariella SentThursday November PM ToHorton Stanley SubjectRE Confidential Decision tree on projects Hi Stan I am sorry this took so long to reply to but I was out of the office yester day with my little one on a field trip Here is the feedback combined with my own appreciation of how people feel and some very humble suggestions that I hope will help During the EGAS session people felt very good about being able to air out their concerns and about getting official information as to the proposed merger and implications on the company Some times even if no new informa tion is provided people simply feel better because an effort is made to co mmunicate with them People appreciated your openness and the frankness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security On the other hand people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be dev eloped for key individuals They read that if they didnt get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key Perhaps bluntly that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the definition of key individual People like to feel important noncore is for them nonimportant an d absent that they worry about every little thing many of these no one ca n help or mitigate Finally people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold ie approx years and under stood and felt better that no fire sale will take place My biggest recommendations are We need to keep up our communication efforts people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate Pete and I and other s need to work on communicating further with each of our teams and on m otivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to update people as often as possible We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be ef fective about retention efforts my own view is that you start with the fi eld those are your most critical individuals because they are running t he asset We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good th ing and that it is not simply another life bought out by Enron ie man y people felt and still feel that there is still a chance Enron might ma ke on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal this may be more hope than belief but that is the case A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as t hough we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets There is no longer the attitude or position that if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow then whats the hurry The message today and forgive me if I misread it was we will put together a corp development group that will be focused on selling

from the floor meeting yesterday would be appreciated Original Message From Mahan Mariella SentTuesday November PM ToHorton Stanley Hughes James A Hayslett Rod Sommers Jeffrey E SubjectConfidential Decision tree on projects Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations these are SECLP Panama and Gaz a In the past as I suppose we have done in Dabhol we have taken the pos ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans SECLP has be en the biggest issueproblem Panama is much less a few million of floati ng of our receivables from the company would be sufficient to meet the cas h crunch in April of this year Note that in Panama the debt is fully gu aranteed by the government and is nonrecoursed to the operating company B LM In the past we have discussed letting the debt default which would c ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th e GoPanama The reason the vast majority of BLMs problems stem from acti ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPAs with pri vate parties those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues which although today have stopped or have been limited have left a mark on th e companys liquidity position Now the question is come April of should any of our actions in Panam a or decisions related thereto which we would have otherwise taken or made be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro n to preserve efforts to reestablish investorcreditor confidence The sa me could go for SECLP and Gaza This is simply an overall guidance question Lets take it up during our staff meeting next week if thats ok with you Many thanks Mariella,horton-s,President

Coover Cliff Collins Chris Robison Betty Binford Ann Tom cc Subject Fw Thought you would enjoy this Love Clara Original Message From maggie welsh To UndisclosedRecipientunidialcom Sent Thursday May PM A time comes in your life when you finally get it When in the midst of all your fears and insanity you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice inside your head cries out ENOUGH Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum your sobs begin to subside you shudder once or twice you blink back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you begin to look at the world through new eyes This is your awakening You realize that its time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness safety and security to come galloping over the next horizon You come to terms with the fact that he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella and that in the real world there arent always fairy tale endings or beginnings for that matter and that any guarantee of happily ever after must begin with you and in the process a sense of serenity is born of acceptance You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love appreciate or approve of who or what you are and thats OKThey are entitled to their own views and opinions And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself and in the process a sense of newly found confidence is born of selfapproval You stop bitching and blaming other people for the things they did to you or didnt do for you and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected You learn that people dont always say what they mean or mean what they say and that not everyone will always be there for you and that its not always about you So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself and in the process a sense of safety security is born of selfreliance You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and to overlook their shortcomings and human frailties and in the process a sense of peace contentment is born of forgiveness You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche And you begin to sift through all the crap youve been fed about how you should behave how you should look how much you shouldnt weigh what you should wear where you should shop what you should drive how and where you should live what you should do for a living who you should sleep with who you should marry what you should expect of a marriage the importance of having and raising children or what you owe your parents You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for You learn the difference between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values youve outgrown or should never have bought into to begin with and in the process you learn to respect your instincts You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive And that there is power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a consumer looking for your next fix You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not the outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life You learn that you dont know everything its not your job to save the world and that you cant teach a pig to sing You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake Then you learn about love romantic love and familial love You learn that you will not be more beautiful more intelligent more lovable or important because of the man or woman on your arm or the child that bears your name You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be You stop trying to control people situations and outcomes You learn that just as people grow and change so it is with love and you learn that love is a verb it is action And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the fact that you will never be a size or a perfect and you stop trying to compete with the image inside your head and agonizing over how you stack up You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love kindness sensitivity and respect and you will not settle for less And you allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you to glorify you with his or her touch and in the process you internalize the meaning of selfrespect And you learn that your body really is your temple You begin eating a balanced diet drinking more water and taking more time to exercise You learn that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create doubt and fear so you take more time to rest And just as food fuels the body laughter fuels the soul so you take more time to laugh and to play You learn that for the most part in life you get what you believe you deserve and that much of life truly is a selffulfilling prophecy You learn that anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working toward making it happen More importantly you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction discipline and perseverance You also learn that no one can do it all alone and that its OK to risk asking for help You learn that the only thing you must truly fear is the great robber baron of all time FEAR itself You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your terms And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom You learn that life isnt always fair you dont always get what you think you deserve and that sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting good people On these occasions you learn not to personalize things You learn that God isnt punishing you or failing to answer your prayers Its just life happening And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state the ego You learn that feelings such as anger envy and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about a full refrigerator clean running water a soft warm bed a long hot shower Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you try to make yourself a promise to never betray yourself And you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind And you make it a point to keep smiling to keep trusting and to stay open to every wonderful possibility Finally with courage in your heart and with God by your side you take a stand you take a deep breath and you begin to design the life you want to live as best as you can Fly fly do not fear Dont waste a breath dont shed a tear Your heart is pure your soul is free Be on your way dont wait for me Above the universe youll climb On beyond the hands of time The moon will rise the sun will set But I wont forget ,horton-s,President
