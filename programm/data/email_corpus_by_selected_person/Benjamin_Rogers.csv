Enron NA Office of the Chairman AM To All Enron North America cc Subject Organizational Changes To Enron North America Corp From Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July as part of the Enron North America ENA reorganization the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including accelerate the development of our people significantly expand our customer network and associated markets and accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups both within ENA and across Enron Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering One Enron we would like to announce th e following organizational changes in the CoverageOrigination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA CoverageOrigination To ensure a consistent strategy the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses the following coverageorigination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey a power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops energy service companies and IPPs b the Downstream CoverageOrigination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper chemicals plastics refined products metals an d mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western US Midstream Coverage Origination groups which focus on energy finance and industries Downstream CoverageOrigination As energy deregulation continues in North America it is becoming clear tha t the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp Further it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp Against this backdrop the Downstream CoverageOrigination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENAs existing ener gy commodities energy services finance assets and pulp and paper capabiliti es but also EESs energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuels chemic als plastics and refined products risk management capability These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business Under Gregs leadership the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three subgroups given the nature of these industries and our product offering a Pulp and Paper Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business This group will be responsible f or the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio n of paper risk management products b Chemicals Plastics and Refined Products We have asked Jim Ajello t o lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries c NonIntegrated Industrials Bruce Garner formerly leader of Bankers Trusts global metals and mining group in London has joined ENA to lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for t he provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textile s and glass manufacturing industries Midstream CoverageOrigination a Eastern CoverageOrigination This group activities will focus o n energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi s group b Western CoverageOrigination This groups activities will focus on energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the WSCC The y will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities QF restructuring opportunities in the Western US We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort s c IPP Merchant CoverageOrigination This groups activities will f ocus on the provision of structured energy finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolios of merc hant power generation either through development or acquisition We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group In addition Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect d Eastern QF Restructuring This group will focus on the QF restructur ing opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and recapitalization of the East Coast Power assets We hav e asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business Greg Blair formerly of Enron Asias development group Doug Clifford formerly of Citizens power and Dick Lydecker formerly of Cogen Technology will join this newly formed business Commercial Transactions The Commercial Transactions Group CTG coheaded by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA and thereby improve ENAs efficiency in ex ecuting transactions and freeup the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage CTG consists of six primary functions Transaction Development Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management Commodity Structuring and Transportation Transactional SupportAccounting Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator The function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western CoverageOrigination Groups The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons George McCormick Erin Norris and Russ Porter Billy Lemmons joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENAs industr ial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper Petrochemicals and Refining Environmental Energy Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm Jay Boudreaux Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups The seni or members of this team include Thomas Suffield Andy Kelemen Kelly Mahmoud a nd John House Thomas Suffield joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance Coal and Gas Assets groups The senior members of this team inclu de Brad Dunn John Curtin and Chris Hilgert We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua l responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group The remaining four groups within CTG will remai n largely unchanged In addition the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag e and industry knowledge in all ENAs markets particularly in the industri al markets It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe en the CoverageOrigination Groups and the CTG Groups Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor th America by working with us to implement these changes,rogers-b,Employee

Enron NA Office of the Chairman AM To All Enron North America cc Subject Organizational Changes To Enron North America Corp From Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July as part of the Enron North America ENA reorganization the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including accelerate the development of our people significantly expand our customer network and associated markets and accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups both within ENA and across Enron Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering One Enron we would like to announce th e following organizational changes in the CoverageOrigination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA CoverageOrigination To ensure a consistent strategy the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses the following coverageorigination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey a power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops energy service companies and IPPs b the Downstream CoverageOrigination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper chemicals plastics refined products metals an d mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western US Midstream Coverage Origination groups which focus on energy finance and industries Downstream CoverageOrigination As energy deregulation continues in North America it is becoming clear tha t the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp Further it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp Against this backdrop the Downstream CoverageOrigination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENAs existing ener gy commodities energy services finance assets and pulp and paper capabiliti es but also EESs energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuels chemic als plastics and refined products risk management capability These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business Under Gregs leadership the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three subgroups given the nature of these industries and our product offering a Pulp and Paper Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business This group will be responsible f or the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio n of paper risk management products b Chemicals Plastics and Refined Products We have asked Jim Ajello t o lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries c NonIntegrated Industrials Bruce Garner formerly leader of Bankers Trusts global metals and mining group in London has joined ENA to lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for t he provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textile s and glass manufacturing industries Midstream CoverageOrigination a Eastern CoverageOrigination This group activities will focus o n energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi s group b Western CoverageOrigination This groups activities will focus on energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the WSCC The y will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities QF restructuring opportunities in the Western US We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort s c IPP Merchant CoverageOrigination This groups activities will f ocus on the provision of structured energy finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolios of merc hant power generation either through development or acquisition We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group In addition Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect d Eastern QF Restructuring This group will focus on the QF restructur ing opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and recapitalization of the East Coast Power assets We hav e asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business Greg Blair formerly of Enron Asias development group Doug Clifford formerly of Citizens power and Dick Lydecker formerly of Cogen Technology will join this newly formed business Commercial Transactions The Commercial Transactions Group CTG coheaded by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA and thereby improve ENAs efficiency in ex ecuting transactions and freeup the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage CTG consists of six primary functions Transaction Development Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management Commodity Structuring and Transportation Transactional SupportAccounting Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator The function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western CoverageOrigination Groups The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons George McCormick Erin Norris and Russ Porter Billy Lemmons joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENAs industr ial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper Petrochemicals and Refining Environmental Energy Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm Jay Boudreaux Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups The seni or members of this team include Thomas Suffield Andy Kelemen Kelly Mahmoud a nd John House Thomas Suffield joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance Coal and Gas Assets groups The senior members of this team inclu de Brad Dunn John Curtin and Chris Hilgert We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua l responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group The remaining four groups within CTG will remai n largely unchanged In addition the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag e and industry knowledge in all ENAs markets particularly in the industri al markets It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe en the CoverageOrigination Groups and the CTG Groups Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor th America by working with us to implement these changes,rogers-b,Employee

Enron NA Office of the Chairman AM To All Enron North America cc Subject Organizational Changes To Enron North America Corp From Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July as part of the Enron North America ENA reorganization the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including accelerate the development of our people significantly expand our customer network and associated markets and accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups both within ENA and across Enron Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering One Enron we would like to announce th e following organizational changes in the CoverageOrigination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA CoverageOrigination To ensure a consistent strategy the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses the following coverageorigination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey a power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops energy service companies and IPPs b the Downstream CoverageOrigination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper chemicals plastics refined products metals an d mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western US Midstream Coverage Origination groups which focus on energy finance and industries Downstream CoverageOrigination As energy deregulation continues in North America it is becoming clear tha t the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp Further it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp Against this backdrop the Downstream CoverageOrigination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENAs existing ener gy commodities energy services finance assets and pulp and paper capabiliti es but also EESs energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuels chemic als plastics and refined products risk management capability These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business Under Gregs leadership the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three subgroups given the nature of these industries and our product offering a Pulp and Paper Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business This group will be responsible f or the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio n of paper risk management products b Chemicals Plastics and Refined Products We have asked Jim Ajello t o lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries c NonIntegrated Industrials Bruce Garner formerly leader of Bankers Trusts global metals and mining group in London has joined ENA to lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for t he provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textile s and glass manufacturing industries Midstream CoverageOrigination a Eastern CoverageOrigination This group activities will focus o n energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi s group b Western CoverageOrigination This groups activities will focus on energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the WSCC The y will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities QF restructuring opportunities in the Western US We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort s c IPP Merchant CoverageOrigination This groups activities will f ocus on the provision of structured energy finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolios of merc hant power generation either through development or acquisition We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group In addition Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect d Eastern QF Restructuring This group will focus on the QF restructur ing opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and recapitalization of the East Coast Power assets We hav e asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business Greg Blair formerly of Enron Asias development group Doug Clifford formerly of Citizens power and Dick Lydecker formerly of Cogen Technology will join this newly formed business Commercial Transactions The Commercial Transactions Group CTG coheaded by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA and thereby improve ENAs efficiency in ex ecuting transactions and freeup the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage CTG consists of six primary functions Transaction Development Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management Commodity Structuring and Transportation Transactional SupportAccounting Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator The function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western CoverageOrigination Groups The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons George McCormick Erin Norris and Russ Porter Billy Lemmons joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENAs industr ial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper Petrochemicals and Refining Environmental Energy Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm Jay Boudreaux Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups The seni or members of this team include Thomas Suffield Andy Kelemen Kelly Mahmoud a nd John House Thomas Suffield joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance Coal and Gas Assets groups The senior members of this team inclu de Brad Dunn John Curtin and Chris Hilgert We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua l responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group The remaining four groups within CTG will remai n largely unchanged In addition the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag e and industry knowledge in all ENAs markets particularly in the industri al markets It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe en the CoverageOrigination Groups and the CTG Groups Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor th America by working with us to implement these changes,rogers-b,Employee

To Rogers Benjamin Subject FW Comments on the Status of ENE sh Original Message From John Gualy ENRON Sent Friday October AM To Gualy Jaime Subject FW Comments on the Status of ENE sh Authored by Jeff Dietert OUR VIEW ENE is down huge for the year and trading at only xFY and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock More pressure is likely today on the news of SP revising its longterm ratings outlook to negative based on the decline in market capitalization and ENEs additional draw on its credit facilities which does not change its net debt but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating which could break covenants and restrict liquidity We believe the major issues are managements ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans and ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the writedown in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book IF ENE management does not stepup to calm investor fears these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive the stock down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counterparties to reduce exposure with ENE limiting ENEs to generate earnings and cash flow Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock Ifwhen ENE schedules a conference call or road show we would consider this a bullish sign Absent further clarification the stock is likely to continue to be weak Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that longterm investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to sh over the next to month period rather than breakup value shsee below We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery ENEs VIEW ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate MM charge expected in Q due to an accounting change With no further asset writedowns and roughly MM in asset divestitures MM India EP MM Puerto Rico power plant and MM Brazilian power plant in Q ENEs DTC ratio is likely to decline from at the end of Q to roughly at the end of the year After the close of the Portland General divestiture expected by yearend we expect its DTC to fall below we are projecting FCF to be breakeven in FY We estimate that ENEs interest coverage at the end of Q is x ENE is currently rated BBB by SP and Baa by Moodys and would need to decline ratings to fall below investment grade For comparison purposes SPs BBB median DTC is and EBITDAInt Exp coverage is x while BB noninvestment grade median DTC is and interest coverage is x IMPORTANCE OF ENEs INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING We believe that ENEs Wholesale segments which generates of its EBIT would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade In addition a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of MM shares of common stock and B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENEs offbalance sheet structured financing vehicles We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an investment grade rating Moodys has its BBB rating under review for a possible downgrade Last night SP revised its longterm ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the companys financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet BREAKUP VALUE We believe ENE s Wholesale America B in TTM EBITDA Wholesale Europe MM and Retail MM segments are conservatively worth a x multiple recent multiples have been higher but we are discounting due to limited buying interest or B The Gas Pipeline segment MM and Global Assets MM valued at a x multiple are worth B PGE valued at the divestiture price is B Total asset value is conservatively B vs debt of B leaving B or sh for equity investors in a breakup scenario The challenge is if ENE loses its investment grade rating the value B of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromisedleaving little for equity investors POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ENEs Global Assets portfolio includes assets with B in book value ENEs total gross PPE is B that has generated an EBIT loss of MM EBITDA of MM over the last month period Q to Q The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro an electric utility in Brazil Dabhol power plant in India TGS a natural gas pipeline in Argentina Azurix and Enron Wind operations These assets seem ripe for a writedown although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired The writedown of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENEs DTC threatening its credit rating It is not clear that ENE put all its underperforming assets in the Global Assets portfolio There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS ENEs counterparties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have overreacted Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENEs financial strategy hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street THE SEC INQUIRY We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated We do not expect the SEC to find any legal wrongdoingalthough this doesnt mean that they wont express qualitative concern

Enron NA Office of the Chairman AM To All Enron North America cc Subject Organizational Changes To Enron North America Corp From Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon In July as part of the Enron North America ENA reorganization the implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the continued growth of ENA including accelerate the development of our people significantly expand our customer network and associated markets and accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups both within ENA and across Enron Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal of fostering One Enron we would like to announce th e following organizational changes in the CoverageOrigination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Group within ENA CoverageOrigination To ensure a consistent strategy the free flowing of resources and product technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses the following coverageorigination groups will be consolidated under the leadership of Dave Delainey a power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops energy service companies and IPPs b the Downstream CoverageOrigination groups which focus on delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers including pulp and paper chemicals plastics refined products metals an d mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western US Midstream Coverage Origination groups which focus on energy finance and industries Downstream CoverageOrigination As energy deregulation continues in North America it is becoming clear tha t the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and Enron Corp Further it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp Against this backdrop the Downstream CoverageOrigination function will expand its product offering to include not only ENAs existing ener gy commodities energy services finance assets and pulp and paper capabiliti es but also EESs energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuels chemic als plastics and refined products risk management capability These additional capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative Greg Piper will be returning from Portland to manage this business Under Gregs leadership the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three subgroups given the nature of these industries and our product offering a Pulp and Paper Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business This group will be responsible f or the provision of innovative products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio n of paper risk management products b Chemicals Plastics and Refined Products We have asked Jim Ajello t o lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the chemicals and refined products industries c NonIntegrated Industrials Bruce Garner formerly leader of Bankers Trusts global metals and mining group in London has joined ENA to lead the coverage activities in this business This group will be responsible for t he provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining heavy manufacturing industrial gases fertilizers transportation textile s and glass manufacturing industries Midstream CoverageOrigination a Eastern CoverageOrigination This group activities will focus o n energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the Eastern Interconnect We have asked Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi s group b Western CoverageOrigination This groups activities will focus on energy finance and power development solutions for electric and gas utilities municipals coops and energy service companies in the WSCC The y will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities QF restructuring opportunities in the Western US We have asked Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group Chris will relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort s c IPP Merchant CoverageOrigination This groups activities will f ocus on the provision of structured energy finance and asset solutions for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolios of merc hant power generation either through development or acquisition We have asked Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group In addition Mike will continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern Interconnect d Eastern QF Restructuring This group will focus on the QF restructur ing opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing restructuring and recapitalization of the East Coast Power assets We hav e asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business Greg Blair formerly of Enron Asias development group Doug Clifford formerly of Citizens power and Dick Lydecker formerly of Cogen Technology will join this newly formed business Commercial Transactions The Commercial Transactions Group CTG coheaded by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of transactions within ENA and thereby improve ENAs efficiency in ex ecuting transactions and freeup the origination groups to increase their intensity of client coverage CTG consists of six primary functions Transaction Development Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management Commodity Structuring and Transportation Transactional SupportAccounting Technical Analysis and Upstream Asset Management The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with the originator The function will be divided into four teams each of which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups This dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link better service and greater accountability with the origination groups however the CTG resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value transactions across the coverage functions a Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and Western CoverageOrigination Groups The senior members of this group include Billy Lemmons George McCormick Erin Norris and Russ Porter Billy Lemmons joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES Russ Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power origination b Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENAs industr ial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper Petrochemicals and Refining Environmental Energy Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is established The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm Jay Boudreaux Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks c Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups The seni or members of this team include Thomas Suffield Andy Kelemen Kelly Mahmoud a nd John House Thomas Suffield joined Enron in Most recently he was the VicePresident of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix We anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few weeks d Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer Finance Coal and Gas Assets groups The senior members of this team inclu de Brad Dunn John Curtin and Chris Hilgert We hope to announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams Andrea Reed will continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management all junior commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua l responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the Capital Structuring Group The remaining four groups within CTG will remai n largely unchanged In addition the Origination and the Transaction Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located together We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag e and industry knowledge in all ENAs markets particularly in the industri al markets It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe en the CoverageOrigination Groups and the CTG Groups Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor th America by working with us to implement these changes,rogers-b,Employee
