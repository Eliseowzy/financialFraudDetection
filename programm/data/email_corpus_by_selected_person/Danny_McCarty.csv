Sent Wednesday November PM To DLGAallenronworldwide Subject Overview of Investor Conference Call Today Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings In connection with the proposed transactions Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statementprospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio n Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro xy statementprospectus regarding the proposed

CcCentilli James SubjectRE Redfield Deliverability Project Rod Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei r original levels The work overs are planned over a year period and a re expected to have a lasting effect of at least years The cost to mod el and rework these wells is estimated to be MM A test program would be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing the program at a cost of If the test program did not prove out t he project would be terminated at this point The original proposal was to treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred Bob Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment This would result as Kent ha s indicated negative EBIT for the first years As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into a year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f ield Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s pend an additional MM on a total of well workovers in the first y ears of the contract NNG currently budgets per year for Redfield well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability Operations has c ommitted per year in well maintenance over the next years to thi s project for a total of MM Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer but has indicated that they would require a to return for assuming the financing Hallibu rton indicated that this is a nonstandard deal for them and that is the re ason for high return requirement The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third party at a more

looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term project that has negative short term cash flow We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen ts

great from a long term s tandpoint Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte d Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec onomics and have shown that the project has a great return in excess of Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all OM expenses

negative IBIT flow in the first years however Halliburton has not been in terested and has proposed a finance charge for this structure What would be the appetite for possibly prepaying a majority of
