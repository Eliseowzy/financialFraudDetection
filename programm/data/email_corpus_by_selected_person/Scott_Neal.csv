CERA Alert Sent Mon October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of October For November the differential is expected to average US for a resulti ng AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX Va July PRNewswire Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies Columbia Gas Transmission a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive Internetbased pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbias current open auction process In a first of its kind filing Columbia proposes a bidoffer system for selling capacity similar to online natural gas commodity trading systems The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERCs Order which encourages companies to voluntarily submit new and innovative approaches to capacity auctions Since the filing is not required under Order Columbias proposed auction is separate from Columbias Order compliance filing made June Under the current mechanism capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it said Carl Levander vicepresident of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a fiveday period parties often wait until the last minutes to place a bid Also since the current process is based on set time periods customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid According to Levander Columbias proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced Internetbased interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorterterm contracts Under Columbias proposed bidoffer system Columbia would offer via its electronic bulletin board sales terms for all its available firm capacity Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding If Columbia offers discounted capacity the customer can counteroffer with a different rate Or if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity then a customer can counteroffer with a different term length Columbia can match the highest bid subject to a present value process and the sale is immediate and binding At any time before a binding sale the customer can change or withdraw its bid Columbias bidoffer auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERCs Order Columbias auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at am EST and all available capacity will be posted prior to am EST The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non discriminatory basis The auction is userfriendly since it will use Columbias existing EBB format All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available As is Columbias current practice winning bids and the bidders identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids without the bidders identity will be available for review to all bidders through an Internetbased system We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is transparent verifiable and nondiscriminatory to all parties as well as innovative in design Levander said Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commissions principles it is based on feedback gathered from customers who expressed a desire for transparent market information shorter auction periods an ability to withdraw and change bids and a realtime immediate closure process Columbia Gas Transmission with offices in Charleston WVa and Fairfax Va moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a mile pipeline network which reaches across Midwestern Northeastern and midAtlantic states The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over billion cubic feet Bcf of working capacity Columbia Energy Group based in Herndon Va is one of the nations leading energy services companies with assets of approximately billion

CERA Alert Sent Mon October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat

levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX Va July PRNewswire Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies Columbia Gas Transmission a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive Internetbased pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbias current open auction process In a first of its kind filing Columbia proposes a bidoffer system for selling capacity similar to online natural gas commodity trading systems The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERCs Order which encourages companies to voluntarily submit new and innovative approaches to capacity auctions Since the filing is not required under Order Columbias proposed auction is separate from Columbias Order compliance filing made June Under the current mechanism capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it said Carl Levander vicepresident of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a fiveday period parties often wait until the last minutes to place a bid Also since the current process is based on set time periods customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid According to Levander Columbias proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced Internetbased interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorterterm contracts Under Columbias proposed bidoffer system Columbia would offer via its electronic bulletin board sales terms for all its available firm capacity Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding If Columbia offers discounted capacity the customer can counteroffer with a different rate Or if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity then a customer can counteroffer with a different term length Columbia can match the highest bid subject to a present value process and the sale is immediate and binding At any time before a binding sale the customer can change or withdraw its bid Columbias bidoffer auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERCs Order Columbias auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at am EST and all available capacity will be posted prior to am EST The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non discriminatory basis The auction is userfriendly since it will use Columbias existing EBB format All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available As is Columbias current practice winning bids and the bidders identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids without the bidders identity will be available for review to all bidders through an Internetbased system We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is transparent verifiable and nondiscriminatory to all parties as well as innovative in design Levander said Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commissions principles it is based on feedback gathered from customers who expressed a desire for transparent market information shorter auction periods an ability to withdraw and change bids and a realtime immediate closure process Columbia Gas Transmission with offices in Charleston WVa and Fairfax Va moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a mile pipeline network which reaches across Midwestern Northeastern and midAtlantic states The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over billion cubic feet Bcf of working capacity Columbia Energy Group based in Herndon Va is one of the nations leading energy services companies with assets of approximately billion

To Janet R CT Thomas A CT Scott CT cc Subject Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat CERA Alert Forwarded by Doug LeachHOUECT on AM on PM To cc Subject Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat CERA Alert CERA Alert Sent Mon October Title Monthly Briefing Turning on the Heat Author N American Gas Team EMail Category Alert Product Line North American Gas URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmuDmD Alternative URL clientnagaltnagaltabhtml The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la st week From midSeptember through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet Bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market somewhat Henry Hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil Last week however tragedy in the Middle East and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem ber Henry Hub prices up by more than in two days to above Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but CERA does not expect the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX Va July PRNewswire Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies Columbia Gas Transmission a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive Internetbased pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbias current open auction process In a first of its kind filing Columbia proposes a bidoffer system for selling capacity similar to online natural gas commodity trading systems The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERCs Order which encourages companies to voluntarily submit new and innovative approaches to capacity auctions Since the filing is not required under Order Columbias proposed auction is separate from Columbias Order compliance filing made June Under the current mechanism capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it said Carl Levander vicepresident of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a fiveday period parties often wait until the last minutes to place a bid Also since the current process is based on set time periods customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid According to Levander Columbias proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced Internetbased interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorterterm contracts Under Columbias proposed bidoffer system Columbia would offer via its electronic bulletin board sales terms for all its available firm capacity Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding If Columbia offers discounted capacity the customer can counteroffer with a different rate Or if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity then a customer can counteroffer with a different term length Columbia can match the highest bid subject to a present value process and the sale is immediate and binding At any time before a binding sale the customer can change or withdraw its bid Columbias bidoffer auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERCs Order Columbias auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at am EST and all available capacity will be posted prior to am EST The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non discriminatory basis The auction is userfriendly since it will use Columbias existing EBB format All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available As is Columbias current practice winning bids and the bidders identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids without the bidders identity will be available for review to all bidders through an Internetbased system We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is transparent verifiable and nondiscriminatory to all parties as well as innovative in design Levander said Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commissions principles it is based on feedback gathered from customers who expressed a desire for transparent market information shorter auction periods an ability to withdraw and change bids and a realtime immediate closure process Columbia Gas Transmission with offices in Charleston WVa and Fairfax Va moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a mile pipeline network which reaches across Midwestern Northeastern and midAtlantic states The company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over billion cubic feet Bcf of working capacity Columbia Energy Group based in Herndon Va is one of the nations leading energy services companies with assets of approximately billion

Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x,neal-s,Vice President

relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas market Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly Bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil Also weather must remain mil d through October or else US working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet Tcf by the end of the month The headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply Time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price As a result CERA expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging at the Henry Hub during November see Table More lucka great deal morewould be required to restore a measure of calm to the gas market Gas StorageThe Final Push October storage injections have varied historically from Bcf to approximately Bcf per day in the United States and this year CERA expects them to averag e Bcf per day a moderate level for the month see Table The reporting of injections of Bcf during the week ending October precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of October With the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofOctober inventory of Bcfmore tha n Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October CERA expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb er However normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h CERA estimates will average Bcf per day this year Withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March Low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b e priced out of the gas market and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel oil Regional MarketsWinter Rules The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way and the start of winter heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supplyri ch Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub Local demand for Rockies supply has also eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices and CERA expects differentials between both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November In t he Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter with the magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather The onset of flows on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe r see Table CERAs outlook by region follows Rockies Earlyseason cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry Hub differentials so far this month Ample supplies within the Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of October and early November depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per MMBtu summer level CERA expects a per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub during November San Juan The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting flows south out of the Rockies San Juan differentials should follow the same relationships as Rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through November CERA expects an average San Juan differential of per MMBtu for November Permian and MidContinent Tight relationships between the Permian Basin and MidContinent and the Henry Hub should continue through November with some slight widening in the MidContinent basis differential expected when Alliance flows commence CERA expects differentials of per MMBtu and per MMBtu respectively Chicago The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago citygate market However the demand rebound that would result from normal November weather this year would offset most of the added supplies As a result Chicago differentials will average in the per MMBtu range even when Alliance flows commence although delay of the Vector Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest CERA expects average November Chicago differentials of per MMBtu Northeast markets Normal weather would drive a substantial rebound in New York citygate prices from yearearlier levels but there is little added delivery capacity into that market CERA expects New York to price above the Henry Hub during November well above the current low o mids Canadian MarketsSupply Growth Still Uncertain The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are uncertain A line pack of between and Bcf has been established and modest flows of million cubic feet MMcf per day have been initiated to test and commissio n the pipeline The startup is still slated for November but the unknown quantities of gas that are flowing on a daytoday basis are making it difficult to asses s precisely the volume of supply being produced At this time it appears that October is on par with The current expectation is for over well completions in approximately of which are expected to be gas wells Even if the shallow trend does not change substantially the sheer number of wells is still expected to produce a supply build by yearend and into For the total western suppl y build is expected to be flat with to slightly negative increasing to positive growth of MMcf per day in Demand Slow but Exports Up TransCanada flows are still down averaging about MMcf per day less in October than the yearearlier levels Storage injections in the East have accelerated eastern inventories are expected to be above last years levels at the e nd of October Storage injections in the West however have dwindled revising the expect ed storage inventories to be even with the fiveyear average but below levels PGE GTNW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly below levels by MMcf per day in November as well Northern Bord er Pipeline is running about MMcf per day above October but is expecte d to be slightly below levels in November Coolerthannormal weather has push ed western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern Canadian demand High Prices Wide Differentials The AECOHenry differential has leveled off in the upper USs to low USs and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of October For November the differential is expected to average US for a resulti ng AECO average of C per gigajoule US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of

Columbia Gas Transmission Files Innovative Capacity Auction Process With FERC FAIRFAX Va July PRNewswire Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies Columbia Gas Transmission a wholly owned subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider an interactive Internetbased pipeline capacity auction process that enhances Columbias current open auction process In a first of its kind filing Columbia proposes a bidoffer system for selling capacity similar to online natural gas commodity trading systems The filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERCs Order which encourages companies to voluntarily submit new and innovative approaches to capacity auctions Since the filing is not required under Order Columbias proposed auction is separate from Columbias Order compliance filing made June Under the current mechanism capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it said Carl Levander vicepresident of Rates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a fiveday period parties often wait until the last minutes to place a bid Also since the current process is based on set time periods customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid According to Levander Columbias proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced Internetbased interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorterterm contracts Under Columbias proposed bidoffer system Columbia would offer via its electronic bulletin board sales terms for all its available firm capacity Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding If Columbia offers discounted capacity the customer can counteroffer with a different rate Or if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity then a customer can counteroffer with a different term length Columbia can match the highest bid subject to a present value process and the sale is immediate and binding At any time before a binding sale the customer can change or withdraw its bid Columbias bidoffer auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERCs Order Columbias auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at am EST and all available capacity will be posted prior to am EST The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non discriminatory basis The auction is userfriendly since it will use Columbias existing EBB format All information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the Internet The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available As is Columbias current practice winning bids and the bidders identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids without the bidders identity will be available for review to all bidders through an Internetbased system We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is transparent verifiable and nondiscriminatory to all parties as well as innovative in design Levander said Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commissions principles it is based on feedback gathered from customers who expressed a desire for transparent market information shorter auction periods an ability to withdraw and change bids and a realtime immediate closure process Columbia Gas Transmission with offices in Charleston WVa and Fairfax Va moves an average of three billion cubic feet of
