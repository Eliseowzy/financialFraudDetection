REQUIRED READING fwd Forwarded Message Who did it Foreign Report presents an alternative view Israels military intelligence service Aman suspects that Iraq is the state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington Directing the mission Aman officers believe were two of the worlds foremost terrorist masterminds the Lebanese Imad Mughniyeh head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah and the Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri senior member of AlQaeda and possible successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden The two men have not been seen for some time Mughniyeh is probably the worlds most wanted outlaw Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable Zawahiri is thought to be based in Egypt He could be Bin Ladens chief representative outside Afghanistan The Iraqis who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty work were quick to discover the advantages of AlQaeda The Israeli sources claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling between Baghdad and Afghanistan meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri According to the sources one of the Iraqi intelligence officers Salah Suleiman was captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad Mughniyeh Weve only got scraps of information not the full picture admits one intelligence source but it was good enough for us to send a warning six weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was expected One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany We believe that the operational brains behind the NewYork attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi Intelligence Service SSO Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before On April th he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest goal of any terrorist organisation until last week blowing up an Israeli ElAl airliner above Tel Aviv A man carrying a forged British passport with the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb he was supposed to take on board an ElAl flight leaving Israel when it accidentally went off Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but Lebanese and that his operation was supposed to be a special gift to Israel from Imad Mughniyeh A psychopath Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh says an Israeli who knows Mughniyeh The guy is a genius someone who refined the art of terrorism to its utmost level We studied him and reached the conclusion that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological reasons which we have given up trying to understand The killing of his two brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state behind the two terror masterminds In recent months there was a change and Iraq decided to get into the terror business On July th they tried for the first time to send a suicide bomber trained in Baghdad to blow up Tel Aviv airport Foreign Report No Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of this unprecedented terror operation However they believe the chief of the Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein the dictators son and his organisation is the most likely to have been involved Mughniyeh is a sick man says an intelligence officer who was in charge of his file He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the most dangerous active terrorist today He is wanted by several governments and the Americans have put a m reward on his head Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for NonSubscriber Extract It was the assassination of one man in March that is said to have made Mughniyeh the CIAs most wanted terrorist Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the head of the CIA station in Beirut William Buckley The kidnapping triggered what later became known as Irangate when the Americans tried to exchange Buckley and others with arms for Iran However the attempt ended in a fiasco By one unconfirmed account Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley with his own hands A year later in a combined CIAMossad operation a powerful car bomb went off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullahs spiritual leader Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah Seventyfive people were killed One of them was his brother Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad Mughniyeh hid in Iran In February Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the then head of Hizbullah Sheikh Abas Musawi in South Lebanon Musawi his wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later According to press reports Mughniyeh was called back into action and in a wellplanned and devastating attack his people blew up the Israeli embassy in Argentina The building was demolished and were killed Only last year after a long investigation did Argentina issue a warrant for Mughniyehs arrest The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December when a car bomb went off in a southern Shiite suburb of Beirut Four people were killed One of them was called Mughniyeh but to the deep disappointment of those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one Mughniyehs life was saved but his other brother Fuad was killed Mughniyeh waited for his opportunity for revenge Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyehs signature on the wreckage in New York and Washington How to counter this kind of terrorism To fight these bastards you dont need a military attack said an experienced Israeli commando officer You only need to adopt Israels assassination policy Some interesting facts and info Subject Whats the Plan Patterns of Global Terrorism Hello friends For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with all my heart family and friends are safe The victims will not be forgotten I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of what is to come Or perhaps Im ranting you decide My first reactions like many others were decimation selected occupation no more standing military slowly over the course of years we bring these nations into the fold of economic prosperity This has worked before but will it now On terrorism and intelligence I think terrorism is not to be treated as criminal law we cannot follow the diplomatic code when dealing with terrorist organizations ie our intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these people or have moles on the payroll After a few days of kill em all mentality I decided to begin my education in this matter I would like to share with you my first research and some impressions I do feel more informed My resolve is no different but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into something far more calculated Domestic and international terrorism has been a horrible problem for as long as most nations can remember There is on average more than one terrorist event a day in the world In the late s it was as high as events a day This is terrorism From Colin Powell himself I found myself numb before I event got through the first months of terrorrptindexhtml terrorrptindexhtml List of major terrorist organizations they will all need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first targets librarytgptgpndxhtm librarytgptgpndxhtm Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella organization for a worldwide network that includes many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad some members of alGamaat alIslamiyya the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Harakat ulMujahidin AlQaida an terrorist organization almost run by bin Laden financially his network is like a holding company Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the four organizations listed below Each of the other organizations in turn exerts influence over other terrorist groups Most of these are fundamental Islamic extremist organizations A fear is that a general cohesive theme is to overthrow the middleeastern governments establish fundamentalist Islamic states which would persecute other religious observers within their borders wage war on western influence internally and potentially engage in military actions against the United States and other western nations librarytgpqaidahtm librarytgpqaidahtm These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin Laden in calling for the death of Americans alJihad Egyptian Islamic JihadIslamic JihadJihad Group librarytgpjihadhtm librarytgpjihadhtm AlGamaa alIslamiyya Islamic Group killed Sedat has been terrorizing Egyptian government officials for years librarytgpalgamahtm librarytgpalgamahtm Harakat ulMujahidin HUM Sunni Muslim terrorists linked to Taliban and bin Laden located in Pakistan and the Kashmir province in India maintain organized terrorism against India and Hindu culture in the region librarytgphuahtm librarytgphuahtm Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan IMU Focused primarily on terrozing its bordering nations locally focused with aspirations for eliminating western influence unchecked this organization will grow into a world terror problem librarytgpimuhtm librarytgpimuhtm Travel Warnings from the Department of State I like these links for the oneliner view of the security conditions in these nations There is significant conflict and terrorism along the KyrgyzUzbek and KyrgyzTajik borders afghanistanhtml afghanistanhtml tajikistanhtml tajikistanhtml uzbekistanhtml uzbekistanhtml turkmenistanhtml turkmenistanhtml kyrgyzhtml kyrgyzhtml Geography very good idea to look at maps of the region I found the geography interesting to study in detail Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access The oceantoland access is through Pakistans Arabian Sea coast then head North miles to Peshawar and then into Kabul the mountainous route the British used in The Pakistan army is Taliban sympathetic Already political parties have issued statements of opposition to their own government for offering to help America They will descend into civil war most surely The HUM will likely be a significant part of that problem It will do us no good to partner with a cooperative government and an uncooperative military Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by renegades within their own army Things we should know In Pakistan many Afghan refugees were initially trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence ISI in the s to fight the Soviets They were called the Mujahideen Many were children living in refugee camps when recruited having known nothing else in this world Left to their own devices for years these camps and training centers have given root to terrorist organizations HUM and violently antihumanitarian fundamentalist movements the Taliban The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan in overthrowing the then ShiiteCommunist regime killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul for several days The Taliban are Sunni Muslim fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat they terrorize other Muslim communities the Hazaras and Hindu Kush people within their borders The Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan Hindus to wear identifications tags Sound familiar The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida bin Ladens organization bin Laden also influences the fundamentalist IMU in Uzbekistan The IMU is another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group they are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan Kyrgyzistan and Tajikistan north of Afghanistan The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the Pushtun region Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan There have been movements to create a separate Pushtunistan This map indicates the ethnic breakdown in the region mapsmiddleeastandasiapakistanethnicjpg mapsmiddleeastandasiapakistanethnicjpg And the HUM focuses their attacks on India The Shiite Muslims many other Sunni Muslims and in general the world muslim community do not agree with the Talibans interpretation of Islamic law The Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world because of their extreme harshness and treatment of women total eliminations of all modern culture and being the worlds largest heroin production The elimination of western influence is not considered a problem within some other fundamentalist groups Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to its West Iran is an Shia or Shiite Muslim nation Because Iran is predominantly Shia they are unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated Afghanistan Iran backs the ousted government and is angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of thousands of Shia Muslims including Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan Iran also has border disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a devastating year war Afghanistan and Iraq are both million people Iran is closer to million An exchange from regarding Iran and Afghanistan mandodopswarafghanhtm mandodopswarafghanhtm Also during the war with Soviet over MILLION land mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left behind Landmines Landmines The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern Military Alliance These people are also Sunni Muslim and ethnically are the Tajiks Their leader Massoud was killed last week assassinated by men posing as the press The sliver of Afghanistan they still control is the finger squeezed between northern Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban without initiating conflict with Tajikistan The NMA is a political authority that may be put in place They have offered soldiers and more on reserve Their leader was killed last week most likely in some coordinated effort along with the new requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need to put monies in to the Afghan bank Many acts were clearly coordinated in this event I have also been seeking out information on the Taliban in particular These link contain some very powerful information Quite frankly it is shameful that the Western world turned their back when this hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many years ago First a super high level overview it is

newsnewsbyteuswirestoryaspid newsnewsbyteuswirestoryaspid Try to digest this information it is very important that initiate an informed dialogue But the Taliban must go This section is organized geographically based on the waterways The nations in question will need to eradicate expel extremists from within their own borders This means partnering with a United States led coalition and contributing emphatically Look at the Mediterranean coast The South Morocco Algeria Libya and Egypt are all plagued by terrorism The East Israel Lebanon Syria all plagued by terrorist groups There is a dreadful rooting of terrorist organization Beirut was once a beautiful city I am told For years it has replaced Warsaw as the popculture reference to a war torn city Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS Look at the Red Sea EgyptSudan and Saudi Arabia The Sudan is terribly infiltrated this may be the terrorist plan hatching ground and safe haven And while the Saudis are economically partnered with the western world many extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these organizations Sudan is also suspected of being a meeting ground for the terrorist network Look at the Gulf of Aden entrance to the Red Sea Yemen has allowed bin Laden to broadcast site of the USS Cole bombing After the attack the perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates both acknowledge the Taliban government They have provided radical nationals to the Afghans throughout the years many support the Taliban some trained with bin Laden We hope these governments have a change of heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban Iran Persia until has coastal territory along the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north We have had problems with Iran in the past in the current situation they may be helpful maybe not There is information pointing to an Islamic conference in Tehran which is another possible hatching ground for these operations Iran still may be a very serious issue in the future It is a religious government something we all implicitly abhor in this nation They exiled the Shah and began systematically eliminating western influence from their society after the event in Iraq Part of the Ottoman empire through Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own nationals the Kurds in the North near the Turkish border As we know he has invaded Kuwait An year war with Iran over borders was going on at the same time the soviets were in Afghanistan This is a military regime Though the economic sanctions we have used for the last years have kept Iraq down as military force they have created a new generation of hatred East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea part of the Indian Ocean the Arabian basin is separated from the Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is nothing to prevent sea travel Pakistan a country on the verge of civil war A military regime Probably half of the people in the army are Taliban sympathizers Pakistan may be in civil war shortly India the largest democracy in the world Still disassembling the yr old Caste System The British occupation left India with an intact system of representative government They are plagued by internal strife from the Sikh who are separatists Their brand of terrorism has been significantly reduced in the past years They are also plagued by the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden as described earlier China actually shares a thin strip of border with Afghanistan near Tajikistan Pakistan also borders on China Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this geographically from the billion people of China Having China on board is critical I would like the US to investigate TSI Telephone Services International a New Jersey Corporation and Unocal a California Oil Company Both of these companies have had business dealings with the Taliban government I believe that corporate greed with total disregard for the human condition in any country is unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with accordingly And I think the investment community needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations who dabble in business with terror linked organizations The investment community was hit particularly hard i hope going forward there will be a clear message to stop support for companies who may potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans We may need to legally restrict what our corporations can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals with based on the opportunity cost of potential terrorist activity By all means no corporation should have had any business dealings with the Taliban perhaps this should be enforced by law Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND I firmly believe that the deadened state of intellectual discussion concerning these issues in America is part of the problem We have been funneling our best minds into Technology Banking Law and Medicine for a very long time The general lack of information and interest in world political and human conditions and the evolution of human governments is dangerous The average American simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to express to our government on what we can do to ensure the survival of our way of life and the spread of goodwill Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful military strike will initiate this new campaign I think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we really are about to embark on Our army may well include the corporate army and the casualties will be civilian We need to get every American to study this condition its roots causes directions and what we can do to end it Americans need to start an intelligent dialogue around the country publicly so that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of the world that we are educated and serious about achieving a solution Our military domination is already known throughout the world Perhaps our longterm goal may involve bolstering the middleclass communities in these nations assuming they are moderate tolerant and peaceloving they need something to lose and conversely something to protect To get there we will need to eradicate any fundamentalist governments like the Taliban under no circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the terrorist organizations down within their borders We need to seize assets disable communications engage in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign Lets focus our efforts on thinking and providing our leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom an opinion from within While I trust the powers that be to handle these affairs I never believed any day in my life that we were so vulnerable Know the enemy The threat of biochemical weapons a simple overview of what the most likely agents are sectionsscienceDailyNewsdeadlygashtml sectionsscienceDailyNewsdeadlygashtml There is one company in America that is contracted by the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine the BioPort Corporation formerly known as the Michigan Biologic Products Institute MBPI I hope the defense around that company is solid Hopefully this will generate some interest in developing a public discussion regarding strategies for the eradication of terrorism and governments that support them actively tacitly or otherwise bin Laden Imad Mughniyeh head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah and the Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri senior member of AlQaeda and possible and the Taliban should go first then perhaps the other organizations mentioned above Then what Hussein Qaddafi Will Egypt be on board when the Al Jihad unleash terror in Egypt Do these nations host silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within their borders completely bending to the will of terrorists for fear of their people being injured Is that support or a successful campaign of terror Where do we draw the line I suppose where you stand
