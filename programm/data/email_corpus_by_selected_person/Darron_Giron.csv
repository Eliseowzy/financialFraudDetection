allowing me to buy them through you long term See you Saturday They should be pretty good this year But Ive certainly heard that before DG Original Message From ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESCdavidEplaisanceusEpwcglobalEcomE NRONcom Sent Thursday August AM To Giron Darron C Subject RE Season tix are in Im certainly OK with the arrangement long term if youre happy with your seats I would have liked to get you down lower but that wont be possible today without a much larger contribution And Im OK with you helping with the foundation contribution you just wont get any recognition from Texas or from the IRS with that arrangement And with the job market these days there might come a time when I cant continue my own level of giving and then everyone will have to make a decision Id lower my giving so that the total contribution was level year after year If and when you decided to stop Id have to start making up the difference again to keep my seats on row Or Id be bumped somewhere I got this many because people started asking about getting tickets this is probably how a lot of people do it Im not sure today if I could add any more to the general area where everyone is Sheila and Mark are still getting tix on AM To David AS cc Subject RE Season tix are in I didnt think about it from your point of view and if some day I decide not to help anymore then you get hurt because your contribution falls So just disregard that suggestion I guess Im trying to feel you out about the possibility of continuing this current arrangement longterm Because I will commit to purchase the current two and would like to get two more for a total of from now on It really would be better for me to continue this arrangement rather than get them on my own because like you indicated I would have to really pony up alot of to keep similar seats Im just not sure what your plans would be for my current tickets and if at some point you would like them back for yourself How did you end up with so many Is Mark still getting the two next to mine Just curious Dont worry about the OU tix I will find you on Saturday Thanks as always DG Original Message From ENRON

sorry Lets try to hook up Saturday I wouldnt mind help with the Foundation contribution but the downside all belongs to you I could practically guarantee that if you were to split away and create your own foundation giving youd get knocked out of your seats unless you jumped in at the levelyr or higher Any money given to me would not be qualified for a tax credit for you And if you decide in the future to start anyway you lose all the prior years cumulative giving where you didnt start Any any money you gave me wouldnt mean wed be guaranteed better OU tix or season tix because I would lower my personal contribution by the same amount I dont want to be on the hook for the extra contribution should you decide in the future to stop helping That said that may not be important for you and you wont mind sending me dollars I know I wouldnt be getting OU tix at all if it wasnt for my contribution to the Foundation Not all Foundation members are getting OU tix any more so I continue to consider myself lucky to continue getting tickets at all Your choice on PM To David AS cc Subject RE Season tix are in I believe it was That was X X The two I have are Sec Row Seats I meant season tix But would probably also try to get OU as well I guess Im wrestling with the idea of getting them in my name but I know the seat location would not be very good I really would like to have season ticket seats together I have been getting these through you for years now and dont have a problem with just continuing this arrangement I also wouldnt be opposed to helping with the contribution to

you mean season and OU or just one or the other The only way you can get more OU seats than your season tix is if someone else in the group doesnt want to buy OU tix with their season tix Im glad they

about billion the bulk of its available bank cred it lines in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu idity Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about billion of outstanding commercial paper shortterm corporate IOUs according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy c oncern with a cash cushion Some observers believe the move is a preemptiv e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibilliondollar credit line Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong But when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank s aid an Enron spokesman In a statement the companys new chief financial o fficer Jeff McMahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are mak ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energytrading concern in the past days Enron is the natio ns largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly onequarter of all e lectricity and naturalgas trades Yesterday for example Enron was involv ed in about billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit Since early last week Enrons share price has plummeted Last week it reported a million thirdquarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of billion It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer And rew S Fastow who was replaced Wednesday The drawdown of the credit facilities came as one rating agency Fitch pu t Enron on review for a possible downgrade while another Standard Poor s changed Enrons credit outlook to negative from stable Moodys Investor s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron In order to fall below investment grade Enrons credit rating would have t o fall several notches If that were to happen however a host of bad consequences could follow T ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price a noninvestmentgrade ra ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings In that event Enron could be forced to issue mi llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt diluting the value of ex isting shares At pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Enro n was down six cents at Liquidity is a key issue for Enron which handles energytrading volumes mo re than triple its nextbiggest competitor American Electric Power Co Enr ons EnronOnline Internetbased trading platform has transacted more than billion of trades since it was created in November The companys wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und erperforming assets elsewhere in the company chiefly the approximately billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate it takes time to sell assets parti cularly in todays slower economy The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha t have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealing s with Mr Fastow the former chief financial officer Internal documents r elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left Enron While Enron disclose d its Fastowrelated transactions in SEC filings a computerized search of the SECs database of public filings produced no reference to this other em ployeerelated entity known as Chewco Chewco was established in with approximately million in capital commitments to buy an interest in Enron assets according to one of the pa rtnerships documents The document didnt further specify what assets were purchased and it didnt disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper a manag ing director in Enrons Global Equity Markets Group according to the docum ent Enron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em ployeerelated entities were legal and properly disclosed didnt have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco Mr Kopper who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t o run the Fastowrelated partnerships didnt return phone calls A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr Kopper was traveling In respon se to questions about Chewco an Enron spokesman would say only that Micha el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron Mr Fastow repeatedly h as declined interview requests He severed his relationships with the partn erships in July This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar ding relatedparty transactions Under SEC rule SK a company has to repor t any transaction that exceeds and involves any director or execut ive officer By contrast Mr Fastow as CFO would have fallen into that category but Mr Kopper as managing director of a business unit presumab ly wouldnt have However reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard seems to have a broader definition one that might include Mr Kopper According to FAS Statement a relatedparty transaction involves a mate rial piece of business between the company and a member of management The statement defines management as directors top officers vice presidents i n charge of major business units and other persons who perform similar pol

was quoted at cents on the dollar down from a bid of late Wednesday and representing a d rop during the past two weeks That is far less than the decline in Enrons stock price since the Oct disclosure of a billion charge linked to soured investments resu lting in a million thirdquarter loss But the fall in the bonds pric e translates to a yield of percentage points above bellwether US gove rnment bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two we eks ago Although Enron still is an investmentgrade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl e B or lower Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than billion on its bank credit l ines to shore up its finances Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds Yes terdays bid for instance was for a block of less than million in b onds a small percentage of a typical trade Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that creditrating con cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga tion and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer Even at these levels theres very little buying interest said Harold Ri vkin a principal at distresseddebt trader H Rivkin Co in Princeton N J In one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect thems elves from losses on Enron debt was surging The cost

list opting instead to revise its lon gterm ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the companys f inancial flexibility Meanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst These are investmentgrade bonds that are migrating toward dis tressed levels said Glenn Reynolds an analyst at Credit Sights Inc an independent fixedincome research firm in New York They arent distressed yet but they are headed in that direction If Enrons credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the c ompanys ability to raise money For an energy trader a credit downgrade s ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities Though it is best known fo r trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacit y and steel As a market maker matching buyers and sellers Enron handles a bout a quarter of all the trading in the nations energy and gas markets Enrons creditworthiness is hugely important The better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or

article Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Heard on the Street Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal C Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Enron Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about In recent years Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly critic s would say blindly enthusiastic about Enron even as they acknowledge n ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f or its soaring profits Now Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i ts most complicated transactions which many on Wall Street still cant fig ure out In a research note Wednesday Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif ficult to value the company The companys lack of disclosure and transpar ency he says is a longstanding Enron hallmark So is this a stock to avoid in his view Hardly Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its US Select List which consists of a few dozen top st ock picks but Mr Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firms la rger but prestigious Recommended List of or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined Goldman in Just because I cant be specific in being able to create a simple model doesnt mean that you write off that industry and say I cant analyze it or I cant figure it out says Mr Fleischer who owns an undisclos ed number of Enron shares If that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldnt follow Enrons shares have dropped about since last week Every sellside analyst we spoke to early in admitted that this was a black box says Jim Chanos principal of Kynikos Associates in New York who has been selling Enron stock short trading it with an eye to profiti ng from its fall throughout this year It was really a trustme story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l evel of trust True no stock picker is immune from bad calls And Wall Street analysts lo ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investmentbanking deals to be had But Enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still rec ommending the stock have acknowledged that the companys disclosure practic es are lacking Which raises the question How can an analyst recommend tha t others purchase a stock when key information about the companys operatio ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business arent new Many of the issues now plaguing Enrons stock were first raised more than a year ago b y bearish hedgefund managers and independent accounting experts Yet time and again Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger ing questions about the companys various partnership transactions Besides those partnerships Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings Through it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stockmarket darli ng publicly dismissing questions about the firms accounting practices and level of disclosure As of yesterday of the analysts who following the stock had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to Thomson FinancialFirst Call Five others rated the stock a buy thoug h not strongly Only Prudential Securities which downgraded the stock this week has a se ll rating on Enron The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most highprofile exampl es of Wall Street taking a glass halffull stance despite what in retrospe ct seems to be ample warning that a lessenthusiastic approach was warrante d Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Indexs general coll apse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence part icularly those who like Goldmans Mr Fleischer own shares in the compani es they cover Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investmentbanking fees an d other revenue Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms For instance fo r one million equity offering in led by Credit Suisse First Bost on Enron retained seven comanagers including Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch Enron is a big company and I dont think youre going to find a firm that hasnt been involved says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a price target They p ay a lot of investmentbanking fees to Wall Street He adds We do our analysis every day based on the information we have Ar e we here strictly to defend companies Thats ludicrous Were here to pro vide information to investors Yes I have the wrong recommendation o n the stock I dont think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p erformed Mr Fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small But he di sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised Mr Fleischer sa ys his clients are happy to know he has a stake in Enron because it show s he puts his money where his mouth is In his research note Wednesday Mr Fleischer called for complete disclosur es of Enrons offbalance sheet partnerships Despite the resulting difficu lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given Enron th e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position a s an industry leader Theres not information to really model this and be able to predict accura tely where revenues are going to come from and where theyre going to make their money but every quarter they do he says Its hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver CSFBs Mr Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasio nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press On Monday he wrote that he expects questions about Enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for Enron an d an ultimate recovery in the share price I know Im wrong on the stock Mr Launer says But he says that at these prices he isnt ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worstcase scenario under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as billion worth of shares diluting current holders the stoc k doesnt have much further to fall Clearly Messrs Launer and Flesicher arent alone Even in relative terms analysts remain very bullish on this stock says Chuck Hill director of research at Thomson FinancialFirst Call The average rating for a stock o n Wall Street is or slightly shy of a buy rating Enron scores a This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out Mr Hill says In downgrading the stock this week Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i t to sell from buy with a brief stop at hold While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock she openly concedes her rece nt downgrades come too little too late Ms Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years She says the co mpanys disclosure practices fall far short of ideal and senior executives are often evasive even when presented with direct questions For instance she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission They said no she says

Guardian Copyright C The Guardian Source World Reporter TM Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars bn pounds bn tax rebate under a Dollars bn eocnomic stimulation package just app roved by the Republicancontrolled House of Representatives The controversial package worth an estimated Dollars bn over three year s includes Dollars bn for companies next year alone It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by votes to but faces significant amen dment in the Senate which is now under Democrat control It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans who favour cor porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession and Democrats who in a reprise of the Roosevelt new deal prefer to see i ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars bn to the biggest corporations which they say are renowned for paying l ittle or no tax The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax or AMT introduced in to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments This strongly supported by President Bush would be mad e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded The lobby groups and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service calcul ate that this would give a Dollars bn boost to computer group IBM alone while General Motors would get back Dollars m and General Electric Doll ars m Others to benefit include TXU the Texasbased utility that is the USs thi rd largest energy supplier which would would be given Dollars m United Airlines the USs second largest carrier which is warning of bankruptcy would receive Dollars m and Enron the energy trading group forced t o sack its finance director this week would be given Dollars m Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis like other proposals to boost firms which include a tax break for capi tal investment over three years worth Dollars bn this year alone They say these amount to a giant corporate giveaway Mr Bush and other

Section C Harvey Pitts SEC From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy By FLOYD NORRIS The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company CAN the new friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy Harvey L Pitt the new SEC chairman set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor Arthur Levitt In a speech to the American Ins titute of Certified Public Accountants an organization whose senior lead ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr Levitts reform efforts Mr Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h is predecessor From now on he promised the commission will make sound decisions in a respectful affirmative way not in a demeaning demanding or demonizing wa y He spoke favorably of pro forma earnings reports in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev en the worst profit figures look pretty There was no mention of Mr Levitt s concerns about improper management of earnings On the heels of Mr Pitts speech the SEC used a minor enforcement acti on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t o report their own errors The decision itself was reasonable although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years But the way the SEC trumpeted it raised qu estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th an a guard dog Is this amnesty for financial fraud Jane Adams the ac counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former SEC staff me mber asked in a report to clients She was not sure of the answer In an interview yesterday Mr Pitt dismissed such worries No one is goi ng to get away with anything he said What we are trying to do is crea te an environment where people feel comfortable and can talk to the SEC without feeling we are looking for a big splash A major embarrassment for accountants is having the SEC force a client t o restate its numbers Mr Pitt and his chief accountant Robert Herdman a re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made I am very much i n favor of a vigorous enforcement program Mr Pitt said in the interview but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state ments and restatements Mr Pitt talks of companies getting it right the first time which woul d certainly be nice But there is a risk that companies will become more ag gressive in their accounting figuring there will be no real penalty like a restatement if they are caught That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting In trying to sound comforting to the accountants group an organization that as he noted he had represented as a lawyer for two decades Mr Pi tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence The proof of course will come in the performance Fortunately the mess a t Enron gives the SEC a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image I t will take time for the commission to determine if the companys accountin g was proper But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai n rather than obfuscate as it has so far the strange deals it made wi th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer This could a former SEC staff member said focus the issue on whe ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur es And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite Photo Harvey L Pitt Copyright Dow

United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest Rule No in CEO school Never say that your company may soon collapse Seems kind of obvious but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J ames Goodwin who

mon ey he wrote In raising concerns about the financial viability of United a unit of UAL UALNYSE news commentary Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about Since Sept the

been roundly attacked Feeli ng that he had been all too honest investors have knocked an additional off the stocks value The shares are down since Sept Meanwhile UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations The leaders of one un ion have petitioned the companys board of directors to have him sacked Bottom line CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth but s ometimes it doesnt pay to be too candid about worstcase scenarios either Especially when that scenario is the companys own demise Forget the Victory Gardens Lets Have a Comfortable War Sure were at war with a band of cavedwelling outlaws hell bent on our an nihilation But would all freedomloving Americans please go out and buy so me DVD players Maybe even a nice new car That was basically the message from the Treasury Department on news that C ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef forts and rebuilding following the attacks Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff The economy is per haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa r on global terrorists says Betsy Holahan a department spokesperson Wa r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism For the record we dont think an issue of war bonds would be dumb just su perfluous After all nothings stopped Americans from buying generic savin gs bonds or better yet Treasuries all of which finance spending by t he federal government In the meantime its a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds which most people associate with hardship and

stock price from undermining investors confidence in the sector They say the Houstonbased companys problems should be viewed in isolatio n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace The

First came reports that some of the companys losses stemmed from partnersh ips managed by Enrons chief financial officer at the time Andrew Fastow That raised concerns about a potential conflict of

Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices Even though Enron shot themselves in the foot the

energy industry li ke Enron California and whether the US will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t o Enron We continue to assess the situation but right now dont have any net expo sure to Enron said Calpines vice president of corporate risk management Paul Pasoli We continue to trade with them We will adjust our credit th reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha lted immediately Pasoli said that in fact Calpine would owe Enron a litt le money In another energy industry area of concern Calpine was asked about the sta te of Californias stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of longterm power contracts Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts which on a marktomarket basis are worth far less now th an when California bought this past winter and spring Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont racts In general we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t o do so as well said Calpine cheif executive Peter Cartwright If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a winwin we would be happy to look at that if California asks Weve done that many times As for future power prices Calpine said that its going forward with its p rogram to build a portfolio of megawatts of generation which is abo ut three times its current capacity and would be about of all US capac ity The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d ifference between natural gas prices and power prices and Calpine said tha t difference or spark spread has grown the past few months Furthermore the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr ojects generate an aftertax return of on the investment As a result the company expects earnings to grow at least annually thr ough Calpine will fund nearterm

Lay Jeffrey K Skilling and Andrew Fastow on behal f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu ary and October inclusive the Class Period The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections b and a of the Securities Exchange Act of and Rule b promulgated thereunder by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J anuary and October

meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy ii that the Companys operating results were materially overstated as result of th e Company failing to timely writedown the value of its investments with ce rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Companys chief financ ial officer and iii that Enron was failing to writedown impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP On October Enron surp rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking nonrecurring ch arges of billion aftertax or loss per diluted share in the third quarter of the period ending September Subsequently Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enrons chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin g more than billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o f the investments As this news began to be assimilated

rons bonds wont continue to hold up better the companys stock The companys fiveyear bond has decreased about in the past two weeks much less than the decline in Enrons stock price since the Oct di sclosure of the billion charges But the fall in the bonds price translates to a yield of percentage po ints above bellwether US government bonds which is widening from about percentage points two

being selfdeprecatingbut I hope I never meet him on game day A chronology of events for Saturday December and the early morning hours of Sunday December Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at fullfreaking blast Get in car drive to New Braunfels Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST teetime of the morning Turn crack open first beer Crack open second beer Crack openyou get the idea Finish holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth Headed for San Antonio Alamodome Nebraska vs Texas Buy three packs for pre and postgame festivities We decide we dont have enough booze so we doubleback to a liquor store and buy the good ol ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About degrees I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a twostory parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT In the postserenade serendipity grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and cans of beer into my pants I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as CellPhone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those nonrefundable nontransferrable sonsofbitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix nonrefundable and nontransferrable Price He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pregame kingdom Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas The first quarter mercifully ends yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety Halftime score Nebraska Texas I wish I had another Traveler While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Briceism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused I buy my nd and rd beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more beers from the Alamodome merchants Score is Nebraska Texas I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are nonrefundable and nontransferrable I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo the Texas mascot stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some offcolor remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the basketball game TexasArizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truckmate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly I am rallying I have warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona Halftime score Texas Arizona I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Centermuch less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a onequarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid cocksucker I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a

I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight We have finished threequarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost years And I can honestly say that I aint never

Sent Wednesday November AM To Subject COME EARLY BE LOUD STAY LATE tEXas tailgatES talk We will all need to chip in a few dollars for the ENORMOUS thank you card going to Stillwater this week I gave the Cowboys no chance to win that game and after seeing the highlights reading the paper etc I still would give them no chance It just goes to show that what I think means absolutely nothing Wow This game was eerily similar to the TexasOU game Both defense were stellar and shutdown the oppositions offense Some complaints I have heard center on the lack of offenseoffensive creativity in the AM game and Chris Simms decision making in the passing game I disagree If you were at the game you noticed the wind was swirling something fierce and gusting upwards of around mph at times Both punters struggled in the st half with punts of and yards Aggie qb Mark Farris threw deep a few times and was picked off once and if not for some superb plays by his wrs at least twice more Texas jumped out early with a td off of a blocked punt and then went into the playitsafe mode Seeing that balls thrown deep were floating up for grabs and the Aggie offenses inability to move the ball consistently the Longhorns played the OUstyle field position game and kept the crowd out of it except for the yard punt return by Mickey Jones in the rd quarter when Texas te Mike Jones was liquidated on a block and eventually wore down the undermanned Aggies with scores late in the th Could the offense have played better Sure They would certainly be the first to tell you that Simms in my opinion did exactly what the coaches asked him to do play it safe dont go for the home run and dont give them anything cheap to fire up the crowd He did just that No turnovers no silly passes well His touch seemed a little off throwing behind some receivers on occasion but he also looked fantastic in the clutch He fired a missile between Aggies to hit Bo Scaife on rd at the Aggie on the games go ahead touchdown drive Benson scored on the next play He took what the defense gave him and now the horns are in Dallas Fine with me A point win at the feared Kyle Field The Texas Defense is ON FIRE They held the inept Aggie offense to yards total pass rush and touchdown AM Aggie qb Mark Farris was never able to find his receivers and twice found Longhorn defenders wide open Neither offense looked particularly sharp but the horns found a way to pull it out Good teams win Period THE BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Texas vs Colorado PM ABC Ask and ye shall receive Here we are The Longhorns come in Winners of the south thanks Pokes and CU comes in claiming the north title These two unexpected opponents know each other pretty well Texas beat the Buffs back on Oct th in Austin CU looked a little lost that day and Texas pounced on them and wore them down These are not your October Buffalos folks This team has found itself and is brimming with confidence after they thumped Nebraska Put it away Buffs you get the Burnt Orange this week Keys for the game Texas needs to stop the run understatement of the year The Longhorns will put and in the box to stop the quartet of CU backs and dare Bobby Pesavento to beat them CU has in my opinion the best tight end in college football in Daniel Graham He could not be stopped when they met the Huskers and single handedly kept the Nebraska dbs from crowding the line of scrimmage Daniel this is Nathan Vasher On offense Texas will look for the pass to open the run Colorado has a suspect secondary and the horns will try to exploit that with the UT Towers If this happens look for Texas to run well in the nd half tEXas tailgate We are having a tEXas tailgate It will be located at the University of Dallas right across the street from Texas Stadium It will begin

Sent Thursday December PM To Subject COME EARLY BE LOUD STAY LATE tEXas tailgatES talk Okay I have come off of the ledge I thought about a lot of things when I was out there what if the punt was tipped what if it was a safety what in the world was going through Gary Barnetts mind on that fake punt what if the field goal was good wow its really high up here Mostly I thought this no more Dallas Lets not play any more games in the DFW area nothing good happens We will meet the Okies in Waco and playem at Baylor Whos going to mind Certainly not the Bears they really dont use the field much any way and certainly not me If you were a rd party observer this game was probably very exciting Texas goes up early Colorado roars ahead at half and Texas fights back but falls just short I AM NOT a rd party observer The Horns were so close points away from a Big XII Championship Doh Give the Buffaloes their credit they brought that nasty running game that we all thought was an aberration vs Nebraska Chris Brown looked liked he was feet tall have you ever seen a guy run higher than him He makes Eddie George look like a hunchback It was like watching Michael Johnson sprint and the CU oline was just evil or of those guys will be playing on Sundays next year On defense the horns lack of size showed Its hard to stop a power running game thats clicking with small tackles or even big ones ask Nebraska and quick defensive ends To their credit the Texas defense did not fold but fought the good fight and stemmed the tide holding CU to points in the nd half The st half was the killer The st half Oh The Horns looked great to start the game but things went wrong Chris Simms didnt play well and would be the st to tell you that it was his worst game at Texas so far interceptions and fumble Ouch Cedric Benson was running well carries for yards and a score before he was hurt with a pinched nerve The horns got down and it looked like they would be blown out thats sort of how the OU game in started but they refused to die and fought back to near even Major Applewhite went from cult hero to certified legend by throwing a yd touchdown pass on his nd play after replacing an injured Simms and Texas nearly pulled it out but was too far back in the long run I want to talk about Simms for a second It would be absurd to say that those turnovers werent the main reason Texas lost It was Chris played badly Horrible There is no other way to say it He is a big boy and I am quite sure he has the mental toughness to hear this and Im sure he has and learn from it It was not your day Lefty turn the page and move on Everybody has them Ty Detmer threw picks in game this year Kurt Warner had v the Saints You will no doubt have more of those when you get to the League in There is no shame in playing bad as long as you learn something from it You had bad days in but you also had good ones and or great ones Get that down to next year and you will hear no complaints from me of course Im not speaking for everyone I thought the coaches called a good game Greg Davis opened up the playbook with some reverses and deep middlestuff and Carl Reese was working uphill most of the night and still held CU to passing and total The blocked punt call in my opinion was a good call Texas got one at AM and needed some help at that point To ask the Horns to go yards through the air there was no Benson so no running game with your big tackle Mike Williams out of the game would have been a tall order Get the block and you set up shop at midfield or even run it back for They didnt get the block obviously Teams call the puntblock all of the time but dont hit the kicker The kid for Texas missed the punt by inches but fell into the CU punter st down Tough break Hindsight is but I would call it again tEXas tailgate is in the works It will not be the traditional tailgate like last year but more of a gathering somewhere like a bar restaurant or hotel before we all head to the stadium Another email will follow as soon as it is set up Travel packages The Texas Exes are hosting a trip to San Diego Please click on the link for information newsitemphpid News and Notes Major Applewhite will start the Holiday Bowl Cedric got his Benson only played a half but his yards put him at yards for the year He is the th player to rush for a grand at Texas Major Applewhites yards passing give him career yards breaking the alltime record of James Brown The Vapor is good Nathan Vasher tied a school record with interceptions in a season He also had yards in punt returns giving him for the year breaking the school record of Johnnie Johnson BJ Johnsons yard touchdown catch was his th reception of yards All have been touchdowns BJ had his st td game and his th yard game DD Lewis started his th consecutive game Saturday breaking the school record of held by Dan Neil Hats off to Alfio Randall The Big Cat filled in for an injured Mike Williams and did not let his man touch

Chris Simms have identical records Around the Conference Coach Bob lost his offensive coordinator Mark Mangino accepted the Head Coaching job at Kansas Sorry Coach Bob Mangino should be okay there if

Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x,giron-d,Employee

Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Subject Highlights from this mornings ENEDYN analyst conference call Listened in on the analyst call this morning Here are my notes Did not yet have a chance to organize them so theyre simply in chronological order The call began with Watson Bergstrom and Whalley reading from prepared statements Watson spoke for c minutes Bergstrom for and Whalley spoke for perhaps seconds Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them Specific points EES will be a part of the new company Enron assets will be revalued at closing The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred If the merger does not go through Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for very little additional consideration If DYN terminates the merger and ENE has sufficient liquidity ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred Debtequity of combined company expected to be Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative ChevronTexaco will hold MM shares out of a total MM shares of the postmerger entity Watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and offbalancesheet leverage In what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true Dynegy owed Enron MM Lay says that Enron had other options particularly financial All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be pretty big but that the companies feel theyre able to appropriately value this exposure Lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way Lay had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps MM more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for offbalancesheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs Dynegy says that several internal investigations continue at Enron and thus DYNENE cannot say with certainty that theres absolutely nothing else out there Doty Dynegy CFO says that late last week ENE had close to a billion in cash Osprey will be unwound late next summer Marlin will be unwound after closing Many of the offbalancesheet structures including the creditlinked notes are expected to be unwoundredeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing With regard to ENE asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible However Doty says that our backs are not against the wall and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ENE will renew its day facility believe this is the Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next weeks BBBflat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies McMahon says no comment to WSJ article indicating that ENEs banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks Consolidation of trading activity Mid and backoffice consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing EES NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity so there wont be much integration work required there The big integration effort will be ENA Watson says that the creative financing surrounded noncore assets Doty adds that frankly DYN assigned zero economic value to noncore businesses in their valuation model They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the noncore assetsbusinesses and left it at that Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by Enrons top three executives who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies Says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegys deliberations on proceeding with the merger WatsonDoty said that theyre NOT sure that no surprises remain in Enrons booksbut that the riskreward offered by the combination was compelling The deal does have materialadversechange outs for Dynegy covering any MAC regarding Enrons assets or businesses Dynegys lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a blunt instrument under which it would be difficult to bring a case so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enrons total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops Bn prior to closing McMahon adds that there could be more restatements but he does not expect there to be more restatements ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron Enron is planning to hold an Enronspecific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for Wednesday Initial reaction of ratings agencies very positive to combined entities McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to yearend had the merger not materialized Dynegys earnings guidance places Enronrelated earnings accretion at which represents a haircut to Enron internal estimates Doty says that this is all operating earningsfigure does not include any amounts from expected synergies Doty says that both Enron and Dynegys books as far as he understands are relatively shortterm in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity Says a very very substantial portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash ChevronTexacos investment in Dynegy was calculated at a discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week ChevronTexacos investment is now at a more substantial discount to market prices ChevronTexaco has provision to get different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better No further clarification given Whalley believes that well retain the Enron traders and marketers Theyre used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders and they are very excited by the combination They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions He says that to the extent necessary yes Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENEthere will be more of an assetbacked trading focus but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial marketmaking trading than the Dynegy of today Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture hes a strong team player He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well Give me a call if youd like me to try to clarify any of these comments Patrick Tucker x,giron-d,Employee

NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name

Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated

To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this

News Texas writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for where we are today If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter Registration To find or change your password modify your account or unsubscribe fro

Victor Guggenheim PM To Phillip M CT Darron C CT Jackson CT cc Subject FW Does your school qualify A school either is or it isnt Alabama is Notre Dame is Ohio State is Michigan is Texas is USC is Missouri thinks it is but is not Minnesota was but is no longer Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of is is Rice never was and Temple will never ever be We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college football program Mind you this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses Colorado won a national title in but is not a program Ohio State has not won one since but is Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business as much about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent Can we whistle your fight song Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to the front door If you answered yes yes yes and yes to the above you are likely a program You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it up in the South where the War of Northern Aggression has provided more than four score and seven years worth of motivation When Georgia program beat Michigan program at Ann Arbor in fans deluged the Bulldogs upon their return to Athens It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again former Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnharts new book Southern Fried Football What does it take to make our varsity National titles factor in and tradition is a must but there is much more to it than that A program must go the extra yard Any school willing buy out a head coachs contract no matter the length or the amount is a program Any school that keeps recruiting a player it cant get just to keep a rival schools top recruiter on the case is a program You probably also qualify if The square footage of your schools weight room is roughly equal to that of your towns municipal airport You think the man scholarship limit is a communist plot You contribute money to only two sports football and spring football You publicly support Title IX but privately think it has set your boys back years Hollywood has made a movie involving the program Rudy Big Chill Something For Joey Everybodys AllAmerican The Spirit of West Point Hold em Navy The Bear Knute Rockne All American Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Your school annually ranks in the preseason top no matter how many starters it has coming back Your head coach could run for Congress and win in a landslide They name city streets after your coaches and players The chief of police keeps mug photos of your players in his top drawer Your head coach leads practice with a megaphone from a tower You have a living mascot UGA Mike the Tiger Bevo although this does not guarantee enshrinement see Ralphie at Colorado To what length will you go for your program Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent running free down the sideline a la Alabamas Tommy Lewis against Rices Dickie Moegle in the Cotton Bowl Are you arrogant enough pay attention here USC and Notre Dame to keep scheduling top opponents because you believe in your heart you are one national television victory from getting back in title contention You get program bonus points if you had a coach or player nicknamed Shug Bump Rip Gus Bear Bubba Duffy Muddy Notable exceptions Orin Babe Hollingbery at Washington State and Texas El Pasos Cactus Jack Curtice You are a program if you can overlook your head coachs scandalous extramarital affair as long as he defeats Auburn You are probably a program if youve had or fewer coaches in the last years Since for example Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and Joe Paterno who have amassed a combined record of Penn State is a program Lastly and this is very importantit can make or break a program Are you willing to accept NCAA sanctions as a reasonable condition for winning a national title This factor alone tipped the University of Washington off the program fence You are likely not a program if You produce boatloads of NFL players but cant sell out home games You sell your tickets to the Rose Bowl when your team is in it Your marching band is banned from playing at a game but your team isnt You sell your home game to an opponent for financial considerations Your arena is named after a basketball coach but the football stadium is named after a philanthropist You play in a conference that ends with any combination of the letters U S and A You play in a domed stadium Your most famous football player made his name in baseball You ripped your fight song off from Nebraska and changed the words The list Program note If your school is not among the following you are most likely a rat for the NCAA The Programs NOTRE DAME The whole nine yards Equal parts love hate hype history myth combined now with firstever NCAA sanctions They ought to make several movies ALABAMA Bear Bryant left Texas AM program in to return to Tuscaloosa Asked why Bear said Mama called MICHIGAN You are a

NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name

To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this

Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might not know it until some time later Oooo Some people come into our lives and quickly go oooO Some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful Oooo footprints on our hearts oooO and we are

worth looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might

Victor Guggenheim PM To Phillip M CT Darron C CT Jackson CT cc Subject FW Does your school qualify A school either is or it isnt Alabama is Notre Dame is Ohio State is Michigan is Texas is USC is Missouri thinks it is but is not Minnesota was but is no longer Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of is is Rice never was and Temple will never ever be We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college football program Mind you this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses Colorado won a national title in but is not a program Ohio State has not won one since but is Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business as much about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent Can we whistle your fight song Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to the front door If you answered yes yes yes and yes to the above you are likely a program You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it up in the South where the War of Northern Aggression has provided more than four score and seven years worth of motivation When Georgia program beat Michigan program at Ann Arbor in fans deluged the Bulldogs upon their return to Athens It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again former Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnharts new book Southern Fried Football What does it take to make our varsity National titles factor in and tradition is a must but there is much more to it than that A program must go the extra yard Any school willing buy out a head coachs contract no matter the length or the amount is a program Any school that keeps recruiting a player it cant get just to keep a rival schools top recruiter on the case is a program You probably also qualify if The square footage of your schools weight room is roughly equal to that of your towns municipal airport You think the man scholarship limit is a communist plot You contribute money to only two sports football and spring football You publicly support Title IX but privately think it has set your boys back years Hollywood has made a movie involving the program Rudy Big Chill Something For Joey Everybodys AllAmerican The Spirit of West Point Hold em Navy The Bear Knute Rockne All American Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Your school annually ranks in the preseason top no matter how many starters it has coming back Your head coach could run for Congress and win in a landslide They name city streets after your coaches and players The chief of police keeps mug photos of your players in his top drawer Your head coach leads practice with a megaphone from a tower You have a living mascot UGA Mike the Tiger Bevo although this does not guarantee enshrinement see Ralphie at Colorado To what length will you go for your program Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent running free down the sideline a la Alabamas Tommy Lewis against Rices Dickie Moegle in the Cotton Bowl Are you arrogant enough pay attention here USC and Notre Dame to keep scheduling top opponents because you believe in your heart you are one national television victory from getting back in title contention You get program bonus points if you had a coach or player nicknamed Shug Bump Rip Gus Bear Bubba Duffy Muddy Notable exceptions Orin Babe Hollingbery at Washington State and Texas El Pasos Cactus Jack Curtice You are a program if you can overlook your head coachs scandalous extramarital affair as long as he defeats Auburn You are probably a program if youve had or fewer coaches in the last years Since for example Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and Joe Paterno who have amassed a combined record of Penn State is a program Lastly and this is very importantit can make or break a program Are you willing to accept NCAA sanctions as a reasonable condition for winning a national title This factor alone tipped the University of Washington off the program fence You are likely not a program if You produce boatloads of NFL players but cant sell out home games You sell your tickets to the Rose Bowl when your team is in it Your marching band is banned from playing at a game but your team isnt You sell your home game to an opponent for financial considerations Your arena is named after a basketball coach but the football stadium is named after a philanthropist You play in a conference that ends with any combination of the letters U S and A You play in a domed stadium Your most famous football player made his name in baseball You ripped your fight song off from Nebraska and changed

News Texas writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a difficult gam e at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win I also didnt think that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country Our current rank within the Top is much more fitting for

them to stitch sweatshop onto his shoes Heres the responses he got fun and games with Nike From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the following reasons Your Personal iD contains another partys trademark Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we do not have the legal right to use Your Personal

NIKE iD does not violate any of the criteria outlined in your message The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word sweatshop Sweatshop is not anothers partys trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the children that made my shoes Could you please ship them to me immediately Thanks and Happy New Year Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen contains as stated in the previous email correspondence inappropriate slang If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at nikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do I normally avoid

To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes Although I commend you for your prompt customer service I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was inappropriate slang After consulting Websters Dictionary I discovered that sweatshop is in fact part of standard English and not slang The word means a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long hours at low wages and under unhealthy conditions and its origin dates from So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is about freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are I share Nikes love of freedom and personal expression The site also says that If you want it done rightbuild it yourself I was thrilled to be able to build my own shoes and my personal iD was offered as a small token of appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order Thank you Jonah Peretti From Personalize NIKE iD To Jonah H Peretti Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Customer Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE iD web site that Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to hours after it has been submitted In addition it further explains While we honor most personal iDs we cannot honor every one Some may be or contain others trademarks or the names of certain professional sports teams athletes or celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use Others may contain material that we consider inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products Unfortunately at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable In any event we will let you know if we decline your personal iD and we will offer you the chance to submit another With these rules in mind we cannot accept your order as submitted If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization please visit us again at wwwnikecom Thank you NIKE iD From Jonah H Peretti To Personalize NIKE iD Subject RE Your NIKE iD order o Dear NIKE iD Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request I have decided to order the shoes with a different iD but I would like to make one small request Could you please send me a color snapshot of the tenyearold Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes Thanks Jonah Peretti As one forwarder writes this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do I normally avoid

News Texas writer answers your questions about what went wrong against Stanford Coach Mack Browns respon se to the loss the continuing quarterback controversy UT players in the NFL and more Inside UT Football appears every Thursday Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on dallasnewscoms Colleges site CHIP SHOTS Every year since Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g ames of the season That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa st years usually before TexasOU weekend Orangebloods spend winter spring and summer discussing the impact of n ew recruits the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning starters They spend money on season tickets airplane tickets and alumni luncheon tickets They dream big dreams and then by October the high hope s have usually come crashing down Only three times since has Texas opened the season and Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie or losses and In each of those seasons Texas ended up with four losses In UTs two best seasons since a campaign in and a run in the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season respectively Before Texas can dream about winning a national title the Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss Longhorn Q A Q Judging from the Stanford game as well as the last three games of l ast season it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue There is also no respect for our running game from any team that we face I think th e best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving us In order for us to achieve this I think it starts with us putting our b est athletes on the field on offense These guys may not be the most experience d players but they will gain experience with playing time and they have the ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz Its time to sta rt Roy Williams and BJ Johnson at receiver along with Montrell Flowers and play a oneback offensive set Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a nd Hodges Mitchell is not an Iback who is adept at following the fullback through the hole Hodges strength is operating in space and making people miss in the open field I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter back Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could and probably does possess all of the same skills He just hasnt had the chanc e to display them We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if we are going to turn this thing around If not I could see this season slipping to real quick What are your thoughts Chip The Jackson residence BROWN With any unexpected loss the tendency is to throw everyone out change coaches players even the bus driver You do that and you are telli ng this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them There cant be to o much change at any one time The big question is how the team responds to this Stanford loss emotionally Something tells me if Texas can find some resolve and perform really well youll see some solid performances at all the positions where problems currently exist In Texas was No and Notre Dame was No Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost UT th en lost three of its next four which included games against Oklahoma State Oklahoma and Colorado all teams Texas is about to face after this weeks opponent Houston That was a different coach and different players But the common thread was that Texas hit the top and then choked If Texas is hung over from its loss to Stanford trouble could be on the horizon If Texas can find resolv e to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that could go wrong did then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha rd team to beat the rest of the way Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor ns are not a very good football team right now The challenge has been made to his team If they come out and stink against Houston every position will b e scrutinized every coach even the bus driver There will be enough fire being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state Bu t changes will have to be made constructively and gradually IMAGE Chris Simms Q Whats going on with the quarterbacks Mitch Golding BROWN As the QBs turn This week it appears Chris Simms will start because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday That has been the trend Whoever practices with the first team gets the start Anyway well see how they respond after the Stanford game Major Applewhite was erratic in his play despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a miraculous victory Im sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games Granted if one struggles along the way the other will come in But Mac k Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of his experience and the fact that it was the teams first game on the road He said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms It would seem to me that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense lig ht it up and get on a roll when you are alternating but Ill continue to watc h like everyone else I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli na with success Of course with those QBs Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t o prepare for Davenports scrambling and Keldorfs passing With Simms and Applewhite you pretty much get the same style With Keldorf and Davenport you also had injuries dictate a few starts Q Can you tell us what influenced Mack Browns decision regarding the quarterbacks against Stanford Nels Marshall BROWN Here are Browns exact words Experience We were in a tight football game and Major Applewhite has been around a long time I was pro ud even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter that we didnt panic I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job of coming back and giving us a chance to win Sometimes youth doesnt look like it is trying because theyre nervous Instead they are trying too har d and get uptight Our team tried hard As negative as people make Saturday night it is one of those things that you have to grow from Q Im glad we have two great QBs My question is are the receivers ha ving any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a lefthanded or righthanded QB Dave Stastny Austin BROWN The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch ing the ball They do however say that Chris Simms ball will come a little faster and a little harder than Major Applewhites Q The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea r What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts I know that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons but can they al so apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of time Chad Graham BROWN No Once a freshman plays in a game even for one play and he d oes not suffer a seasonending injury the chance for a redshirt is out the window IMAGE Jermain Anderson Q Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b ack to linebacker If I remember correctly he played LB in high school at Texa s City He seems to still have good speed but also a problem putting on the necessary weight to play defensive end It just seems like he might be bett er suited for the outside linebacker rotation especially considering the progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton Cole Pittman and Adam Doiron Micah Hurt BROWN Coaches dont think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker They are pleased with the depth at linebacker as well They like Andersons instincts as a pass rusher They are still working on his ability to stop t he run Q My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn football schedule in your letter each week My husband Mark is a diehard Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in Through thick and thin he h as remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner fans Of course he does his fair share and probably more of bragging abo ut the Longhorns Barbara and Mark Harper BROWN As far as the schedule UTs remaining games are Sept home vs Houston at pm on Fox Sept home vs Oklahoma State at am on ABC Oct in Dallas vs Oklahoma TBA Oct at Colorado TBA Oct home vs Missouri TBA Oct home vs Baylor TBA Nov at Texas Tech TBA Nov at Kansas TBA Nov home vs Texas Aat pm on ABC Since you all have access to the Internet log onto UTs sports Web site texassportscom and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your area And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at dallasnewscom Q This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads ie hows Cedric Woodard Aaron Humphrey Kwame Cavil Thanks BROWN The Big office just released a list of former Texas players in the NFL However it includes some players who have been released For example Aaron Humphrey was released after a freeagent tryout with Tampa Bay Chris Smith was released after a freeagent tryout with Washington and Dallas Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota Vikings Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted Anyway here is the list as provided by the Big TEXAS Ben Adams OL Miami Taje Allen DB St Louis Tony Brackens DE Jacksonville Blake Brockermeyer OG Chicago Ricky Brown RB Cincinnati Chris Carter DB New England Kwame Cavil WR Buffalo Phil Dawson KS Cleveland Shane Dronett DL Atlanta Priest Holmes RB Baltimore Aaron Humphrey DE Tampa Bay Jay Humphrey OL Minnesota Derek Lewis TE St Louis Wane McGarity WR Dallas Eric Metcalf WR Carolina Dan Neil OL Denver Roger Roesler OL Cincinnati Chris Smith TE Dallas Winfred Tubbs LB San Francisco Bryant Westbrook DB Detroit Ricky Williams RB New Orleans Cedric Woodard DL Baltimore IMAGE Hodges Mitchell Q Dont know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y our column but Ive seen some unflattering trends in Mack Browns program and wanted your feedback Mack Brown is a great recruiter no argument there However can he motivate It seems like he cant get the team up sometime s and cant adjust the teams mood during a game About offensive coordinator Greg Davis I dont know who is responsible for the offensive line but since it is an offensive group in more ways than on e I put it under him With guys the size that UT has shouldnt even Hodges Mitchell be able to run Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro Why does Davis love Mitchell Sure he gained plus yards last year but how many of those yards were move the chains type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and protect a lead I thought it was going to be running back by committee but all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake abandoning th e run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations Mitchell can run to the outside but he cannot run through the defensive tackles And even if he does get holes he still will never break through t he linebackers for a TD Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there with Mitchell and go with a twoback threewide offense You dont lose a receiver as Hodges is a nice smart receiver Other ramblings Is Quentin Jammer really a corner He got beat MANY tim e against Stanford I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury may have forever changed his game if he cant play safety and cant keep up with opponents wideouts How is the defensive end position shaping up The defensive tackles were all over the field against Stanford but the DEs didnt make much noise What i s up with the blocked punts UT should be really really embarrassed Does Stockton take too long Is he too close to the line Can the line block Ca n anyone at UT block Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls Several tim es the camera caught clear holds by Stanfords line Why on earth would you ru n up the middle on your own goal line against two of the best DTs youll pla y against Andrew Bowen BROWN I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are incredibly pained shocked disappointed angered and hurt by last Saturday s events But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday he said its fair to beat the team up for not being able to run the ball But he said to jump on any other part of the team is to rip young inexperienced kids who are still learning what it takes to compete as a topranked team To be fair to Brown he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a nd needed time to grow into some key positions receiver defensive end fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner It probabl y isnt fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di d beat Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce If a trend develop s and Texas falls apart the rest of the season there will be a fair question about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his teams head screwe d on straight But its typical after losses to want to shred every part of t he team Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong the quarterback situation would be blamed And he was right The QBs are still working hard and look for Simms to start this week against Houston There s no question that the Oline is struggling but so are the backs and so are the receivers Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the line He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between Applewhite and the receivers causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford so it was taking him too long to get to the holes The coaches were not happy about that They were yelling at him to move up He should only be yards deep But he was sometimes at yards Mitchell also struggled with some blitz pickup which is uncharacteristic of him So look for Victor Ike Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston Coaches are still high on Jammer Again he hasnt played corner much in games after moving from safety But coaches are not thinking of moving him The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl Reese He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl e who can really play Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford B ut that position still needs a lot of work The blocked punt occurred because one player who blocked perfectly on other punts Saturday night failed to block a player coming right up the middle which guarantees doom That play er has been chewed out every which way As far as the penalties there were several questionable calls But Brow n who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game couldnt sa y anything about it after the game because he would be fined Texas can still have a good season and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so early will help in that direction Well see if Texas takes this loss constructively or destructively Q Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding I know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in the country in Ive waited all offseason to see him explode against teams this year I havent seen it yet Maybe this week against Stanford M y question is why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized and average Is Texas that low on defensive line talent It seems our recruiting has been great Please help me understand Hook em Horns Ernie McAnally BROWN Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov e But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel d right away as a defensive end Coaches also feel that his body i s perfect for the DE position Hes tall athletic fast and has long arms I n time coaches feel Redding will develop into an AllAmerica player But the re is no question that he has struggled against the run He made some big play s against Stanford recording six tackles three of them for losses and blocking an extra point attempt He is just a sophomore Over this season a nd the next two years he should only get better Q I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the announcers stated that TCU had anted up for the Heisman campaign f or LaDainian Tomlinson How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky Williams run for the Heisman BROWN Texas didnt spend that much money at all They produced a few postcards a video and a CDROM screen saver to send out to the national media detailing Rickys accomplishments But those costs totaled less than according to UT officials Q Did any of the freshman who did not play in the LouisianaLafayette game play in the Stanford game I am watching to see which ones might be redshirts Mike Smith Houston BROWN According to the participation chart provided at the StanfordT exas game Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh o did not play against LouisianaLafayette In addition to Sendlein here are the other freshmen who have played so far WRs Roy Williams BJ Johnson a nd Sloan Thomas TE Brock Edwards DE Kalen Thornton CB Nathan Vasher FS Phillip Geiggar and DT Stevie Lee Q Is it true that in Mack Browns four or five head coaching stops hi s teams have yet to win a single conference championship Since UT has lost four out of its last five games wouldnt a loss to Houston this week officially end Mack Browns honeymoon with the alumni notwithstanding his abundant PR program With Brown about to land his third national Top recruiting class I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie s to go with those recruiting victories T Hough BROWN Its true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i n stints at Appalachian State Tulane North Carolina and now Texas At Appalachian State Tulane and UNC he was taking over absolutely dead programs He took Tulane to a bowl and he had Florida State to deal with i n the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC But he took UNC to six bowl gam es in his years at UNC and won four of them A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas faithful But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha s done beating Nebraska twice Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce in hi s first two seasons here He has also turned Texas back into a destination school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together In addition to all that he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha n probably most Texas fans realize Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden John Cooper Lloyd C arr Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t he eyes of fans It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha t UNC fans were pretty hohum about everything the Tar Heels did in football even when they won big Brown wanted to win at a school with huge expectations Hell have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti ng out the next few seasons in the Top Q Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game Marty Bonner BROWN Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe red against Stanford He may also miss the Oklahoma State game Mack Brown said this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball really well Q Is Ricky Williams jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S ept Mark Wilson BROWN Yes Williams No will be retired at that game Williams ha s said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th at will be available soon Q What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after the loss to Stanford Virginia Blair BROWN Again here are Macks words I said during the preseason tha t we were overrated I didnt see any reason with the youth the way we finished last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a Top football team One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv e a tremendous amount of attention and publicity but in some cases people wa nt to push you too fast to get to the top I think that we were in that positi on and expectations got out of hand I knew that we would have a

Victor Guggenheim PM To Phillip M CT Darron C CT Jackson CT cc Subject FW Does your school qualify A school either is or it isnt Alabama is Notre Dame is Ohio State is Michigan is Texas is USC is Missouri thinks it is but is not Minnesota was but is no longer Wisconsin just discovered what the meaning of is is Rice never was and Temple will never ever be We have gathered here to establish what is required to be a college football program Mind you this is more than an empirical hashing of wins and losses Colorado won a national title in but is not a program Ohio State has not won one since but is Determining what constitutes a program is tricky business as much about feel and intuition as it is churning out NFL talent Can we whistle your fight song Can mere mention of your school start a bar fight Does your school consider it a moral imperative to keep expanding stadium capacity so as to annually lead the NCAA in attendance Do we need a tow truck to haul your media guide from the mailbox to the front door If you answered yes yes yes and yes to the above you are likely a program You have a far better chance of achieving program status if you tee it up in the South where the War of Northern Aggression has provided more than four score and seven years worth of motivation When Georgia program beat Michigan program at Ann Arbor in fans deluged the Bulldogs upon their return to Athens It was as if we had a chance to go to Gettysburg again former Georgia coach Vince Dooley says of that victory in Tony Barnharts new book Southern Fried Football What does it take to make our varsity National titles factor in and tradition is a must but there is much more to it than that A program must go the extra yard Any school willing buy out a head coachs contract no matter the length or the amount is a program Any school that keeps recruiting a player it cant get just to keep a rival schools top recruiter on the case is a program You probably also qualify if The square footage of your schools weight room is roughly equal to that of your towns municipal airport You think the man scholarship limit is a communist plot You contribute money to only two sports football and spring football You publicly support Title IX but privately think it has set your boys back years Hollywood has made a movie involving the program Rudy Big Chill Something For Joey Everybodys AllAmerican The Spirit of West Point Hold em Navy The Bear Knute Rockne All American Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Your school annually ranks in the preseason top no matter how many starters it has coming back Your head coach could run for Congress and win in a landslide They name city streets after your coaches and players The chief of police keeps mug photos of your players in his top drawer Your head coach leads practice with a megaphone from a tower You have a living mascot UGA Mike the Tiger Bevo although this does not guarantee enshrinement see Ralphie at Colorado To what length will you go for your program Will one of your players come off the bench to tackle an opponent running free down the sideline a la Alabamas Tommy Lewis against Rices Dickie Moegle in the Cotton Bowl Are you arrogant enough pay attention here USC and Notre Dame to keep scheduling top opponents because you believe in your heart you are one national television victory from getting back in title contention You get program bonus points if you had a coach or player nicknamed Shug Bump Rip Gus Bear Bubba Duffy Muddy Notable exceptions Orin Babe Hollingbery at Washington State and Texas El Pasos Cactus Jack Curtice You are a program if you can overlook your head coachs scandalous extramarital affair as long as he defeats Auburn You are probably a program if youve had or fewer coaches in the last years Since for example Penn State has employed only Rip Engle and Joe Paterno who have amassed a combined record of Penn State is a program Lastly and this is very importantit can make or break a program Are you willing to accept NCAA sanctions as a reasonable condition for winning a national title This factor alone tipped the University of Washington off the program fence You are likely not a program if You produce boatloads of NFL players but cant sell out home games You sell your tickets to the Rose Bowl when your team is in it Your marching band is banned from playing at a game but your team isnt You sell your home game to an opponent for financial considerations Your arena is named after a basketball coach but the football stadium is named after a philanthropist You play in a conference that ends with any combination of the letters U S and A You play in a domed stadium Your most famous football player made his name in baseball You ripped your fight song off from Nebraska and changed the words The list Program note If your school is not among the following you are most likely a rat for the NCAA The Programs NOTRE DAME The whole nine yards Equal parts love hate hype history myth combined now with firstever NCAA sanctions They ought to make several movies ALABAMA Bear Bryant left Texas AM program in to return to Tuscaloosa Asked why Bear said Mama called MICHIGAN You are a program when your Sept game at UCLA can be written off as a West Coast recruiting trip NEBRASKA The American Gothic of programs The media guide cover could be a standing shot of a plow pitchfork

looking at again Keep reading to the bottom of the page dont stop at the feetYoull see THINGS ARENT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the mansions guest room Instead the angels were given a small space in the cold basement As they made their bed on the hard floor the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it When the younger angel asked why the older angel replied Things arent always what they seem The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor but very hospitable farmer and his wife After sharing what little food they had the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good nights rest When the sun came up the next morning the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears Their only cow whose milk had been their sole income lay dead in the field The younger angel was infuriated and asked the older angel How could you have let this happen The first man had everything yet you helped him she accused The second family had little but was willing to share everything and you let the cow die Things arent always what they seem the older angel replied When we stayed in the basement of the mansion I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall Since the owner was so obsessed with greed and unwilling to share his good fortune I sealed the wall so he wouldnt find it Then last night as we slept in the farmers bed the angel of death came for his wife I gave him the cow instead Things arent always what they seem Sometimes that is exactly what happens when things dont turn out the way they should If you have faith you just need to trust that every outcome is always to your advantage You might not know it until some time later Oooo Some people come into our lives and quickly go oooO Some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful Oooo footprints on our hearts oooO and we are
