Andrea CT cc Subject Fwd FW Advice on SelfDefense I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH SOLID INFORMATION Hi ladies I just finished taking the most amazing selfdefense class sponsored by Shandwick and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail bun braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for women whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one place women are abducted fromattacked at is grocery store parking lots Number two is office parking lotsgarages Number three is public rest rooms The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they dont have to worry about getting caught Only said they carried weapons because rape carries a year sentence but rape with a weapon is years If you put up any kind of a fight at all they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isnt worth it because it will be timeconsuming These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas or other similar objects that can be used from a distance in their hands Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life picpcx picpcx,ring-a,

nronXgate Andrea CT cc Subject FW weepy Choices At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learningdisabled children the father of one of the schools students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question Everything God does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is Gods plan in reflected in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believethe father answered that when God brings a child like Shay into the world an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself And it comes in the way people treat that child Then he told the following story Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think they will let me play Shays father knew that most boys would not want him on their team But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates Getting none he took matters into his own hands and said We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three At the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Although no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base Shay was scheduled to be the next atbat Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field far beyond reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay was rounding first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag But the right fielder understood what the pitchers intentions had been so he threw the ball high and far over the third basemans head Shay ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home As Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned him in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay Run home Shay ran home stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero for hitting a grand slam and winning the game for his team That day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his facethe boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world And now a footnote to the story We all send thousands of jokes through email without a second thought but when it comes to sending messages regarding life choices people think twice about sharing The crude vulgar and sometimes the obscene pass freely through

nronXgate Andrea CT cc Subject FW weepy Choices At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learningdisabled children the father of one of the schools students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question Everything God does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is Gods plan in reflected in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believethe father answered that when God brings a child like Shay into the world an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself And it comes in the way people treat that child Then he told the following story Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think they will let me play Shays father knew that most boys would not want him on their team But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates Getting none he took matters into his own hands and said We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three At the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Although no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base Shay was scheduled to be the next atbat Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field far beyond reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay was rounding first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag But the right fielder understood what the pitchers intentions had been so he threw the ball high and far over the third basemans head Shay ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home As Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned him in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay Run home Shay ran home stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero for hitting a grand slam and winning the game for his team That day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his facethe boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world And now a footnote to the story We all send thousands of jokes

nronXgate Andrea CT cc Subject FW weepy Choices At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learningdisabled children the father of one of the schools students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question Everything God does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is Gods plan in reflected in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believethe father answered that when God brings a child like Shay into the world an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself And it comes in the way people treat that child Then he told the following story Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think they will let me play Shays father knew that most boys would not want him on their team But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates Getting none he took matters into his own hands and said We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three At the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Although no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base Shay was scheduled to be the next atbat Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field far beyond reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay was rounding first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag But the right fielder understood what the pitchers intentions had been so he threw the ball high and far over the third basemans head Shay ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home As Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned him in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay Run home Shay ran home stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero for hitting a grand slam and winning the game for his team That day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his facethe boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world And now a footnote to the story We all send thousands of jokes

Andrea CT cc Subject Fwd FW Advice on SelfDefense I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH SOLID INFORMATION Hi ladies I just finished taking the most amazing selfdefense class sponsored by Shandwick and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail bun braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for women whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one place women are abducted fromattacked at is grocery store parking lots Number two is office parking lotsgarages Number three is public rest rooms The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they dont have to worry about getting caught Only said they carried weapons because rape carries a year sentence but rape with a weapon is years If you put up any kind of a fight at all they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isnt worth it because it will be timeconsuming These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas or other similar objects that can be used from a distance in their hands Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life picpcx picpcx,ring-a,

Andrea CT cc Subject Fwd FW Advice on SelfDefense I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH SOLID INFORMATION Hi ladies I just finished taking the most amazing selfdefense class sponsored by Shandwick and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail bun braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for women whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one place women are abducted fromattacked at is grocery store parking lots Number two is office parking lotsgarages Number three is public rest rooms The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they dont have to worry about getting caught Only said they carried weapons because rape carries a year sentence but rape with a weapon is years If you put up any kind of a fight at all they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isnt worth it because it will be timeconsuming These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas or other similar objects that can be used from a distance in their hands Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life picpcx picpcx,ring-a,

nronXgate Andrea CT cc Subject FW weepy Choices At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learningdisabled children the father of one of the schools students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question Everything God does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is Gods plan in reflected in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believethe father answered that when God brings a child like Shay into the world an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself And it comes in the way people treat that child Then he told the following story Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think they will let me play Shays father knew that most boys would not want him on their team But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates Getting none he took matters into his own hands and said We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three At the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Although no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base Shay was scheduled to be the next atbat Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field far beyond reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay was rounding first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag But the right fielder understood what the pitchers intentions had been so he threw the ball high and far over the third basemans head Shay ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home As Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned him in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay Run home Shay ran home stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero for hitting a grand slam and winning the game for his team That day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his facethe boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world And now a footnote to the story We all send thousands of jokes

nronXgate Andrea CT cc Subject FW weepy Choices At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learningdisabled children the father of one of the schools students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended After extolling the school and its dedicated staff he offered a question Everything God does is done with perfection Yet my son Shay cannot learn things as other children do He cannot understand things as other children do Where is Gods plan in reflected in my son The audience was stilled by the query The father continued I believethe father answered that when God brings a child like Shay into the world an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself And it comes in the way people treat that child Then he told the following story Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball Shay asked Do you think they will let me play Shays father knew that most boys would not want him on their team But the father understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a muchneeded sense of belonging Shays father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play The boy looked around for guidance from his teammates Getting none he took matters into his own hands and said We are losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning I guess he can be on our team and well try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning In the bottom of the eighth inning Shays team scored a few runs but was still behind by three At the top of the ninth inning Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield Although no hits came his way he was obviously ecstatic just to be on the field grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands In the bottom of the ninth inning Shays team scored again Now with two outs and the bases loaded the potential winning run was on base Shay was scheduled to be the next atbat Would the team actually let Shay bat at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game Surprisingly Shay was given the bat Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didnt even know how to hold the bat properly much less connect with the ball However as Shay stepped up to the plate the pitcher moved a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward Shay As the pitch came in Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball to the pitcher The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the ball to the first baseman Shay would have been out and that would have ended the game Instead the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high arc to right field far beyond reach of the first baseman Everyone started yelling Shay run to first Run to first Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base He scampered down the baseline wideeyed and startled Everyone yelled Run to second run to second By the time Shay was rounding first base the right fielder had the ball He could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag But the right fielder understood what the pitchers intentions had been so he threw the ball high and far over the third basemans head Shay ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home As Shay reached second base the opposing shortstop ran to him turned him in the direction of third base and shouted Run to third As Shay rounded third the boys from both teams were screaming Shay Run home Shay ran home stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero for hitting a grand slam and winning the game for his team That day said the father softly with tears now rolling down his facethe boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this world And now a footnote to the story We all send thousands of jokes through email without a second thought but when it comes to sending messages regarding life choices people think twice about sharing The crude vulgar and sometimes the obscene pass freely through cyberspace but public discussion of decency is too often suppressed in school and the workplace If you are thinking about forwarding this message you are probably thinking about which people on your address list arent the appropriate ones to receive this type of message The person who sent this to you believes that we can all make a difference We all have thousands of opportunities a day to help realize Gods plan So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice Do we pass along a spark of the Divine Or do we pass up that opportunity and leave the world a bit colder in the process You have two choices now Delete this Forward it to the people you care about You know the choice I made,ring-a,

Andrea CT cc Subject Fwd FW Advice on SelfDefense I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH SOLID INFORMATION Hi ladies I just finished taking the most amazing selfdefense class sponsored by Shandwick and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped He started a womens group and began teaching these classes soon after This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall He and the others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in prison on what they look for and heres some interesting facts The thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail bun braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair Women with short hair are not common targets The second thing men look for is clothing They will look for women whos clothing is easy to remove quickly The outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut They also look for women on their cell phone searching through their purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off guard and can be easily overpowered The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is in the early morning between and am The number one place women are abducted fromattacked at is grocery store parking lots Number two is office parking lotsgarages Number three is public rest rooms The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman and quickly move her to a second location where they dont have to worry about getting caught Only said they carried weapons because rape carries a year sentence but rape with a weapon is years If you put up any kind of a fight at all they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isnt worth it because it will be timeconsuming These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas or other similar objects that can be used from a distance in their hands Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon So the idea is to convince these guys youre not worth it Several defense mechanisms he taught us are If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage or with you in an elevator or stairwell look them in the face and ask them a question like what time is it or make general small talk I cant believe it is so cold out here were in for a bad winter Now youve seen their face and could identify them in a lineup you lose appeal as a target If someone is coming toward you hold out your hands in front of you and yell Stop or Stay back Most of the rapists this man talked to said theyd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed that she would not be afraid to fight back Again they are looking for an EASY target If you carry pepper spray this instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him wherever he goes yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it out will be a deterrent If someone grabs you you cant beat them with strength but you can by outsmarting them If they grab your wrist pull your wrist back so your hand is in waving position palm facing forward and twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away It is hard to hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way They stumble toward you and you stumble back so you can use that momentum to bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the forehead nose or teeth If you are grabbed around the waist from behind pinch the attacker either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper inner thigh HARD One woman in a class this guy taught told him she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle strands the guy needed stitches Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it It hurts After the initial hit always go for the groin I know from a particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guys balls sorry to be graphic it is extremely painful You might think that youll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more but the thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman who will not cause a lot of trouble Start causing trouble and hes out of there When the guy puts his hands up to you grab his first two fingers and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing down on them as possible The instructor did it to me without using much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked audibly Of course the things we always hear still apply Always be aware of your surroundings take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior dont dismiss it go with your instincts You may feel a little silly at the time but youd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble Please forward this to any woman you know its simple stuff that could save her life picpcx picpcx,ring-a,
