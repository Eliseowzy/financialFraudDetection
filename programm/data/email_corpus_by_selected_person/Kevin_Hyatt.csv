Jeffery Fawcett PM To Steven HarrisET NRON cc Kevin HyattET nron Subject Electric Developments I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your question as well as the questions raised in Drews email Heres what we found out Steves question What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico maybe MW and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California What youre really asking here is What are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline In this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilities the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and environmental and other permitting considerations Engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to MMmile to construct turnkey This figure is comparable to the MMmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter highpressure steel pipeline In terms of operating costs for anything over miles in length there are three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation loss radiation loss EFM and heat loss across the conductors A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is This number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on Transwesterns pipeline The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting There just arent many new transmission lines being approved It was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from to years to secure authorization The issues of electromagnetic field EMF radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway In short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure Drews questions What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant For purposes of this exercise Im assuming were talking gasfired generation Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant Market area demand distributive andor Transmission access to market Water rights for turbine cooling Ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction Proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are Order tariffs pretty much the same all over FERC Order and require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under FERC Order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines Its pretty obvious from the California example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of Independent System Operators ISOs there is substantial room for improvement and possible further FERC involvement In the open access final rule Order No the Commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service All public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases Order No also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately In my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy For example in the past weve seen Calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its IPP projects In the mid to late s during the build out of several QFs cogens Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project In todays market Calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from Statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western US power projects In other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project In short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFPs for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala Calpine What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Last December the FERC issued Order No a final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs Order builds on the foundation of Orders and issued in According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker Order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants Therefore Order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in Orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation The order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation The Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems FERC believes that regardless of format RTOs will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary RTO formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives Order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational RTO Moreover Order does not compel any transmission owner to join an RTO but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts As to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning RTO network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders As FERC reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system Therefore the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure Unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals Has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market Natural gas prices of MMBtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel In the Western US marketplace particularly in California I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation Renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a MMBtu price Moreover California environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible While demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power As to the final point Im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel Steven Harris AM To Kevin HyattET nron cc Jeffery FawcettET NRON Subject Re Electric Developments Since you are the expert in this area I need to know what economics would determine if

transport agreements K with Citizens Utility Under the interconnect agreement Citizens has to be able to take a min and max pressure of psig from TW The good news is as follows Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point poi to MMBtud effective and only d from This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct thru Mar What this means to TWENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES So any volume TW delivers for EES up to the capacity max on the lateral d should not impare deliveries to Citizens I have a question for Fac Planning does the Flagstaff NE POI lie on the same lateral If it does then Citizens has MMBtud for and MMBtud for also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need Let me know if you have questions kh Original Message From Faucheaux Eric Sent Monday June AM To Ramsaran Gale Cc Hyatt Kevin Gottsponer Morgan Subject FW Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Gale here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of MMcfd to ENA for power generating The problem is that the lateral capacity is about MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point but Citizens has about MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point Kevin is checking on this however I dont believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point two regulators can do more than MMcfd my intuitive guess needs to be checked or verified Pressure TW may be between psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca Citizens pressure is reported to be around psig downstream of control valves The greatest daily volume MN since Jan was Mcf on Jan as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas data The flow graph on Jan also obtained from MIPS is shown below File MNdailyvolxls Planning Question if Citizens meter capacity is say MMcfd at some pressure can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA What would new pressure conditions look like flowing MMcfd through the lateral Original Message From Eric Faucheaux Sent Thursday May PM To Eric Faucheaux Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Forwarded by Eric FaucheauxETSEnron on PM From David Roensch PM To Eric FaucheauxETSEnron Rich JollyET nron mailtoJollyET nron cc Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Eric Im going to try an provide the info requested this morning This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions The following are the details as I understand it The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points The other two interconnect points are Citizens FA interconnect In Flagstaff and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman Again one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points The total nomination is not to exceed mmcfd This mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point I hope that made sense So with that said as I understand it we must maintain the ability to provide mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery We have approximately miles of lateral from Transwesterns mainline feeding this interconnect Once at the metering station we have a auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree See chart below Please see drawing Flagstaff Lateral ICCUABA for details of meter station yard and piping Once the gas flows out of the turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater Citizens piping begins Citizens has ea regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail I know that pressure profiles in Section will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the Lateral would be but System Ops should be able to provide this info on a bestworst case senario both pre and post Red Rock Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station I would assume Flow Capacity Info for a Auto Adjust Turbine Meter Pressure Max Flow Rate mscfd mscfd mscfd mscfd The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated I hope this answered some of your questions It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning System Ops Marketing Engineering and Operations to discuss the details

Hass Glen SentFriday March AM ToHyatt Kevin SubjectACC approval FYIDidnt know if you were tracking this plant but thought you find the ACC decision of interest gh COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT Requires Use of Solor Technology Groundwater Monitoring Program PHOENIX In a decision yesterday the Arizona Corporation Commission appro ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas tern Arizona The project to be constructed in two megawatt phases is a watercooled power plant using a maximum of acrefeet of groundwat er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output Sout hWestern Power Group II is the project developer The approval requires Sou thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p ower block This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project Merchant powe r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers D uring Tuesdays meeting the Commission accepted the restrictions placed on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com mittee After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox communities the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission er Spitzer The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa ter table Summary of the Spitzer Amendment The amendment requires SouthWe stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria Once the pro ject is operating the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual contributions of to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the fund reaches a balance of Any business or individual who can pro ve through successful arbitration that groundwater pumping has caused pro perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of in th e fund Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi e the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S upervisors The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned Commissi oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti ng impact of the power project I proposed this amendment to answer the co ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district Commissioner Marc Spitzer said Although we heard testimony that the power plants grou ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed I dont think you can be too careful Were making decisions that could affect an economical ly depressed area for generations to come Other Environmental Conditions Twentytwo conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis sion Line Siting Committee They include Establishment of a monitoring p roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori ng Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping Cracks f issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep underground that provided physical support is no longer there Contribut ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou s materials training for firefighters Making arrangements with local law enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses by local law enforcement This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner Jim Irvin Prior to construction of the facility SouthWestern must provi de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of its output on reliable operation of the electric grid Conditions requir ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res ources Additionally the applicant will have to participate in and comply with all standards for safe reliable power delivery I was pleased to sup port this project in part because it includes solar technology as a key co mponent of the whole project The level of support from the local community was also impressive Les Thompson Chairman of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A rizona community Chairman Bill Mundell explained The residents and busi ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi ts of having the power plant in their community Additionally the project will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and ulti mately the or people needed to run the plant Commissioner Irvin vo ted in favor of the project saying I do believe the need for this projec t was established in the record Further I believe the project is in the p ublic interest and meets the balancing test He was referring to the sitin g statute that requires the Commission to balance in the broad public int erest the need for an adequate economical and reliable supply of electric power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an d ecology of this state Arizona Revised Statutes subsection B For more information about recent power plant sitings visit the Arizo

dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price including the KRGT expansion The sale not only helps WPLs current finances but eliminates the need to spend bn on the expansion Whats interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when its over kh Original Message From Fawcett Jeffery mailto empracom Sent Friday March PM To Lindberg Lorraine Huckabee Phyllis Hyatt Kevin Subject Kern River deal Wow this is huge Ive met with executives of MidAmerican Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didnt come away too terribly impressed Its undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant David Sokol both have a reputation for finding ways to make money but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of MidAmerican that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world Jeff ps While at Mojave Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas controloperations puke like the rest of us Hes apparently done quite well at KRGT Williams to sell Kern River for nearly B Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings for nearly billion MidAmerican a unit of investor Warren Buffets Berkshire Hathaway will pay Williams million in cash and assume million of Williams debt in order to acquire Kern River The deal part of Williams ongoing effort to strengthen its balance sheet is set to close by March assuming regulatory approvals Williams said selling the Kern River system will save the company about billion in capital expenses over the next months MidAmerican meanwhile said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline which currently has a capacity of Mcfday and extends miles from Opal Wyo to Californias San Joaquin Valley Built in it is a key route for shipping Rocky Mountain gas to markets in the western United States particularly Southern California The expansion project due to be completed in May will more than double the pipelines capacity to Bcfday according to a filing Williams submitted to FERC in August The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed billion MidAmerican said in a release We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission which we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America said David Sokol MidAmericans chairman and CEO Upon completion of the sale Kern River will become a subsidiary of MidAmerican Bob Sluder senior vice president and general manager of Williams Kern River and Northwest systems will become president of the new MidAmerican subsidiary As for Williams We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies which now require companies like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating President and CEO Steve Malcolm said The sale of our Kern River system is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our businesses now and in the future Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsabased company delayed the release of its earnings to iron out debt issues related to the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary which it spun off last year Earlier this week Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance billion of WGCrelated debt GD Williams stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the heightened scrutiny of US energy merchant companies in the wake of Enrons bankruptcy in December GD In releasing its earnings Thursday Williams reported a net loss of million or share compared with net earnings of million or share in The loss includes pretax charges of billion relating to WGC WGC said income from continuing operations for was million compared with million a year earlier The total WCGrelated charges of billion represents of the total WCGrelated guarantees and payment obligations and the deferred payment for services provided to WCG Williams said Also Thursday Williams said it will raise million through the sale of cumulative convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings MEHC will acquire million shares of the security at a price of share with each share of the security convertible into shares of Williams stock The deal is expected to close by March and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction MidAmerican headquartered in Des Moines Iowa is a privately owned energy provider with employees It provides gas and

EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHOS HAD ENOUGH You really want to figure us out Heres a start Learn to work the toilet seat If its up put it down We need it up you need it down You dont hear us gripping about you leaving it down do you No of course not That would be stupid and there are far more important things to be worried about You dont try to sit in the drivers seat without opening the dammed car door do you If you wont dress like the Victorias Secret girls dont expect us to act like soap opera guys If you think youre fat you probably are Dont ask us Its a stupid question and we refuse to answer Dont cut your hair Ever Long hair is always more attractive than short hair Period One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair and by then youre stuck with her Birthdays Valentines and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again Heres a real easy one If you ask a question you dont want an answer to expect an answer you dont want to hear Asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to and then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite direction is a really stupid thing to do Sometimes were not thinking about you Live with it Dont ask us what were thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint the shotgun formation or monster trucks Sunday Sports Its like the full moon or the changing of the tides Let it be Shopping is not a sport and no were never going to think of it that way When we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine Really You have enough clothes You have too many shoes Crying is blackmail and you know it Knock it off Lets be clear on this one Ask for what you want I repeat ask for what you want Subtle hints dont work Strong hints dont work Really obvious hints dont work Just say it No your having to ask for something does NOT automatically make it not worth getting If it did you might as well give back the car the house and that last raise you got And NO trying to punish us by acting like you dont want the thing seconds after you were compelled to ask for it will not teach us a lesson or jumpstart the ESP gland within our underdeveloped craniums Heres the math write it down somewhereASK GETNO ASK NO GET No we dont know what day it is We never will Mark anniversaries on the calendar Peeing standing up is more difficult Were bound to miss sometimes Most guys own three pairs of shoes What makes you think wed be any good at choosing which pair out of thirty would look good with your dress Whether or not you believe it yes and no are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question Come to us with a problem if you want help solving it Thats what we do Occasionally we can go out on a limb and attempt to empathize However be warned that approaching us with a problem without clearly indicating which you want solutions or empathy will likely result in you getting neither Tricky system but thats just the way it works Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for A headache that lasts for months is a medical problem See a doctor Foreign films are best left to foreigners Unless its Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan where it doesnt really matter what theyre saying Check your oil If we tell you that you look beautiful at in the morning or any other time when you are dirty mussed up or otherwise not perfectly coiffed we really do mean it Telling us that we dont really pisses us off and further decreases the likelihood of your hearing anything of the sort when you are fishing for compliments It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together No it doesnt matter which quiz Anything we said months ago is inadmissible in an argument All comments become null and void after days If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry we meant the other one Let us ogle stare Were going to look anyway its genetic and we know you do it too You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something but not both Whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during commercials If it itches it will be scratched If we ask whats wrong and you say nothing we will act like nothings wrong If we ask and you say that something is wrong we would greatly appreciate your helping us out by actually telling us what it is before our aforementioned inability to read minds once again quickly takes the place of the actual issue at hand When we are with the guys or watching sports or both we are bound to look say do or act stupid It doesnt bother us It shouldnt bother you Thank you for reading this Yes I know I have to sleep on the couch tonight We really dont mind that though its kind of like camping and

RitcheyET NRON Rod WilliamsET NRON Kenneth MillerET NRON cc Subject FOXSportscoms Nebraskas Option Will Blast Through Attacking Defenses Runs of steel Nebraskas option will blast through attacking defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history But come January Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack Senior writer Darryl Richards

defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the

defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history But come January Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack Senior writer Darryl Richards

They hold MMBtud from Thoreau to Needles expiring and from Blanco to Thoreau expiring We will post the capacity for five business days ending Monday at pm because the replacing contract is for term

operator Included in their storage facilities is Wild Goose Storage near Gridley California north of Sacramento They are currently connected to PGE and are marketing an open season to expand the facility from bcf to bcf in service date of April They are asking for minimum year term commitments at rack rates awarded by net present value This may be an opportunity for Transwestern to indirectly

management on Monday to expand its Line capacity at Needles by MMcfd The mm expansion requires the installation of a hp electric compressor SoCal Gas intends only to notify the CPUC of its planned construction but will not seek CPUC approval to include the cost of these new facilities in rates SoCal Gas believes it can have the new facilities in place within months TW will continue discussions with SoCal Gas to identify additional projects to further increase takeaway capacity beyond the MMcfd contemplated in this first expansion Agave TW and Agave field personnel are evaluating some valve and compressor reconfigurations that may allow Agave to move up to MMBtud across the LECAtoka line The changes would enable high pressure field gas to avoid being compressed into the low pressure side of the Atoka lateral We are also considering installing a tap and meter to move some Agave gas into the DukeCrawford system Duke would then redeliver the volume into the high pressure side of the West Texas lateral Because the gas would be moving off TW into Duke then back into TW it could subject Duke to regulation under the Natural Gas Act Duke is aware of the risk and is evaluating their

evaluating options to source supplies from areas other than Canada They would like a portion of Red Rock but require Needles delivery capacity which is fully subscribed through They are very

Jeffery Fawcett PM To Steven HarrisET NRON cc Kevin HyattET nron Subject Electric Developments I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your question as well as the questions raised in Drews email Heres what we found out Steves question What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico maybe MW and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California What youre really asking here is What are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline In this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilities the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and environmental and other permitting considerations Engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to MMmile to construct turnkey This figure is comparable to the MMmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter highpressure steel pipeline In terms of operating costs for anything over miles in length there are three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation loss radiation loss EFM and heat loss across the conductors A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is This number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on Transwesterns pipeline The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting There just arent many new transmission lines being approved It was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from to years to secure authorization The issues of electromagnetic field EMF radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofway In short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure Drews questions What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant For purposes of this exercise Im assuming were talking gasfired generation Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant Market area demand distributive andor Transmission access to market Water rights for turbine cooling Ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction Proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are Order tariffs pretty much the same all over FERC Order and require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under FERC Order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines Its pretty obvious from the California example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of Independent System Operators ISOs there is substantial room for improvement and possible further FERC involvement In the open access final rule Order No the Commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service All public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases Order No also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately In my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy For example in the past weve seen Calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its IPP projects In the mid to late s during the build out of several QFs cogens Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project In todays market Calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from Statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western US power projects In other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project In short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFPs for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala Calpine What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Last December the FERC issued Order No a final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs Order builds on the foundation of Orders and issued in According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker Order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants Therefore Order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in Orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation The order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation The Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems FERC believes that regardless of format RTOs will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary RTO formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives Order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational RTO Moreover Order does not compel any transmission owner to join an RTO but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts As to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning RTO network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders As FERC reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system Therefore the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure Unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals Has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market Natural gas prices of MMBtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel In the Western US marketplace particularly in California I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation Renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a MMBtu price Moreover California environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible While demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power As to the final point Im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel Steven Harris AM To Kevin HyattET nron cc Jeffery FawcettET NRON Subject Re Electric Developments Since you are the expert in this area I need to know what economics would determine if

separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under FERC Order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines Its pretty obvious from the California example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of Independent System Operators ISOs there is substantial room for improvement and possible further FERC involvement In the open access final rule Order No the Commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service All public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases Order No also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately In my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy For example in the past weve seen Calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its IPP projects In the mid to late s during the build out of several QFs cogens Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project In todays market Calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from Statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western US power projects In other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project In short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFPs for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala Calpine What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Last December the FERC issued Order No a final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations RTOs Order builds on the foundation of Orders and issued in According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker Order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants Therefore Order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in Orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation The order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation The Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to FERC jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems FERC believes that regardless of format RTOs will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary RTO formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives Order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational RTO Moreover Order does not compel any transmission owner to join an RTO but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts As to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning RTO network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders As FERC reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system Therefore the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure Unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals Has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market Natural gas prices of MMBtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel In the Western US marketplace particularly in California I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation Renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a MMBtu price Moreover California environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible While demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power As to the final point Im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel Steven Harris AM To Kevin HyattET nron cc Jeffery FawcettET NRON Subject Re Electric Developments Since you are the expert in this area I need to know what economics would determine if

developments in electric markets and NNs and TWs efforts to attract power generation load to the system Specific topics I hope to cover include the following What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plant Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are Order tariffs pretty much the same all over How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separately What is the RTO Rule and why should we care Has mmbtu gas

transport agreements K with Citizens Utility Under the interconnect agreement Citizens has to be able to take a min and max pressure of psig from TW The good news is as follows Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point poi to MMBtud effective and only d from This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct thru Mar What this means to TWENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES So any volume TW delivers for EES up to the capacity max on the lateral d should not impare deliveries to Citizens I have a question for Fac Planning does the Flagstaff NE POI lie on the same lateral If it does then Citizens has MMBtud for and MMBtud for also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need Let me know if you have questions kh Original Message From Faucheaux Eric Sent Monday June AM To Ramsaran Gale Cc Hyatt Kevin Gottsponer Morgan Subject FW Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Gale here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of MMcfd to ENA for power generating The problem is that the lateral capacity is about MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point but Citizens has about MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point Kevin is checking on this however I dont believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point two regulators can do more than MMcfd my intuitive guess needs to be checked or verified Pressure TW may be between psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca Citizens pressure is reported to be around psig downstream of control valves The greatest daily volume MN since Jan was Mcf on Jan as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas data The flow graph on Jan also obtained from MIPS is shown below File MNdailyvolxls Planning Question if Citizens meter capacity is say MMcfd at some pressure can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA What would new pressure conditions look like flowing MMcfd through the lateral Original Message From Eric Faucheaux Sent Thursday May PM To Eric Faucheaux Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Forwarded by Eric FaucheauxETSEnron on PM From David Roensch PM To Eric FaucheauxETSEnron Rich JollyET nron mailtoJollyET nron cc Subject Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect Eric Im going to try an provide the info requested this morning This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions The following are the details as I understand it The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points The other two interconnect points are Citizens FA interconnect In Flagstaff and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman Again one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points The total nomination is not to exceed mmcfd This mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point I hope that made sense So with that said as I understand it we must maintain the ability to provide mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery We have approximately miles of lateral from Transwesterns mainline feeding this interconnect Once at the metering station we have a auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree See chart below Please see drawing Flagstaff Lateral ICCUABA for details of meter station yard and piping Once the gas flows out of the turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater Citizens piping begins Citizens has ea regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail I know that pressure profiles in Section will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the Lateral would be but System Ops should be able to provide this info on a bestworst case senario both pre and post Red Rock Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station I would assume Flow Capacity Info for a Auto Adjust Turbine Meter Pressure Max Flow Rate mscfd mscfd mscfd mscfd The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated I hope

Hass Glen SentFriday March AM ToHyatt Kevin SubjectACC approval FYIDidnt know if you were tracking this plant but thought you find the ACC decision of interest gh COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT Requires Use of Solor Technology Groundwater Monitoring Program PHOENIX In a decision yesterday the Arizona Corporation Commission appro ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas tern Arizona The project to be constructed in two megawatt phases is a watercooled power plant using a maximum of acrefeet of groundwat er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output Sout hWestern Power Group II is the project developer The approval requires Sou thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p ower block This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project Merchant powe r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers D uring Tuesdays meeting the Commission accepted the restrictions placed on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com mittee After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox communities the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission er Spitzer The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa ter table Summary of the Spitzer Amendment The amendment requires SouthWe stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria Once the pro ject is operating the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual contributions of to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the fund reaches a balance of Any business or individual who can pro ve through successful arbitration that groundwater pumping has caused pro perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of in th e fund Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi e the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S upervisors The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned Commissi oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti ng impact of the power project I proposed this amendment to answer the co ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district Commissioner Marc Spitzer said Although we heard testimony that the power plants grou ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed I dont think you can be too careful Were making decisions that could affect an economical ly depressed area for generations to come Other Environmental Conditions Twentytwo conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis sion Line Siting Committee They include Establishment of a monitoring p roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori ng Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping Cracks f issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep underground that provided physical support is no longer there Contribut ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou s materials training for firefighters Making arrangements with local law enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses by local law enforcement This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner Jim Irvin Prior to construction of the facility SouthWestern must provi de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of its output on reliable operation of the electric grid Conditions requir ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res ources Additionally the applicant will have to participate in and comply with all standards for safe reliable power delivery I was pleased to sup port this project in part because it includes solar technology as a key co mponent of the whole project The level of support from the local community was also impressive Les Thompson Chairman of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A rizona community Chairman Bill Mundell explained The residents and busi ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi ts of having the power plant in their community Additionally the project will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and ulti mately the or people needed to run the plant Commissioner Irvin vo ted in favor of the project saying I do believe the need for this projec t was established in the record Further I believe the project is in the p ublic interest and meets the balancing test He was referring to the sitin g statute that requires the Commission to balance in the broad public int erest the need for an adequate economical and reliable supply of electric power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an d ecology of this state Arizona Revised Statutes subsection B For more information about recent power plant sitings visit the Arizo

dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price including the KRGT expansion The sale not only helps WPLs current finances but eliminates the need to spend bn on the expansion Whats interesting is the preferred shares

Phyllis Hyatt Kevin Subject Kern River deal Wow this is huge Ive met with executives of MidAmerican Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didnt come away too terribly impressed Its undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant David Sokol both have a reputation for finding ways to make money but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of MidAmerican that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world Jeff ps While at Mojave Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas controloperations puke like the rest of us Hes apparently done quite well at KRGT Williams to sell Kern River for nearly B Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings for nearly billion MidAmerican a unit of investor Warren Buffets Berkshire Hathaway will pay Williams million in cash and assume million of Williams debt in order to acquire Kern River The deal part of Williams ongoing effort to strengthen its balance sheet is set to close by March assuming regulatory approvals Williams said selling the Kern River system will save the company about billion in capital expenses over the next months MidAmerican meanwhile said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline which currently has a capacity of Mcfday and extends miles from Opal Wyo to Californias San Joaquin Valley Built in it is a key route for shipping Rocky Mountain gas to markets in the western United States particularly Southern California The expansion project due to be completed in May will more than double the pipelines capacity to Bcfday according to a filing Williams submitted to FERC in August The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed billion MidAmerican said in a release We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission which we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America said David Sokol MidAmericans chairman and CEO Upon completion of the sale Kern River will become a subsidiary of MidAmerican Bob Sluder senior vice president and general manager of Williams Kern River and Northwest systems will become president of the new MidAmerican subsidiary As for Williams We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies which now require companies like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investmentgrade credit rating President and CEO Steve Malcolm said The sale of our Kern River system is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our businesses now and in the future Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsabased company delayed the release of its earnings to iron out debt issues related to the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary which it spun off last year Earlier this week Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance billion of WGCrelated debt GD Williams stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the heightened scrutiny of US energy merchant companies in the wake of Enrons bankruptcy in December GD In releasing its earnings Thursday Williams reported a net loss of million or share compared with net earnings of million or share in The loss includes pretax charges of billion relating to WGC WGC said income from continuing operations for was million compared with million a year earlier The total WCGrelated charges of billion represents of the total WCGrelated guarantees and payment obligations and the deferred payment for services provided to WCG Williams said Also Thursday Williams said it will raise million through the sale of cumulative convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings MEHC will acquire million shares of the security at a price of share with each share of the security convertible into shares of Williams stock The deal is expected to close by March and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction MidAmerican headquartered in Des Moines Iowa is a privately owned energy provider with employees It provides gas and

EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHOS HAD ENOUGH You really want to figure us out Heres a start Learn to work the toilet seat If its up put it down We need it up you need it down You dont hear us gripping about you leaving it down do you No of course not That would be stupid and there are far more important things to be worried about You dont try to sit in the drivers seat without opening the dammed car door do you If you wont dress like the Victorias Secret girls dont expect us to act like soap opera guys If you think youre fat you probably are Dont ask us Its a stupid question and we refuse to answer Dont cut your hair Ever Long hair is always more attractive than short hair Period One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair and by then youre stuck with her Birthdays Valentines and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again Heres a real easy one If you ask a question you dont want an answer to expect an answer you dont want to hear Asking opinionated questions that you already have an answer to and then getting pissed off because we gave our honest answer in the opposite direction is a really stupid thing to do Sometimes were not thinking about you Live with it Dont ask us what were thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint the shotgun formation or monster trucks Sunday Sports Its like the full moon or the changing of the tides Let it be Shopping is not a sport and no were never going to think of it that way When we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine Really You have enough clothes You have too many shoes Crying is blackmail and you know it Knock it off Lets be clear on this one Ask for what you want I repeat ask for what you want Subtle hints dont work Strong hints dont work Really obvious hints dont work Just say it No your having to ask for something does NOT automatically make it not worth getting If it did you might as well give back the car the house and that last raise you got And NO trying to punish us by acting like you dont want the thing seconds after you were compelled to ask for it will not teach us a lesson or jumpstart the ESP gland within our underdeveloped craniums Heres the math write it down somewhereASK GETNO ASK NO GET No we dont know what day it is We never will Mark anniversaries on the calendar Peeing standing up is more difficult Were bound to miss sometimes Most guys own three pairs of shoes What makes you think wed be any good at choosing which pair out of thirty would look good with your dress Whether or not you believe it yes and no are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question Come to us with a problem if you want help solving it Thats what we do Occasionally we can go out on a limb and attempt to empathize However be warned that approaching us with a problem without clearly indicating which you want solutions or empathy will likely result in you getting neither Tricky system but thats just the way it works Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for A headache that lasts for months is a medical problem See a doctor Foreign films are best left to foreigners Unless its Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan where it doesnt really matter what theyre saying Check your oil If we tell you that you look beautiful at in the morning or any other time when you are dirty mussed up or otherwise not perfectly coiffed we really do mean it Telling us that we dont really pisses us off and further decreases the likelihood of your hearing anything of the sort when you are fishing for compliments It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together No it doesnt matter which quiz Anything we said months ago is inadmissible in an argument All comments become null and void after days If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry we meant the other one Let us ogle stare Were going to look anyway its genetic and we know you do it too You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something but not both Whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during commercials If it itches it will be scratched If we ask whats wrong and you say nothing we will act like nothings wrong If we ask and you say that something is wrong we would greatly appreciate your helping us out by actually telling us what it is before our aforementioned inability to read minds once again quickly takes the place of the actual issue at hand When we are with the guys or watching sports or both we are bound to look say do or act stupid It doesnt bother us It shouldnt bother you Thank you for reading this Yes I know I have to sleep on the couch tonight We really dont mind that though its kind of like camping and

RitcheyET NRON Rod WilliamsET NRON Kenneth MillerET NRON cc Subject FOXSportscoms Nebraskas Option Will Blast Through Attacking Defenses Runs of steel Nebraskas option will blast through attacking defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history But come January Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack Senior writer Darryl Richards

RitcheyET NRON Rod WilliamsET NRON Kenneth MillerET NRON cc Subject FOXSportscoms Nebraskas Option Will Blast Through Attacking Defenses Runs of steel Nebraskas option will blast through attacking defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history But come January Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack Senior writer Darryl Richards

RitcheyET NRON Rod WilliamsET NRON Kenneth MillerET NRON cc Subject FOXSportscoms Nebraskas Option Will Blast Through Attacking Defenses Runs of steel Nebraskas option will blast through attacking defenses Jul pm ET BY DARRYL RICHARDS FOXSportscom The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas ic of offenses Call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d But when Nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses Teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in January That was Tennessees defense after the Cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks Sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year The answer is you dont Arguably the Cornhuskers FOXSportscoms No team in its preseason Top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season In their last five games the Cornhuskers beat Texas AM Kansas State Colorado Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of The scary thing about Nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again It starts in the offseason and continues through January The running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but Iback Dan Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season Even if the oftinjured Alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team Thunder Collins Nebraska will not only push other teams around The Cornhuskers will push themselves The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic Raiola for the Outland Trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an d September said Nebraska coach Frank Solich who has his best team since taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago We have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things We have high expectations Some of it comes from how we finished last season A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition The option and the Huskers are inextricably bound It is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators Yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years Nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span We try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt Solich said But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you Our players that are here love it It is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it Its what our players want to do on offense The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged Crouch can put his name up there with the Turner Gill Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if Crouch is hurt because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback The schedule has its pitfalls too Notre Dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie gets Nebraska at home on Sept A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska at their places Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike Brown But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense Polk is heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history But come January Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack Senior writer Darryl Richards

rate filings are on the docket for Wednesday March The possible outcomes include approval of the negotiated rates or reduction of the rate down to TWs max rate and refunding the difference back to the shippers or acceptance of the rates but directives to modify all future negotiations to some form of more standardarized rate calculation Conoco The shipper missed its ROFR notification last month They hold MMBtud from Thoreau to Needles expiring and from Blanco to Thoreau expiring We will post the capacity for five business days ending Monday at pm because the replacing contract is for term greater than year If other shippers come in with a request during the posting days capacity will need to be prorated or allocated in a lottery If requests come in after the posting days the space is sold first come first served for max rate bidders Mavrix is requesting this capacity through Alberta Energy Co AEC is Canadas largest gas producer and North Americas largest independent gas storage operator Included in their storage facilities is Wild Goose Storage near Gridley California north of Sacramento They are currently connected to PGE and are marketing an open season to expand the facility from bcf to bcf in service date of April They are asking for minimum year term commitments at rack rates awarded by net present value This may be an opportunity for Transwestern to indirectly have an option on storage or for Mavrix to directly lease storage SoCal Gas Needles Expansion TW met with SoCal Gas in Los Angeles on In this meeting SoCal Gas said it would be presenting a plan to management on Monday to expand its Line capacity at Needles by MMcfd The mm expansion requires the installation of a hp electric compressor SoCal Gas intends only to notify the CPUC of its planned construction but will not seek CPUC approval to include the cost of these new facilities in rates SoCal Gas believes it can have the new facilities in place within months TW will continue discussions with SoCal Gas to identify additional projects to further increase takeaway capacity beyond the MMcfd contemplated in this first expansion Agave TW and Agave field personnel are evaluating some valve and compressor reconfigurations that may allow Agave to move up to MMBtud across the LECAtoka line The changes would enable high pressure field gas to avoid being compressed into the low pressure side of the Atoka lateral We are also considering installing a tap and meter to move some Agave gas into the DukeCrawford system Duke would then redeliver the volume into the high pressure side of the West Texas lateral Because the gas would be moving off TW into Duke then back into TW it could subject Duke to regulation under the Natural Gas Act Duke is aware of the risk and is evaluating their strategy Lone Star LS Pipeline representatives were in the office this week in conjunction with Gas Fair We described the Red Rock project and the aptitude for producers on Lone Star to reach California markets Lone Star realizes they need to add compression to their system to access the West Texas lateral on a consistent basis They are evaluating their options including selling some underutilized pipe in west Texas They are sending us an updated system map to see if any asset synergies exist US Gypsum USG s energy management representatives from the Chicago headquarters came to Houston to discuss the Red Rock expansion The have four plants in California that consume a combined MMBtud off SoCal and PGE Their current transport contract with PGT expires April and they are evaluating options to source supplies from areas other than Canada They would like a portion of Red Rock but require Needles delivery capacity which is fully subscribed through They are very frustrated by the lack of response from their SoCal reps in coming up with a feasible solution to expanding Needles in the short term We told them we would keep them updated as our expansion conversations with SoCal progress Enron Energy Services EES Corporate Development is evaluating opportunities to install small Mw or less distributed generation units in the western region They have
