on PM Sent by To Mike cc Subject SF Gate Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilenewsarchivestate EDTDTL Thursday April AP Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech The Associated Press PDT Here is the text of Gov Gray Davis televised speech on energy Thursday as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability if they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Copyright AP,grigsby-m,Manager

on PM Sent by To Mike cc Subject SF Gate Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilenewsarchivestate EDTDTL Thursday April AP Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech The Associated Press PDT Here is the text of Gov Gray Davis televised speech on energy Thursday as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability if they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Copyright AP,grigsby-m,Manager

on PM Sent by To Mike cc Subject SF Gate Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilenewsarchivestate EDTDTL Thursday April AP Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech The Associated Press PDT Here is the text of Gov Gray Davis televised speech on energy Thursday as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability if they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Copyright AP,grigsby-m,Manager

statements I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control Jason Daniel and I worked to get everything straight for September October will not be much different The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron only BP This actually makes life easier As soon as I meet with the back offices groups I will report what I learned Based on my meetings with settlements during Julys process I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle However checking and double checking the processes will not hurt I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings Hopefully next week Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens I will let you know We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances We are clear through June as far as PL is concerned I think Matt Smith was working on July We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O to Jane but we have worked through the problems Thanks for the note on the group I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible especially since bidweek is coming up We have a good method for

situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress RJ The War on the Ground For the most part the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s pecial forces inserted into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th e collected intelligence from various sources to snatch bin Laden and oth ers or to find other targets identify them and then call in attack aircr aft Such attacks are by now wellpriced in and would appear to be unlikel y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets Over the weekend the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu rrently the US has Delta Force Green Beret and Army Ranger units on the g round and some special operation forces incountry Also British Speci al Air Service units the French Regiment de Parachutistes dInfanterie de Marine and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role Adv ance groups of the US st and nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan which is just wes t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar Allied ground troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored A C armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower ranging from nearly US Air Force B and B bombers and Fs and F s as well as the nearly aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise the USS Theodore Roosevelt the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Kitty Hawk In additio n the British have some troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro und the HMS Invincible Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli ance the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak istan the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini mum Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden Fiscal Stimulus Outlook By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m easures totaling somewhere between and billion if you count the billion in airplane and reconstructiondefense spending already passed Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that taxcutting gets preferen ce over spending but that there will have to be some direct spending to an esthetize the centerleft crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate bailouts that have not yet includ ed anything directly for the employees So for now here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec ts Payroll tax cutsuspension This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to As a stimulus item the economics are pro bably better on this than almost anything else since it puts money directl y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly Although it could add up to a very big num ber if suspended bn per year because this is the money that goes in to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this Still both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this Some version is li kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around bn Accelerate the Bush tax cut If the original Bush tax cut was the rig ht medicine then why not have some more The thinking here is that you hav e already agreed to do these things and you no longer are watching the bud get flip from black to red why not put more money in the hands of those wh o pay the most taxes The White House has been putting this idea forward b ut not too aggressively and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than t he rich Chances low but if there is a broad package this could get in Capital gains tax cut This came on fast and has essentially died It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like Take this one off you r list Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp athetic but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way but t he totals being batted around over billion for the retraining and heal th care components alone send the Texas components of House leaders into s hock complaining of socialism Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with airline worker ass istance packages worth about billion Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver but his second and third in command are leading an inhous e rebellion Cut in corporate taxes A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v irtually impossible to wrangle through but a temporary corporate tax cut i s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about bu t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke r assistance package they have to swallow hard for something This was an early favorite of the administrations As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced this one has been runni ng into some tough reality There are a few problems with lower marginal co rporate tax rates that have emerged For one many large corporations pay o n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule thats the Alternative Minimum Tax so they would get no break at all Even more disturbing is th at companies with large taxloss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets since the calcula ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal since their attractiveness to acquirer s depends on their losscarry forwards Finally many employee expenses tha t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules The vas t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t he same problem just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure There is no w ay to propose these without delaying investment On the plus side the acce lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC Also given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward ther e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package but the details dont exist yet and its in the details that the significance of it lies Specific sectoral tax breaks From the steel industry to the restaura nt and hotel industry every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover This is going to be the hardest to handi cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference Cumulatively though these could easily top billion before the special pleading is done Programs like highspeed rail additional defense money additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catchall rubric Some of these will make the cut others will not but they can add up fast Fast Track Trade Authority USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism the Preside nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d eals as necessary But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism I f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response and it doesn t cost anything We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next Again with an endOctober deadline there isnt a lot of time t o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that

fyiAK Original Message From Bryon Sehlke Sent Friday September AM To Aaron Kozmetsky Chad Muir Subject FW some thought a little more on the radical side this was forwarded to me by Walt Cunningham who was an astronaut in the Gemini days hes on the texas aerospace commission with me Original Message From Walter Cunningham mailto Sent Wednesday September PM If we all did this our problem would be solved Walt The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit I send it on to you with the same invitation It offers some pretty good ideas My name is John Burnett I am a DC Captain for FedEx I am also a Police Officer for the Memphis Police Department My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions a pilot might consider when faced with a modernday hijacker These thoughts are outsidethebox when it comes to the way weve all been trained Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement them as a part of our normal training cycles They couldnt for fear of lawsuits I am distributing this via email to buddies Ive flown with Im asking them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry and for you to send it to yours I know most of us have email and I hope this reaches the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard We have all had training in what to do in case of a hijacking try to keep the hijacker calm make him think youre doing what he wants take him where ever he wants to go etc etc etc Save your passengers your crew and your aircraft In an emergency you will revert to that training When our unfortunate peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijackers demands to open the cockpit door their training probably made them open the door When the fanatics made demands their training told them to comply as best they could I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane what they thought as they descended over New York I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead bodies out of the cockpit But I bet they did as they were trained to do As you look back over recent hijackings FedEx and Egypt Air and now the September th hijackings you see a perpetrator who for one reason or another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself Each of these hijackers except for the FedEx incident were successful They took over the airplane and killed everyone onboard If youre following the news programs today you hear a lot about how we could let these hijackers learn to fly You would think if knowing how to fly would guarantee a successful hijacking Auburn Calloway the FedEx hijacker would have been a hijacker success story Calloway had been a Navy pilot a martial arts student a fellow FedEx crew member and he took all the weapons he needed hammers knives and a spear gun He didnt have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open the cockpit door He just went back to his bag took out his hammer came back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls The crew members on that flight didnt worry about Flight Attendants they didnt worry about passengers All three pilots left the cockpit and fought a handtohand lifeordeath battle To survive todays hijacker you cannot worry about your passengers you cannot worry about your Flight Attendants You must develop a mindset that everyone onboard including yourself is already dead Because if the hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane not only you your crew your passengers and your aircraft are lost but thousands on the ground are at risk One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived is the extraordinary actions of the copilot Although he had brain injury the copilot took the DC and immediately executed a halfroll This maneuver took the hijacker off his feet as the Captain and SO were struggling with him During a point in the maneuver the hijacker Captain and SO were thrown back behind the cockpit door When he righted the airplane the FO then left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane It was only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued he returned to the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing Very few of us have had to confront true evil Fewer still have seriously considered taking the life of another human being I believe this is the reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker The crews heroism that day is beyond belief And any action that leads to a safe landing and recovery cannot be argued with But when the Captain left the FO and SO thinking the situation was under control he was mistaken The FO and SO had sustained serious lifethreatening injuries The hijacker had not As the Captain flew the aircraft the hijacker who had surrendered began the fight anew As the airplane landed the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming the two crew members I mention this for your consideration I would suggest that you make a conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you Today we are at war The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is going to kill you and everyone onboard So how do you do that What weapons are available to us as pilots The intercom Command that all men come forward and fight with the hijackers You have many ablebodied men onboard They are sitting in shock not knowing what to do Command that they come forward and help you kill your attackers And they will come The airplane itself Get the hijackers off their feet Go into an immediate dive to float them to the ceiling Then execute a G positive maneuver and hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor galley shelf etc Pull the fire handles shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off If you lose the battle at least the airplane wont be used as a guided missile on a kamikaze mission With luck maybe these guys didnt learn how to do an inflight restart Then leave the cockpit all of you and kill your attackers dont believe it when they surrender dont be nice to them KILL THEM Flare Gun If your airplane has one the Captain might consider making sure its loaded and secured next to his bag I can think of nothing more satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a fanatics gut The crashaxe I would suggest you have your copilot take it from its holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available Makes an excellent skull crusher Your flashlight The FAA use to require a cell A cell MagLight makes an excellent weapon If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor writhing in pain crush their skulls Your stolen hotel bic pen Drive it into an attackers eye ear throat or into the area just under the jaw bone Thats a particular interesting place to drive it because when he opens his mouth to scream you can read Hyatt sticking there Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets Scoop the eyeballs out It will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes as they dangle there on the ocular nerves Your teeth Remember Hannibal Lecter Eat a nose a cheek or a finger And keep eating Attack with all viciousness A piranha is a small fish but its greatly feared A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with It will at least impress his buddies Now heres my wishlist of things the FAA could do to help especially in this time of war Arm the Captain The battle is not going to require any long shots A small revolver would be a good choice It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to disable your aircraft If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb Id shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the hijacker and his package would be sucked out And hey I if I got sucked out with him Id try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh at him all the way to the ground Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat Police are always looking for something free Donut shops use to be a favorite target for robbers until they started giving donuts to the Police Robbers dont rob donut shops anymore I would suggest each Police Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane Fill every vacant seat with armed Police give them a donut and tell them to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit Stop this silly noknife rule Make it public Tell the public theyre welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard Then everyone will bring them So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help youll have a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber tastes fanatics blood There are even a few of them whod want to keep the fanatics ears as souvenirs None of us is immune Take some time and consider your actions if this event should ever happen to you My prayer is none of you ever have to face this kind of decision Best of luck to you and may God Bless,grigsby-m,Manager

capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of

Enron Falls Amid Concern Debt Threatens Dynegy Bid Update By Stacie Babula Houston Nov Bloomberg Enron Corp shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of billion due by suggesting a takeover by Dynegy Inc may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy Shares of Enron fell or percent to in late morning trading Enrons percent notes due in July were bid at cents on of face value and offered at cents down more than percent from yesterday traders said Enron whose shares plunged percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements a federal investigation and a management shakeup said it has less than billion in cash or credit lines Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade who rates Enron shares hold and doesnt own them They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through and that now looks difficult Dynegy agreed Nov to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at billion in stock and assumed debt The difference between Dynegys offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than percent from percent yesterday Bloomberg data show Its become more clear that the chances of this deal going through arent percent but much closer to fiftyfifty said Edward Paik who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund with million Enron shares Theres just so much information that is unknowable about Enrons financial position he said SEC Filing Last week Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has billion invested in noncore businesses including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt Enron expects to get billions from the sales Whalley said without being more specific Enron wouldnt comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts Asset sales valued at about million are expected close by the end of this year the company said yesterday in its thirdquarter filing with the Securities Exchange Commission Most of the billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close according to the SEC filing Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp which owns percent of Dynegy may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders said Kathleen Vuchetich who helps manage the billion Strong American Utilities Fund which is percent Dynegy shares I never dreamt the billion in debt due would be that large coming due all at once Vuchetich said It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place Enron yesterday reduced thirdquarter results by cents a share bringing the periods loss to cents or million according to the SEC filing On Nov Enron lowered earnings back to by million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books That included a thirdquarter reduction of million A drop in Enrons senior unsecured debt rating to BBB by Standard Poors on Nov may force Enron to pay off a million note by Nov if it doesnt find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership the company said in the filing Without repayment or collateral investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian naturalgas assets can begin to liquidate the partnerships assets Enron said The company said its working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders billion in lost equity Fourth Quarter Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enrons fourthquarter earnings Enron said Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock Because Enrons stock has plunged it may have to write down its assets by million the filing said ChevronTexaco the secondlargest US oil company is providing billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout It provided the first billion a week ago Shares of ChevronTexaco based in San Francisco rose to in midmorning trading Dynegy fell cents to Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston Enrons Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy Before the buyout was announced Enron stock had fallen percent this year,grigsby-m,Manager

to Jane but we have worked through the problems Thanks for the note on the group I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible especially since bidweek is coming up We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly so it should go more smoothly It will still be slow Also Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically I will let you know the time line soon I have a question What does the Wood report mean See you Anne Original Message From Grigsby Mike Sent Tuesday September PM To Bike Anne Subject RE Palo Alto historical loads Disregard attachments How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal i will never understand is it just me Also i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies By the way you are doing a great job It seems like your group is getting their books run early Also have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about PL andor positions Just a reminder You may want to talk to them about confidentiality You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy Right

loads I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end and to clarify the payments that are made I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control Jason Daniel and I worked to get everything straight for September October will not be much different The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron only BP This actually makes life easier As soon as I meet with the back offices groups I will report what I learned Based on my meetings with settlements during Julys process I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle However checking and double checking the processes will not hurt I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings Hopefully next week Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens I will let you know We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances We are clear through June as far as PL is concerned I think Matt Smith was working on July We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O to Jane but we have worked through the problems Thanks for the note on the group I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible especially since bidweek is coming up We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly so it should go more smoothly It will still be

ground campaign strategy timing as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYCwe are investigating and will update as soon as possible Call with questions RJ x Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate With a target list thinner than for Kosovo results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up the next phase of search and destroy ground raids carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces could be imminent Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun All our indications are that the US will commit a light division up to troops and the UK a brigade about This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised More stories along this line may become public over the weekend even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides joining the Taleban against the foreign invader But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives which they have been so far the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited When the ground assault starts from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air Such action will be fast and high risk without much media coverage with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen If the Taleban can be thus loosened special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi Depending on how long this takes there is hope among allied planners that reasonable elements in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broadbased coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom The tally of small isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaedas coffers are now being advised to do so on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Ladens future displeasure Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullahs decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see Blair was particularly galled by Abdullahs blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement Pakistan Holding Steady For Now Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage Even in Peshawar we are told that playing to the cameras has become a distinct element of the protest Musharraf meanwhile having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation just Key Issue for US and Arab allies Wider War There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan the Gulf including Saudi Arabia Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable But if it were to spill over there could be difficulties for these

on PM Sent by To Mike cc Subject SF Gate Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilenewsarchivestate EDTDTL Thursday April AP Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech The Associated Press PDT Here is the text of Gov Gray Davis televised speech on energy Thursday as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability if they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Copyright AP,grigsby-m,Manager

ground campaign strategy timing as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYCwe are investigating and will update as soon as possible Call with questions RJ x Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate With a target list thinner than for Kosovo results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up the next phase of search and destroy ground raids carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces could be imminent Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun All our indications are that the US will commit a light division up to troops and the UK a brigade about This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised More stories along this line may become public over the weekend even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides joining the Taleban against the foreign invader But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives which they have been so far the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited When the ground assault starts from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air Such action will be fast and high risk without much media coverage with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen If the Taleban can be thus loosened special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi Depending on how long this takes there is hope among allied planners that reasonable elements in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broadbased coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom The tally of small isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaedas coffers are now being advised to do so on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Ladens future displeasure Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullahs decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see Blair was particularly galled by Abdullahs blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement Pakistan Holding Steady For Now Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage Even in Peshawar we are told that playing to the cameras has become a distinct element of the protest Musharraf meanwhile having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation just Key Issue for US and Arab allies Wider War There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan the Gulf including Saudi Arabia Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable But if it were to spill over there could be difficulties for these

situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress RJ The War on the Ground For the most part the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s pecial forces inserted into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th e collected intelligence from various sources to snatch bin Laden and oth ers or to find other targets identify them and then call in attack aircr aft Such attacks are by now wellpriced in and would appear to be unlikel y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets Over the weekend the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu rrently the US has Delta Force Green Beret and Army Ranger units on the g round and some special operation forces incountry Also British Speci al Air Service units the French Regiment de Parachutistes dInfanterie de Marine and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role Adv ance groups of the US st and nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan which is just wes t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar Allied ground troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored A C armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower ranging from nearly US Air Force B and B bombers and Fs and F s as well as the nearly aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise the USS Theodore Roosevelt the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Kitty Hawk In additio n the British have some troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro und the HMS Invincible Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli ance the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak istan the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini mum Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden Fiscal Stimulus Outlook By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m easures totaling somewhere between and billion if you count the billion in airplane and reconstructiondefense spending already passed Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that taxcutting gets preferen ce over spending but that there will have to be some direct spending to an esthetize the centerleft crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate bailouts that have not yet includ ed anything directly for the employees So for now here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec ts Payroll tax cutsuspension This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to As a stimulus item the economics are pro bably better on this than almost anything else since it puts money directl y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly Although it could add up to a very big num ber if suspended bn per year because this is the money that goes in to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this Still both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this Some version is li kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around bn Accelerate the Bush tax cut If the original Bush tax cut was the rig ht medicine then why not have some more The thinking here is that you hav e already agreed to do these things and you no longer are watching the bud get flip from black to red why not put more money in the hands of those wh o pay the most taxes The White House has been putting this idea forward b ut not too aggressively and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than t he rich Chances low but if there is a broad package this could get in Capital gains tax cut This came on fast and has essentially died It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like Take this one off you r list Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp athetic but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way but t he totals being batted around over billion for the retraining and heal th care components alone send the Texas components of House leaders into s hock complaining of socialism Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with airline worker ass istance packages worth about billion Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver but his second and third in command are leading an inhous e rebellion Cut in corporate taxes A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v irtually impossible to wrangle through but a temporary corporate tax cut i s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about bu t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke r assistance package they have to swallow hard for something This was an early favorite of the administrations As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced this one has been runni ng into some tough reality There are a few problems with lower marginal co rporate tax rates that have emerged For one many large corporations pay o n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule thats the Alternative Minimum Tax so they would get no break at all Even more disturbing is th at companies with large taxloss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets since the calcula ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal since their attractiveness to acquirer s depends on their losscarry forwards Finally many employee expenses tha t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules The vas t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t he same problem just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure There is no w ay to propose these without delaying investment On the plus side the acce lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC Also given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward ther e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package but the details dont exist yet and its in the details that the significance of it lies Specific sectoral tax breaks From the steel industry to the restaura nt and hotel industry every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover This is going to be the hardest to handi cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference Cumulatively though these could easily top billion before the special pleading is done Programs like highspeed rail additional defense money additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catchall rubric Some of these will make the cut others will not but they can add up fast Fast Track Trade Authority USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism the Preside nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d eals as necessary But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism I f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response and it doesn t cost anything We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next Again with an endOctober deadline there isnt a lot of time t o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that

here cgibinarticlecgifilenewsarchivestateEDTDTL Thursday April AP Text of Gov Gray Davis energy speech The Associated Press PDT Here is the text of Gov Gray Davis televised speech on energy Thursday as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability if they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Copyright AP,grigsby-m,Manager

situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress RJ The War on the Ground For the most part the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s pecial forces inserted into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th e collected intelligence from various sources to snatch bin Laden and oth ers or to find other targets identify them and then call in attack aircr aft Such attacks are by now wellpriced in and would appear to be unlikel y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets Over the weekend the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu rrently the US has Delta Force Green Beret and Army Ranger units on the g round and some special operation forces incountry Also British Speci al Air Service units the French Regiment de Parachutistes dInfanterie de Marine and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role Adv ance groups of the US st and nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan which is just wes t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar Allied ground troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored A C armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower ranging from nearly US Air Force B and B bombers and Fs and F s as well as the nearly aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise the USS Theodore Roosevelt the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Kitty Hawk In additio n the British have some troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro und the HMS Invincible Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli ance the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak istan the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini mum Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden Fiscal Stimulus Outlook By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m easures totaling somewhere between and billion if you count the billion in airplane and reconstructiondefense spending already passed Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that taxcutting gets preferen ce over spending but that there will have to be some direct spending to an esthetize the centerleft crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate bailouts that have not yet includ ed anything directly for the employees So for now here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec ts Payroll tax cutsuspension This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to As a stimulus item the economics are pro bably better on this than almost anything else since it puts money directl y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly Although it could add up to a very big num ber if suspended bn per year because this is the money that goes in to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this Still both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this Some version is li kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around bn Accelerate the Bush tax cut If the original Bush tax cut was the rig ht medicine then why not have some more The thinking here is that you hav e already agreed to do these things and you no longer are watching the bud get flip from black to red why not put more money in the hands of those wh o pay the most taxes The White House has been putting this idea forward b ut not too aggressively and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than t he rich Chances low but if there is a broad package this could get in Capital gains tax cut This came on fast and has essentially died It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like Take this one off you r list Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp athetic but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way but t he totals being batted around over billion for the retraining and heal th care components alone send the Texas components of House leaders into s hock complaining of socialism Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with airline worker ass istance packages worth about billion Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver but his second and third in command are leading an inhous e rebellion Cut in corporate taxes A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v irtually impossible to wrangle through but a temporary corporate tax cut i s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about bu t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke r assistance package they have to swallow hard for something This was an early favorite of the administrations As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced this one has been runni ng into some tough reality There are a few problems with lower marginal co rporate tax rates that have emerged For one many large corporations pay o n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule thats the Alternative Minimum Tax so they would get no break at all Even more disturbing is th at companies with large taxloss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets since the calcula ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal since their attractiveness to acquirer s depends on their losscarry forwards Finally many employee expenses tha t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules The vas t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t he same problem just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure There is no w ay to propose these without delaying investment On the plus side the acce lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC Also given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward ther e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package but the details dont exist yet and its in the details that the significance of it lies Specific sectoral tax breaks From the steel industry to the restaura nt and hotel industry every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover This is going to be the hardest to handi cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference Cumulatively though these could easily top billion before the special pleading is done Programs like highspeed rail additional defense money additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catchall rubric Some of these will make the cut others will not but they can add up fast Fast Track Trade Authority USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism the Preside nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d eals as necessary But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism I f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response and it doesn t cost anything We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next Again with an endOctober deadline there isnt a lot of time t o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact,grigsby-m,Manager

situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress RJ The War on the Ground For the most part the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s pecial forces inserted into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th e collected intelligence from various sources to snatch bin Laden and oth ers or to find other targets identify them and then call in attack aircr aft Such attacks are by now wellpriced in and would appear to be unlikel y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets Over the weekend the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu rrently the US has Delta Force Green Beret and Army Ranger units on the g round and some special operation forces incountry Also British Speci al Air Service units the French Regiment de Parachutistes dInfanterie de Marine and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role Adv ance groups of the US st and nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan which is just wes t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar Allied ground troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored A C armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower ranging from nearly US Air Force B and B bombers and Fs and F s as well as the nearly aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise the USS Theodore Roosevelt the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Kitty Hawk In additio n the British have some troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro und the HMS Invincible Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli ance the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak istan the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini mum Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden Fiscal Stimulus Outlook By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m easures totaling somewhere between and billion if you count the billion in airplane and reconstructiondefense spending already passed Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that taxcutting gets preferen ce over spending but that there will have to be some direct spending to an esthetize the centerleft crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate bailouts that have not yet includ ed anything directly for the employees So for now here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec ts Payroll tax cutsuspension This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to As a stimulus item the economics are pro bably better on this than almost anything else since it puts money directl y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly Although it could add up to a very big num ber if suspended bn per year because this is the money that goes in to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this Still both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this Some version is li kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around bn Accelerate the Bush tax cut If the original Bush tax cut was the rig ht medicine then why not have some more The thinking here is that you hav e already agreed to do these things and you no longer are watching the bud get flip from black to red why not put more money in the hands of those wh o pay the most taxes The White House has been putting this idea forward b ut not too aggressively and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than t he rich Chances low but if there is a broad package this could get in Capital gains tax cut This came on fast and has essentially died It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like Take this one off you r list Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp athetic but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way but t he totals being batted around over billion for the retraining and heal th care components alone send the Texas components of House leaders into s hock complaining of socialism Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with airline worker ass istance packages worth about billion Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver but his second and third in command are leading an inhous e rebellion Cut in corporate taxes A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v irtually impossible to wrangle through but a temporary corporate tax cut i s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about bu t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke r assistance package they have to swallow hard for something This was an early favorite of the administrations As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced this one has been runni ng into some tough reality There are a few problems with lower marginal co rporate tax rates that have emerged For one many large corporations pay o n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule thats the Alternative Minimum Tax so they would get no break at all Even more disturbing is th at companies with large taxloss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets since the calcula ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal since their attractiveness to acquirer s depends on their losscarry forwards Finally many employee expenses tha t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules The vas t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t he same problem just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure There is no w ay to propose these without delaying investment On the plus side the acce lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC Also given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward ther e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package but the details dont exist yet and its in the details that the significance of it lies Specific sectoral tax breaks From the steel industry to the restaura nt and hotel industry every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover This is going to be the hardest to handi cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference Cumulatively though these could easily top billion before the special pleading is done Programs like highspeed rail additional defense money additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catchall rubric Some of these will make the cut others will not but they can add up fast Fast Track Trade Authority USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism the Preside nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d eals as necessary But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism I f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response and it doesn t cost anything We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next Again with an endOctober deadline there isnt a lot of time t o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact,grigsby-m,Manager

ground campaign strategy timing as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYCwe are investigating and will update as soon as possible Call with questions RJ x Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate With a target list thinner than for Kosovo results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up the next phase of search and destroy ground raids carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces could be imminent Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun All our indications are that the US will commit a light division up to troops and the UK a brigade about This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised More stories along this line may become public over the weekend even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides joining the Taleban against the foreign invader But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives which they have been so far the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited When the ground assault starts from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air Such action will be fast and high risk without much media coverage with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen If the Taleban can be thus loosened special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi Depending on how long this takes there is hope among allied planners that reasonable elements in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broadbased coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom The tally of small isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaedas coffers are now being advised to do so on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Ladens future displeasure Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullahs decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see Blair was particularly galled by Abdullahs blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement Pakistan Holding Steady For Now Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage Even in Peshawar we are told that playing to the cameras has become a distinct element of the protest Musharraf meanwhile having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation just Key Issue for US and Arab allies Wider War There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan the Gulf including Saudi Arabia Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable But if it were to spill over there could be difficulties for these

had a fine holiday weekend Mine was great Several committee members have expressed an interest in learning more about the events that lead to and resulted from the unexpected working gas storage number reported a few weeks ago in the AGA American Gas Storage Survey At the committees request the following is a brief message from Chris McGill managing director of policy analysis regarding this activity Please review the material below and attached By the end of this week or early next week I will forward to you the summary referenced in the final paragraph below for your comments andor concerns Thank you Have an awesome day Original Message From McGill Chris Sent Tuesday September AM To Denbow Kimberly Cc Wilkinson Paul Shin David Pierson Paul Subject To AGA Underground Storage Committee Members Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update on the recent activities of AGAs American Gas Storage Survey AGSS Certainly the voluntary survey and resulting estimates of working gas in storage for the nation would not be possible without your help and support There are three issues I would like to cover in this message including the recent revision of working gas an issue of continuing the reporting and current procedures and methods Regarding the recent report and subsequent revision of working gas in storage for the Consuming Region East please know that we continue to follow our procedures for data collection verification and distribution Several weeks ago we flagged several survey submittals that seemed different from traditional patterns in the eastern region for this time of year Followup to the submittals was set in motion however were not fully resolved until days after the Wednesday posting period It is our policy to consider eliminating certain data submittals if questions arise about the validity of the data In this case inclusion of the data or elimination of the data from the computational spreadsheets did not change the fact that a very low net build would be reported for the nation Because of that we opted to go forward with our estimates and continue to pursue our verification efforts Simply put we dont make up numbers for companies when we have an actual report in hand just to create a final estimate of working gas changes that fits more closely with market expectations What turned out to be a clerical error in the data reported to us was discovered and a revised survey submitted Our revision of the estimates of working gas in storage for the eastern region and the total US came one week later at our normal reporting period as is our stated policy for distributing revisions to the public The fact is that we have revised our data about times in the past years or about weekly reports Our accuracy can be clearly documented by comparing the AGSS estimates to that of EIA The attached slides do just that as well as show the current level of working gas compared to the prior fiveyear average What seems to have developed in the natural gas market particularly among traders is a lack of tolerance between what we report and what the market expects In order to continue our reach for consistency we are reviewing our methods and procedures to ensure that they continue to reflect the best practices of completing a report such as the weekly estimates of working gas Our evolving methods and procedures issue brief is attached Any comments you have on the stated procedures or regarding this memorandum in general can be directed to me Finally the issue of whether we continue to report the estimates of working gas publicly remains one to be considered by the AGA Board of Directors Like all projects at AGA the AGSS come under periodic scrutiny for its value to the members and to the gas market in general However like many realtime information sources the sequential data set has become sensitive over time Please be alerted to the fact that a summary is being prepared by AGA for presentation to board members on this issue It is our intention to copy the Underground Storage Committee on the documentation that is distributed It seems likely that if AGA discontinues the weekly reporting of working gas that some other entity federal or otherwise will pick it up Again if you have comments on this memorandum the attachments to this memo or the AGSS summary to be presented to the AGA Board not attached but expected to be copied to you soon please make them to me or to the appropriate person at your company I appreciate your attention to this matter Your support of the American Gas Storage Survey is

Hector Rd mmcfd Both will be available around Feb Basis of ProRationCurrent Windows Calculation Currently Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system Gas Select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations New Calculation Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast They use Weather Bank as one of their tools OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well Lots of complaints People were complaining that it restricted access to the system Eliminating point specific calculation Open system to Max Oper Limits or Contractual Limits Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug procedures No changes to Wheeler Ridge Due to the need to maintain operational control an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle Replace windows with operational maximum volumes If CPUC approves comprehensive settlement will post days of information to anticipate OFOs Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows Scheduling ChangesNov Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid No direct dialup Rollover nomsnoms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms

leaving message on Socal Hotline and list of email messages that can go directly to pagers Gas Select is official notification Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail Gas Select is a subscriber based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free OFOs are going to be system wide and not customer specific OFOs can be declared intraday Once OFO declared it will be kept for entire day Concerned that if call off will have to put back on Dont want to go back and forth This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works Many times Socal see an increase of mmcfday

expected usage No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO Use Elapsed ProRata Rules Expected Usagecut nominations to of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy Generators need to revise expected usage Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal Flow Day Diversions dont go into effect until after Cycle Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed If call OFO after cycle or and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised If OFO called Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows Cycle Nom cut Cycle Nom cut Cylce Nom cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle if OFO callled after cycle and no improvement is realized Will allocate prorata Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point In other words if OFO declared during Cycle and no relief after cycles Socal will window Cycle and prorata cut Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles For penalty purposes actual burn from oclock to
