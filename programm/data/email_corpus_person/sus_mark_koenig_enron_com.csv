ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY POLICY ISSUES AT HOUSTON LUNCHEON PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES October SUBJECT Electric Utilities ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale CurrentAccumulate David R Tameron Risk HIGHLIGHTS On October FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on Competition Americas Energy Policy to group of Houston industry executives addressing the merits and problems with electricity deregulation Commissioner Hebert the sole Republican supports a comprehensive energy policy renewable fuel use improved pipeline certification and flexibility but opposes price controls and free market intervention Last week the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a market stabilization plan that would affectively cap the price electricity at mWh unless of the power generated is sold forward within the state FERC is expected to address this issue on but we do not expect much involvement until after the presidential elections particularly given that the FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees While we believe FERCs role in the electricity market problems in California will be limited any action taken is likely to be bold ambitious and strict requiring results but likely would not affect DISCUSSION Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and congressional races and spiking energy prices have been an area of contention Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity and this past summer hot weather in the western US sent electricity prices soaring In California where the rate payers served by PGE and Edison International are protected under a rate freeze the higher power costs cannot be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer In southern California the situation is just the opposite Having recovered its stranded investment costs from its ratepayers Semipro Energy is charging market rates to consumers which are complaining of higher electric bills While the government has intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state and has capped the electric bills of lowincome consumers in San Diego the state regulators are calling for more government involvement In California several proposals are on the table A consumer group has called for the excessive profits earned by generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to ratepayers US Rep Bob Finer DCalifornia introduced a bill to the House that would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits imposing a windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western US As recently as last night October the California Independent System Operator ISO implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps on generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between negative MWh and positive MWh Effective on the proposal essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able to economically produce power within the state California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a bid cap on electricity of mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply with the requirement of selling of their load under forward contracts within the state of California Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means that spot power will be sold under the existing mWh price cap but violators would be subjected to the bid cap California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their contracts preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts thus ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power shortage While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current form the government is likely to be involved The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy markets and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to competition thus far except for in the Midwest As a reminder the FERC is made up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President and currently the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican the other Republican commissioner resigned earlier this year On Thursday October the sole Republican Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the subject of Competition and Americas Energy Policy While his opinions are not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole Hebert clearly supports regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental issues He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity price caps in New England New York and California Hebert believes that the recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market indicators that electric generation is in short supply particularly during periods of hot weather In the summer of the Midwest experienced similar price spikes also related to summer heat The difference between the two situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide which responded with new generation projects but California imposed price controls on electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation Thus the short supply situation in California may just get worse The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general public While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation in that state any actions would not likely take affect until In the interim the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to provide emergency financial relief Proposals include a refundable rate surplus removal of frozen rates andor the deferral of stranded cost recovery We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections because political considerations may influence their decisions Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to send to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work and believe that any plan should be bold ambitious and strict in requiring results Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged although this is not necessarily good news for the natural gas industry and old issues like the Fuel Use Act and the Btu tax may resurface Ideally the FERC would endorse market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure However by doing so the FERC may be perceived as the bad guy which may not be ideal image in an election year However Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right regulatory decision for the long term The benefits of price controls are short term and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of the US opens to electric competition Prudential Securities Incorporated or one of its

ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale Current Strong Buy David R Tameron Risk Moderate HIGHLIGHTS Key players in California energy crisis meeting continuing to meet in Washington nothing material has yet to be finalized Our expectations are detailed within Cautioning investors to avoid stocks with California exposure until a more longer term solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive Duke Energy conference call reiterated that about of California portfolio is hedged forward with nonutilities or in transactions outside of the Independent System Operator ISO or Power Exchange PX We estimate Dukes financial exposure is less than per share annually DISCUSSIONThoughts on California and brief comments on the Duke Energy Conference Call Key representatives of the California utilities power generators marketers have been in meetings in Washington DC with the FERC Chairman Secretary of Energy US Treasurer and members of the Clinton staff We have the following comments on what we believe may be and should be longterm solutions to the California energy crisis What we think will come out of Washington meetings Power generators will agree to selling power under longterm up to year contracts at the capped retail rates Megawatt hour MWh assuming that they can buy gas supply forward However that market is very illiquid and can take weeks to secure a transaction Politicianslegislators want to avoid bankruptcies but we still think there is a probability Utilities likely to be able to buysell electricity in forward market California is likely to eliminate the Power Exchange PX and replace with negotiated buysell market Forbearance brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the bills The impact on the receivables of the power generatorsmarketers and lenders is uncertain We believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers by the state is unlikely as is the removal of emissions credits also we understand NOx emissions credits can be as high as Megawatt hour in California Resignation of reigning FERC Commissioner Jim Hoecker on allows for Bushappointed commissioner to step in most likely to be Republican Curt Hebert Herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports competitive markets Under a new FERC we think there is a low risk of retroactive repercussions on generators to give back past profits on electricity sold in California last summer and also that a windfall profits tax on generatorsmarketers is unlikely Companies such as DUK DYN and ENE all appear to have less than per share of annual earnings exposure to California generationmarketing sales net of risk mitigation However recent conversations with Reliant Energy have revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in California Typical monthly receivable balances range from million or up to of earnings exposure REI is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of PGE and Edison is unlikely and therefore the cost to set of credit reserves at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure While these stocks in addition to REI appear oversold the stock performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the CA energy crisis is introduced In our view the California market solutions fall short of the big picture I have been cautioning investors to avoid the abovementioned stocks until a more longerterm solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so Still DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive in our view We expect DYN DUK ENE and REI to all report positive Q earnings surprises of at least a penny or so but to the extent that the surprise is related to power generation the stocks may not react favorably What we think will solve the California problem Eliminate all retail rate freezes and let the market forces balance supply and demand Higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment and will also encourage independent generators to build new facilities We agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for unregulated electricity transactions A word on the hydroelectric generators Most are governmentowned facilities that virtually generate electricity for free It would stand to reason that the hydroelectric generators aka the federal government has been financial benefiting from selling free power into a market that has been marginally priced off of highpriced natural gas Shouldnt the government also be asked to share the pain Following highlights from DUK call Duke controls or owns megawatts of electric generating capacity out of a portfolio of about megawatts About of its California portfolio is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions involving the Independent System Operator or Power Exchange Dukes receivables at risk are not material financially or operationally according to the company Duke pointed out that just over of EBIT is generated from its wholesale energy business although we estimate it is closer to Duke has a minimal number of contracts with PGE and SoCal Ed EIX subsidiary Nothing material has been agreed upon in the Washington meetings between industry representatives legislators and feds but the likelihood of power plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely We estimate DUKs annual financial exposure net of forward sales is less than per share annually Stocks mentioned in this

SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CR Part of SALOMON SMITH BARNEY Industry Note Power Natural Gas SQUEEZING BLOOD FROM A STONE SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CRISIS January SUMMARY California utilities PCG EIX threaten bankruptcy in Raymond Niles face of cash squeeze and decision by California Public Utilities Commission to grant a rate increase versus the hoped for by the utilities Two key points Based on the companies statements we think there is material risk that the California utilities will declare bankruptcy although this still remains the least likely outcome in our view We maintain our H Neutral High Risk rating on PCG at the present time We recommend investors hold the course on Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators Favorable longterm fundamentals remain in place Ultimately we think a marketoriented solution will favor these companies but anticipate nearterm uncertainty as the California situation plays itself out Companies with most to least California exposure are CPN SOE DYN NRG DUK REI AES ENE TWO MESSAGES TO INVESTORS Worry about the California electric utilities PCG and EIX Material bankruptcy risk exists for these companies Although we do not think it is the most likely outcome we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by the small rate increase proposed by the California Public Utilities Commission Even if bankruptcy does not occur we think that the California utilities will continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow concerns if adequate rate increases are not enacted Hold the course on the Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators The longterm fundamentals for these companies remains firm in our view For the generators we forecast higher power prices nationwide in vs At the same time we see the spark spread or the spread between power revenues and gas costs widening by several percentage points during the same time period Both of these factors are positive for earnings For the marketers the opportunity to hedge and manage energy price risk has only been heightened by the turmoil in California We also remain bullish on these companies Exposures of Generators to California Power Markets Megawatts Company RatingPx Total California of Total AES H CPN H DYN H NRG H SOE H ENE H DUK M REI M DUK and REI also have extensive regulated utility operations so there corporate financial exposure to California is far less than the percentages indicated WHAT LIES AHEAD POINTS TO CONSIDER Someone must pay for the cost of power in California Currently natural gas prices are around per mcf or million BTUs which equates to electricity prices north of per megawatthour This reflects the cost of burning gas to create electricity and does not consider other costs such as pollution emissions operating and maintenance costs and the capital costs of plant investment The longterm problem in California and elsewhere in the country will not be solved without the construction of new power plants All the bellyaching in the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem which is California does not have enough power plants The wholesale price of electricity reflects supply and demand There are not enough electrons in the states power grid More electrons will come either from new plants power generation or marketing shipping more electricity into the state We also think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced such as natural gas pipeline and electric transmission capacity The generators and marketers are solving the problem Companies such as Dynegy Enron El Paso Energy Duke Energy Calpine Southern Energy AES NRG Energy and others are either building the plants andor marketing the power and natural gas that will in the long run solve Californias power crisis In fact the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the incentives and the reward for them to do so In our view if sufficient new generating capacity is built in California the wholesale price of power will fall We think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction of new plants by power prices could be materially lower than they are today Reregulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in California Capping wholesale power prices imposing windfall profits taxes or other punitive measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built or a single new electron to be sold in the state Such measures would dis incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis We already think that the threat of reregulation has had the perverse effect of raising wholesale power prices by disincentivizing sales into the state OUR INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS First the longterm outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable They are supplying a commodity in short supply As long as the supplydemand balance and price volatility remain we expect strong earnings visibility from this core group of companies We especially recommend accumulating positions in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season Second attempts to reregulate or punish energy wholesalers could create nearterm volatility in the stocks we recommend buying on such weakness Given our longterm view we do not think that attempts to reregulate will be successful In fact by doing so policymakers would merely lengthen and deepen the crisis that already exists Also recognition that the wholesale market is working well in other regions such as Texas would only stimulate a debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any controls in our view Price LTG Company SYM Rating Target Price EST PE EST PEG M Energy Merchants Enron Corp ENE H Duke Energy DUK M El Paso Energy EPG H Dynegy Inc DYN H Power Producers Southern Energy SOE H Calpine Corp CPN H AES Corp AES H NRG Energy NR H Within the past three years Salomon Smith Barney including its parent subsidiaries andor affiliates has acted as manager or comanager of a public offering of this company WHATS AHEAD NEARTERM EVENTS Nearterm we await several events Each of these has the potential for creating trading opportunities in the stocks Decision by SP and Moodys on whether to downgrade the debt of PCG and EIX They have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to junk status ie below investment grade if the CPUC does not grant a sufficient rate increase We think that the rate increase proposed by the CPUC is probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies and that a debt downgrade is likely We think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the stocks but the action still could create volatility An emergency legislative hearing is underway This hearing is deciding among other measures whether to impose a windfall profits tax or other punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers Given what we said above we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers but only on a nearterm basis We would recommend buying on such weakness An action that would be positive in our view would be any move by the legislature to address the root cause of Californias problem the restrictive policies that make it difficult to build plants in the state eg pollution rules siting permits etc Decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy The utilities suffer from a negative cash flow and have incurred over billion in incremental costs to pay for power Their cash gross margin is negative because they receive a low regulated price for retail power and pay a high unregulated price for wholesale power The utilities lenders are watching carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the CPUC is sufficient to address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a shortterm basis If the utilities cannot get shortterm funding we think insolvency is a likely eventuality in our view We still think bankruptcy is the least likely outcome and for that reason a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy suppliers Final decision by the CPUC on their proposed rate increase A final decision on the proposed increase will be made today If the CPUC decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase this would be positive for the utilities and marketers Credit risk to suppliers worst case analysis The generators and marketers who sell power to the California utilities have significant credit risks associated with those exposures The figure below attempts to quantify those risks which could result in a onetime earnings hit The figures we have calculated are a worstcase analysis in our view and any actual exposure are likely to be much less First these risks will only become a reality in the case of the utilities bankruptcy Second even given this worstcase bankruptcy scenario the generators and marketers will likely be treated favorably in the bankruptcy case given their status as trade creditors day receivables Third based on our conversations with these companies they have already taken steps to mitigate these exposures by tightening credit limits requiring payments in cash etc MWHs Produced

consumers which are complaining of higher electric bills While the government has intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state and has capped the electric bills of lowincome consumers in San Diego the state regulators are calling for more government involvement In California several proposals are on the table A consumer group has called for the excessive profits earned by generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to ratepayers US Rep Bob Finer DCalifornia introduced a bill to the House that would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits imposing a windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western US As recently as last night October the California Independent System Operator ISO implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps on generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between negative MWh and positive MWh Effective on the proposal essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able to economically produce power within the state California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a bid cap on electricity of mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply with the requirement of selling of their load under forward contracts within the state of California Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means that spot power will be sold under the existing mWh price cap but violators would be subjected to the bid cap California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their contracts preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts thus ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power shortage While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current form the government is likely to be involved The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy markets and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to competition thus far except for in the Midwest As a reminder the FERC is made up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President and currently the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican the other Republican commissioner resigned earlier this year On Thursday October the sole Republican Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the subject of Competition and Americas Energy Policy While his opinions are not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole Hebert clearly supports regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental issues He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity price caps in New England New York and California Hebert believes that the recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market indicators that electric generation is in short supply particularly during periods of hot weather In the summer of the Midwest experienced similar price spikes also related to summer heat The difference between the two situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide which responded with new generation projects but California imposed price controls on electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation Thus the short supply situation in California may just get worse The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general public While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation in that state any actions would not likely take affect until In the interim the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to provide emergency financial relief Proposals include a refundable rate surplus removal of frozen rates andor the deferral of stranded cost recovery We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections because political considerations may influence their decisions Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to send to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work and believe that any plan should be bold ambitious and strict in requiring results Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged although this is not necessarily good news for the natural gas industry and old issues like the Fuel Use Act and the Btu tax may resurface Ideally the FERC would endorse market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure However by doing so the FERC may be perceived as the bad guy which may not be ideal image in an election year However Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right regulatory decision for the long term The benefits of price controls are short term and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of the US opens to electric competition Prudential Securities Incorporated or one of its

ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale Current Strong Buy David R Tameron Risk Moderate HIGHLIGHTS Key players in California energy crisis meeting continuing to meet in Washington nothing material has yet to be finalized Our expectations are detailed within Cautioning investors to avoid stocks with California exposure until a more longer term solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive Duke Energy conference call reiterated that about of California portfolio is hedged forward with nonutilities or in transactions outside of the Independent System Operator ISO or Power Exchange PX We estimate Dukes financial exposure is less than per share annually DISCUSSIONThoughts on California and brief comments on the Duke Energy Conference Call Key representatives of the California utilities power generators marketers have been in meetings in Washington DC with the FERC Chairman Secretary of Energy US Treasurer and members of the Clinton staff We have the following comments on what we believe may be and should be longterm solutions to the California energy crisis What we think will come out of Washington meetings Power generators will agree to selling power under longterm up to year contracts at the capped retail rates Megawatt hour MWh assuming that they can buy gas supply forward However that market is very illiquid and can take weeks to secure a transaction Politicianslegislators want to avoid bankruptcies but we still think there is a probability Utilities likely to be able to buysell electricity in forward market California is likely to eliminate the Power Exchange PX and replace with negotiated buysell market Forbearance brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the bills The impact on the receivables of the power generatorsmarketers and lenders is uncertain We believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers by the state is unlikely as is the removal of emissions credits also we understand NOx emissions credits can be as high as Megawatt hour in California Resignation of reigning FERC Commissioner Jim Hoecker on allows for Bushappointed commissioner to step in most likely to be Republican Curt Hebert Herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports competitive markets Under a new FERC we think there is a low risk of retroactive repercussions on generators to give back past profits on electricity sold in California last summer and also that a windfall profits tax on generatorsmarketers is unlikely Companies such as DUK DYN and ENE all appear to have less than per share of annual earnings exposure to California generationmarketing sales net of risk mitigation However recent conversations with Reliant Energy have revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in California Typical monthly receivable balances range from million or up to of earnings exposure REI is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of PGE and Edison is unlikely and therefore the cost to set of credit reserves at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure While these stocks in addition to REI appear oversold the stock performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the CA energy crisis is introduced In our view the California market solutions fall short of the big picture I have been cautioning investors to avoid the abovementioned stocks until a more longerterm solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so Still DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive in our view We expect DYN DUK ENE and REI to all report positive Q earnings surprises of at least a penny or so but to the extent that the surprise is related to power generation the stocks may not react favorably What we think will solve the California problem Eliminate all retail rate freezes and let the market forces balance supply and demand Higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment and will also encourage independent generators to build new facilities We agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for unregulated electricity transactions A word on the hydroelectric generators Most are governmentowned facilities that virtually generate electricity for free It would stand to reason that the hydroelectric generators aka the federal government has been financial benefiting from selling free power into a market that has been marginally priced off of highpriced natural gas Shouldnt the government also be asked to share the pain Following highlights from DUK call Duke controls or owns megawatts of electric generating capacity out of a portfolio of about megawatts About of its California portfolio is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions involving the Independent System Operator or Power Exchange Dukes receivables at risk are not material financially or operationally according to the company Duke pointed out that just over of EBIT is generated from its wholesale energy business although we estimate it is closer to Duke has a minimal number of contracts with PGE and SoCal Ed EIX subsidiary Nothing material has been agreed upon in the Washington meetings between industry representatives legislators and feds but the likelihood of power plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely We estimate DUKs annual financial exposure net of forward sales is less than per share annually Stocks mentioned in this

DYN NRG DUK REI AES ENE TWO MESSAGES TO INVESTORS Worry about the California electric utilities PCG and EIX Material bankruptcy risk exists for these companies Although we do not think it is the most likely outcome we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by the small rate increase proposed by the California Public Utilities Commission Even if bankruptcy does not occur we think that the California utilities will continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow concerns if adequate rate increases are not enacted Hold the course on the Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators The longterm fundamentals for these companies remains firm in our view For the generators we forecast higher power prices nationwide in vs At the same time we see the spark spread or the spread between power revenues and gas costs widening by several percentage points during the same time period Both of these factors are positive for earnings For the marketers the

Megawatts Company RatingPx Total California of Total AES H CPN H DYN H NRG H SOE H ENE H DUK M REI M DUK and REI also have extensive regulated utility operations so there corporate financial exposure to California is far less than the percentages indicated WHAT LIES AHEAD POINTS TO CONSIDER Someone must pay for the cost of power in California Currently natural gas prices are around per mcf or million BTUs which equates to electricity prices north of per megawatthour This reflects the cost of burning gas to create electricity and does not consider other costs such as pollution emissions operating and maintenance costs and the capital costs of plant investment The longterm problem in California and elsewhere in the country will not be solved without the construction of new power plants All the bellyaching in the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem which is California does not have enough power plants The wholesale price of electricity reflects supply and demand There are not enough electrons in the states power grid More electrons will come either from new plants power generation or marketing shipping more electricity into the state We also think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced such as natural gas pipeline and electric transmission capacity The generators and marketers are solving the problem Companies such as Dynegy Enron El Paso Energy Duke Energy Calpine Southern Energy AES NRG Energy and others are either building the plants andor marketing the power and natural gas that will in the long run solve Californias power crisis In fact the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the incentives and the reward for them to do so In our view if sufficient new generating capacity is built in California the wholesale price of power will fall We think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction of new plants by power prices could be materially lower than they are today Reregulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in California Capping wholesale power prices imposing windfall profits taxes or other punitive measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built or a single new electron to be sold in the state Such measures would dis incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis We already think that the threat of reregulation has had the perverse effect of raising wholesale power prices by disincentivizing sales into the state OUR INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS First the longterm outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable They are supplying a commodity in short supply As long as the supplydemand balance and price volatility remain we expect strong earnings visibility from this core group of companies We especially recommend accumulating positions in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season Second attempts to reregulate or punish energy wholesalers could create nearterm volatility in the stocks we recommend buying on such weakness Given our longterm view we do not think that attempts to reregulate will be successful In fact by doing so policymakers would merely lengthen and deepen the crisis that already exists Also recognition that the wholesale market is working well in other regions such as Texas would only stimulate a debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any

Moodys on whether to downgrade the debt of PCG and EIX They have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to junk status ie below investment grade if the CPUC does not grant a sufficient rate increase We think that the rate increase proposed by the CPUC is probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies and that a debt downgrade is likely We think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the stocks but the action still could create volatility An emergency legislative hearing is underway This hearing is deciding among other measures whether to impose a windfall profits tax or other punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers Given what we said above we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers but only on a nearterm basis We would recommend buying on such weakness An action that would be positive in our view would be any move by the legislature to address the root cause of Californias problem the restrictive policies that make it difficult to build plants in the state eg pollution rules siting permits etc Decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy The utilities suffer from a negative cash flow and have incurred over billion in incremental costs to pay for power Their cash gross margin is negative because they receive a low regulated price for retail power and pay a high unregulated price for wholesale power The utilities lenders are watching carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the CPUC is sufficient to address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a shortterm basis If the utilities cannot get shortterm funding we think insolvency is a likely eventuality in our view We still think bankruptcy is the least likely outcome and for that reason a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy suppliers Final decision by the CPUC on their proposed rate increase A final decision on the proposed increase will be made today If the CPUC decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase this would be positive for the utilities and marketers Credit risk to suppliers worst case analysis The generators and marketers who sell power to the California utilities have significant credit risks associated with those exposures The figure below attempts to quantify those risks which could result in a onetime

Houston industry executives addressing the merits and problems with electricity deregulation Commissioner Hebert the sole Republican supports a comprehensive energy policy renewable fuel use improved pipeline certification and flexibility but opposes price controls and free market intervention Last week the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a market stabilization plan that would affectively cap the price electricity at mWh unless of the power generated is sold forward within the state FERC is expected to address this issue on but we do not expect much involvement until after the presidential elections particularly given that the FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees While we believe FERCs role in the electricity market problems in California will be limited any action taken is likely to be bold ambitious and strict requiring results but likely would not affect DISCUSSION Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and

SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CR Part of SALOMON SMITH BARNEY Industry Note Power Natural Gas SQUEEZING BLOOD FROM A STONE SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CRISIS January SUMMARY California utilities PCG EIX threaten bankruptcy in Raymond Niles face of cash squeeze and decision by California Public Utilities Commission to grant a rate increase versus the hoped for by the utilities Two key points Based on the companies statements we think there is material risk that the California utilities will declare bankruptcy although this still remains the least likely outcome in our view We maintain our H Neutral High Risk rating on PCG at the present time We recommend investors hold the course on Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators Favorable longterm fundamentals remain in place Ultimately we think a marketoriented solution will favor these companies but anticipate nearterm uncertainty as the California situation plays itself out Companies with most to least California exposure are CPN SOE DYN NRG DUK REI AES ENE TWO MESSAGES TO INVESTORS Worry about the California electric utilities PCG and EIX Material bankruptcy risk exists for these companies Although we do not think it is the most likely outcome we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by the small rate increase proposed by the California Public Utilities Commission Even if bankruptcy does not occur we think that the California utilities will continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow concerns if adequate rate increases are not enacted Hold the course on the Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators The longterm fundamentals for these companies remains firm in our view For the generators we forecast higher power prices nationwide in vs At the same time we see the spark spread or the spread between power revenues and gas costs widening by several percentage points during the same time period Both of these factors are positive for earnings For the marketers the opportunity to hedge and manage energy price risk has only been heightened by the turmoil in California We also remain bullish on these companies Exposures of Generators to California Power Markets Megawatts Company RatingPx Total California of Total AES H CPN H DYN H NRG H SOE H ENE H DUK M REI M DUK and REI also have extensive regulated utility operations so there corporate financial exposure to California is far less than the percentages indicated WHAT LIES AHEAD POINTS TO CONSIDER Someone must pay for the cost of power in California Currently natural gas prices are around per mcf or million BTUs which equates to electricity prices north of per megawatthour This reflects the cost of burning gas to create electricity and does not consider other costs such as pollution emissions operating and maintenance costs and the capital costs of plant investment The longterm problem in California and elsewhere in the country will not be solved without the construction of new power plants All the bellyaching in the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem which is California does not have enough power plants The wholesale price of electricity reflects supply and demand There are not enough electrons in the states power grid More electrons will come either from new plants power generation or marketing shipping more electricity into the state We also think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced such as natural gas pipeline and electric transmission capacity The generators and marketers are solving the problem Companies such as Dynegy Enron El Paso Energy Duke Energy Calpine Southern Energy AES NRG Energy and others are either building the plants andor marketing the power and natural gas that will in the long run solve Californias power crisis In fact the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the incentives and the reward for them to do so In our view if sufficient new generating capacity is built in California the wholesale price of power will fall We think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction of new plants by power prices could be materially lower than they are today Reregulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in California Capping wholesale power prices imposing windfall profits taxes or other punitive measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built or a single new electron to be sold in the state Such measures would dis incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis We already think that the threat of reregulation has had the perverse effect of raising wholesale power prices by disincentivizing sales into the state OUR INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS First the longterm outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable They are supplying a commodity in short supply As long as the supplydemand balance and price volatility remain we expect strong earnings visibility from this core group of companies We especially recommend accumulating positions in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season Second attempts to reregulate or punish energy wholesalers could create nearterm volatility in the stocks we recommend buying on such weakness Given our longterm view we do not think that attempts to reregulate will be successful In fact by doing so policymakers would merely lengthen and deepen the crisis that already exists Also recognition that the wholesale market is working well in other regions such as Texas would only stimulate a debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any controls in our view Price LTG Company SYM Rating Target Price EST PE EST PEG M Energy Merchants Enron Corp ENE H Duke Energy DUK M El Paso Energy EPG H Dynegy Inc DYN H Power Producers Southern Energy SOE H Calpine Corp CPN H AES Corp AES H NRG Energy NR H Within the past three years Salomon Smith Barney including its parent subsidiaries andor affiliates has acted as manager or comanager of a public offering of this company WHATS AHEAD NEARTERM EVENTS Nearterm we await several events Each of these has the potential for creating trading opportunities in the stocks Decision by SP and Moodys on whether to downgrade the debt of PCG and EIX They have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to junk status ie below investment grade if the CPUC does not grant a sufficient rate increase We think that the rate increase proposed by the CPUC is probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies and that a debt downgrade is likely We think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the stocks but the action still could create volatility An emergency legislative hearing is underway This hearing is deciding among other measures whether to impose a windfall profits tax or other punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers Given what we said above we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers but only on a nearterm basis We would recommend buying on such weakness An action that would be positive in our view would be any move by the legislature to address the root cause of Californias problem the restrictive policies that make it difficult to build plants in the state eg pollution rules siting permits etc Decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy The utilities suffer from a negative cash flow and have incurred over billion in incremental costs to pay for power Their cash gross margin is negative because they receive a low regulated price for retail power and pay a high unregulated price for wholesale power The utilities lenders are watching carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the CPUC is sufficient to address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a shortterm basis If the utilities cannot get shortterm funding we think insolvency is a likely eventuality in our view We still think bankruptcy is the least likely outcome and for that reason a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy suppliers Final decision by the CPUC on their proposed rate increase A final decision on the proposed increase will be made today If the CPUC decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase this would be positive for the utilities and marketers Credit risk to suppliers worst case analysis The generators and marketers who sell power to the California utilities have significant credit risks associated with those exposures The figure below attempts to quantify those risks which could result in a onetime earnings hit The figures we have calculated are a worstcase analysis in our view and any actual exposure are likely to be much less First these risks will only become a reality in the case of the utilities bankruptcy Second even given this worstcase bankruptcy scenario the generators and marketers will likely be treated favorably in the bankruptcy case given their status as trade creditors day

AM on PM To cc Subject FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY FIRST CALL RESEARCH NETWORK am EST Oct Prudential CCOALE DYN DUK ENE CPN REI FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY POLICY ISSUES AT HOUSTON LUNCHEON PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES October SUBJECT Electric Utilities ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale CurrentAccumulate David R Tameron Risk HIGHLIGHTS On October FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on Competition Americas Energy Policy to group of Houston industry executives addressing the merits and problems with electricity deregulation Commissioner Hebert the sole Republican supports a comprehensive energy policy renewable fuel use improved pipeline certification and flexibility but opposes price controls and free market intervention Last week the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a market stabilization plan that would affectively cap the price electricity at mWh unless of the power generated is sold forward within the state FERC is expected to address this issue on but we do not expect much involvement until after the presidential elections particularly given that the FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees While we believe FERCs role in the electricity market problems in California will be limited any action taken is likely to be bold ambitious and strict requiring results but likely would not affect DISCUSSION Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and congressional races and spiking energy prices have been an area of contention Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity and this past summer hot weather in the western US sent electricity prices soaring In California where the rate payers served by PGE and Edison International are protected under a rate freeze the higher power costs cannot be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer In southern California the situation is just the opposite Having recovered its stranded investment costs from its ratepayers Semipro Energy is charging market rates to consumers which are complaining of higher electric bills While the government has intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state and has capped the electric bills of lowincome consumers in San Diego the state regulators are calling for more government involvement In California several proposals are on the table A consumer group has called for the excessive profits earned by generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to ratepayers US Rep Bob Finer DCalifornia introduced a bill to the House that would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits imposing a windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western US As recently as last night October the California Independent System Operator ISO implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps on generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between negative MWh and positive MWh Effective on the proposal essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able to economically produce power within the state California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a bid cap on electricity of mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply with the requirement of selling of their load under forward contracts within the state of California Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means that spot power will be sold under the existing mWh price cap but violators would be subjected to the bid cap California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their contracts preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts thus ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power shortage While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current form the government is likely to be involved The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy markets and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to competition thus far except for in the Midwest As a reminder the FERC is made up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President and currently the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican the other Republican commissioner resigned earlier this year On Thursday October the sole Republican Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the subject of Competition and Americas Energy Policy While his opinions are not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole Hebert clearly supports regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental issues He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity price caps in New England New York and California Hebert believes that the recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market indicators that electric generation is in short supply particularly during periods of hot weather In the summer of the Midwest experienced similar price spikes also related to summer heat The difference between the two situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide which responded with new generation projects but California imposed price controls on electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation Thus the short supply situation in California may just get worse The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general public While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation in that state any actions would not likely take affect until In the interim the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to provide emergency financial relief Proposals include a refundable rate surplus removal of frozen rates andor the deferral of stranded cost recovery We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections because political considerations may influence their decisions Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to send to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work and believe that any plan should be bold ambitious and strict in requiring results Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged although this is not necessarily good news for the natural gas industry and old issues like the Fuel Use Act and the Btu tax may resurface Ideally the FERC would endorse market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure However by doing so the FERC may be perceived as the bad guy which may not be ideal image in an election year However Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right regulatory decision for the long term The benefits of price controls are short term and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of the US opens to electric competition Prudential Securities Incorporated or one of its

SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CR Part of SALOMON SMITH BARNEY Industry Note Power Natural Gas SQUEEZING BLOOD FROM A STONE SEEKING CLARITY IN THE CALIF CRISIS January SUMMARY California utilities PCG EIX threaten bankruptcy in Raymond Niles face of cash squeeze and decision by California Public Utilities Commission to grant a rate increase versus the hoped for by the utilities Two key points Based on the companies statements we think there is material risk that the California utilities will declare bankruptcy although this still remains the least likely outcome in our view We maintain our H Neutral High Risk rating on PCG at the present time We recommend investors hold the course on Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators Favorable longterm fundamentals remain in place Ultimately we think a marketoriented solution will favor these companies but anticipate nearterm uncertainty as the California situation plays itself out Companies with most to least California exposure are CPN SOE DYN NRG DUK REI AES ENE TWO MESSAGES TO INVESTORS Worry about the California electric utilities PCG and EIX Material bankruptcy risk exists for these companies Although we do not think it is the most likely outcome we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by the small rate increase proposed by the California Public Utilities Commission Even if bankruptcy does not occur we think that the California utilities will continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow concerns if adequate rate increases are not enacted Hold the course on the Energy Merchants and Competitive Generators The longterm fundamentals for these companies remains firm in our view For the generators we forecast higher power prices nationwide in vs At the same time we see the spark spread or the spread between power revenues and gas costs widening by several percentage points during the same time period Both of these factors are positive for earnings For the marketers the opportunity to hedge and manage energy price risk has only been heightened by the turmoil in California We also remain bullish on these companies Exposures of Generators to California Power Markets Megawatts Company RatingPx Total California of Total AES H CPN H DYN H NRG H SOE H ENE H DUK M REI M DUK and REI also have extensive regulated utility operations so there corporate financial exposure to California is far less than the percentages indicated WHAT LIES AHEAD POINTS TO CONSIDER Someone must pay for the cost of power in California Currently natural gas prices are around per mcf or million BTUs which equates to electricity prices north of per megawatthour This reflects the cost of burning gas to create electricity and does not consider other costs such as pollution emissions operating and maintenance costs and the capital costs of plant investment The longterm problem in California and elsewhere in the country will not be solved without the construction of new power plants All the bellyaching in the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem which is California does not have enough power plants The wholesale price of electricity reflects supply and demand There are not enough electrons in the states power grid More electrons will come either from new plants power generation or marketing shipping more electricity into the state We also think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced such as natural gas pipeline and electric transmission capacity The generators and marketers are solving the problem Companies such as Dynegy Enron El Paso Energy Duke Energy Calpine Southern Energy AES NRG Energy and others are either building the plants andor marketing the power and natural gas that will in the long run solve Californias power crisis In fact the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the incentives and the reward for them to do so In our view if sufficient new generating capacity is built in California the wholesale price of power will fall We think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction of new plants by power prices could be materially lower than they are today Reregulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in California Capping wholesale power prices imposing windfall profits taxes or other punitive measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built or a single new electron to be sold in the state Such measures would dis incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis We already think that the threat of reregulation has had the perverse effect of raising wholesale power prices by disincentivizing sales into the state OUR INVESTMENT CONCLUSIONS First the longterm outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable They are supplying a commodity in short supply As long as the supplydemand balance and price volatility remain we expect strong earnings visibility from this core group of companies We especially recommend accumulating positions in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season Second attempts to reregulate or punish energy wholesalers could create nearterm volatility in the stocks we recommend buying on such weakness Given our longterm view we do not think that attempts to reregulate will be successful In fact by doing so policymakers would merely lengthen and deepen the crisis that already exists Also recognition that the wholesale market is working well in other regions such as Texas would only stimulate a debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any controls in our view Price LTG Company SYM Rating Target Price EST PE EST PEG M Energy Merchants Enron Corp ENE H Duke Energy DUK M El Paso Energy EPG H Dynegy Inc DYN H Power Producers Southern Energy SOE H Calpine Corp CPN H AES Corp AES H NRG Energy NR H Within the past three years Salomon Smith Barney including its parent subsidiaries andor affiliates has acted as manager or comanager of a public offering of this company WHATS AHEAD NEARTERM EVENTS Nearterm we await several events Each of these has the potential for creating trading opportunities in the stocks Decision by SP and Moodys on whether to downgrade the debt of PCG and EIX They have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to junk status ie below investment grade if the CPUC does not grant a sufficient rate increase We think that the rate increase proposed by the CPUC is probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies and that a debt downgrade is likely We think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the stocks but the action still could create volatility An emergency legislative hearing is underway This hearing is deciding among other measures whether to impose a windfall profits tax or other punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers Given what we said above we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers but only on a nearterm basis We would recommend buying on such weakness An action that would be positive in our view would be any move by the legislature to address the root cause of Californias problem the restrictive policies that make it difficult to build plants in the state eg pollution rules siting permits etc Decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy The utilities suffer from a negative cash flow and have incurred over billion in incremental costs to pay for power Their cash gross margin is negative because they receive a low regulated price for retail power and pay a high unregulated price for wholesale power The utilities lenders are watching carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the CPUC is sufficient to address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a shortterm basis If the utilities cannot get shortterm funding we think insolvency is a likely eventuality in our view We still think bankruptcy is the least likely outcome and for that reason a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy suppliers Final decision by the CPUC on their proposed rate increase A final decision on the proposed increase will be made today If the CPUC decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase this would be positive for the utilities and marketers Credit risk to suppliers worst case analysis The generators and marketers who sell power to the California utilities have significant credit risks associated with those exposures The figure below attempts to quantify those risks which could result in a onetime earnings hit The figures we have calculated are a worstcase analysis in our view and any actual exposure are likely to be much less First these risks will only become a reality in the case of the utilities bankruptcy Second even given this worstcase bankruptcy scenario the generators and marketers will likely be treated favorably in the bankruptcy case given their status as trade creditors day receivables Third based on our conversations with these companies they have already taken steps to mitigate these exposures by tightening credit limits requiring payments in cash etc MWHs Produced

ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale Current Strong Buy David R Tameron Risk Moderate HIGHLIGHTS Key players in California energy crisis meeting continuing to meet in Washington nothing material has yet to be finalized Our expectations are detailed within Cautioning investors to avoid stocks with California exposure until a more longer term solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive Duke Energy conference call reiterated that about of California portfolio is hedged forward with nonutilities or in transactions outside of the Independent System Operator ISO or Power Exchange PX We estimate Dukes financial exposure is less than per share annually DISCUSSIONThoughts on California and brief comments on the Duke Energy Conference Call Key representatives of the California utilities power generators marketers have been in meetings in Washington DC with the FERC Chairman Secretary of Energy US Treasurer and members of the Clinton staff We have the following comments on what we believe may be and should be longterm solutions to the California energy crisis What we think will come out of Washington meetings Power generators will agree to selling power under longterm up to year contracts at the capped retail rates Megawatt hour MWh assuming that they can buy gas supply forward However that market is very illiquid and can take weeks to secure a transaction Politicianslegislators want to avoid bankruptcies but we still think there is a probability Utilities likely to be able to buysell electricity in forward market California is likely to eliminate the Power Exchange PX and replace with negotiated buysell market Forbearance brings up issues of whether the utility can defer payments for power supply for a number of periods or whether the state will pick up the bills The impact on the receivables of the power generatorsmarketers and lenders is uncertain We believe actual seizure of power plants from the unregulated suppliers by the state is unlikely as is the removal of emissions credits also we understand NOx emissions credits can be as high as Megawatt hour in California Resignation of reigning FERC Commissioner Jim Hoecker on allows for Bushappointed commissioner to step in most likely to be Republican Curt Hebert Herbert has been vehemently opposed to price caps and supports competitive markets Under a new FERC we think there is a low risk of retroactive repercussions on generators to give back past profits on electricity sold in California last summer and also that a windfall profits tax on generatorsmarketers is unlikely Companies such as DUK DYN and ENE all appear to have less than per share of annual earnings exposure to California generationmarketing sales net of risk mitigation However recent conversations with Reliant Energy have revealed that it has not hedged its receivables risk with the utilities in California Typical monthly receivable balances range from million or up to of earnings exposure REI is betting on the risk of bankruptcy of PGE and Edison is unlikely and therefore the cost to set of credit reserves at this point would more than outweigh potential earnings exposure While these stocks in addition to REI appear oversold the stock performance is likely to be volatile until a solution to the CA energy crisis is introduced In our view the California market solutions fall short of the big picture I have been cautioning investors to avoid the abovementioned stocks until a more longerterm solution is decided upon However the lowest risk is likely in the cheapest stocks and DUK may be the best bet over the week or so Still DYN in the mids and ENE in the mids are also attractive in our view We expect DYN DUK ENE and REI to all report positive Q earnings surprises of at least a penny or so but to the extent that the surprise is related to power generation the stocks may not react favorably What we think will solve the California problem Eliminate all retail rate freezes and let the market forces balance supply and demand Higher electricity prices to the consumer will encourage less use and the purchase of more efficient energy equipment and will also encourage independent generators to build new facilities We agree with the allowance of forward sales and a free spot market for unregulated electricity transactions A word on the hydroelectric generators Most are governmentowned facilities that virtually generate electricity for free It would stand to reason that the hydroelectric generators aka the federal government has been financial benefiting from selling free power into a market that has been marginally priced off of highpriced natural gas Shouldnt the government also be asked to share the pain Following highlights from DUK call Duke controls or owns megawatts of electric generating capacity out of a portfolio of about megawatts About of its California portfolio is hedged forward with third parties that are not utilities or in transactions involving the Independent System Operator or Power Exchange Dukes receivables at risk are not material financially or operationally according to the company Duke pointed out that just over of EBIT is generated from its wholesale energy business although we estimate it is closer to Duke has a minimal number of contracts with PGE and SoCal Ed EIX subsidiary Nothing material has been agreed upon in the Washington meetings between industry representatives legislators and feds but the likelihood of power plant seizures and retroactive penalties appear unlikely We estimate DUKs annual financial exposure net of forward sales is less than per share annually Stocks mentioned in this

AM on PM To cc Subject FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY FIRST CALL RESEARCH NETWORK am EST Oct Prudential CCOALE DYN DUK ENE CPN REI FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY FERC COMMISSIONER HEBERT ADDRESSES ELECTRICITY PRICE CAPS AND OTHER ENERGY POLICY ISSUES AT HOUSTON LUNCHEON PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES October SUBJECT Electric Utilities ANALYSTS OPINION M Carol Coale CurrentAccumulate David R Tameron Risk HIGHLIGHTS On October FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert spoke on Competition Americas Energy Policy to group of Houston industry executives addressing the merits and problems with electricity deregulation Commissioner Hebert the sole Republican supports a comprehensive energy policy renewable fuel use improved pipeline certification and flexibility but opposes price controls and free market intervention Last week the California ISO called on the FERC to rule on a market stabilization plan that would affectively cap the price electricity at mWh unless of the power generated is sold forward within the state FERC is expected to address this issue on but we do not expect much involvement until after the presidential elections particularly given that the FERC Commissioners are Presidential appointees While we believe FERCs role in the electricity market problems in California will be limited any action taken is likely to be bold ambitious and strict requiring results but likely would not affect DISCUSSION Energy is one of the leading topics in the approaching general elections and congressional races and spiking energy prices have been an area of contention Regional shortages have resulted in spikes in the price of electricity and this past summer hot weather in the western US sent electricity prices soaring In California where the rate payers served by PGE and Edison International are protected under a rate freeze the higher power costs cannot be passed on by the electric utilities to the consumer In southern California the situation is just the opposite Having recovered its stranded investment costs from its ratepayers Semipro Energy is charging market rates to consumers which are complaining of higher electric bills While the government has intervened by approving price caps on ancillary electric service in the state and has capped the electric bills of lowincome consumers in San Diego the state regulators are calling for more government involvement In California several proposals are on the table A consumer group has called for the excessive profits earned by generators and marketers this past summer to be retroactively refunded to ratepayers US Rep Bob Finer DCalifornia introduced a bill to the House that would create disincentives for power companies to earn profits imposing a windfall profits tax on wholesale power sold in the western US As recently as last night October the California Independent System Operator ISO implemented an interim measure that imposes hourly price caps on generators based on forecasted load and arbitrary heat rates ranging between negative MWh and positive MWh Effective on the proposal essentially shuts down the peaking generation plants which would not be able to economically produce power within the state California ISO staff has also proposed to impose a bid cap on electricity of mWh on power generators and marketers in the state that do not comply with the requirement of selling of their load under forward contracts within the state of California Compliance with this Market Stabilization Plan means that spot power will be sold under the existing mWh price cap but violators would be subjected to the bid cap California plans to require interruptible users of power to extend their contracts preventing these end users from switching to firm contracts thus ensuring that certain customers can be shut off in the event of a power shortage While we doubt that any of these proposals will be passed in their current form the government is likely to be involved The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC has been overseeing the deregulation of the wholesale energy markets and has approved price caps in all of the regions that have opened to competition thus far except for in the Midwest As a reminder the FERC is made up of commissioners that are appointed by the reigning President and currently the FERC is made up of three Democrats and one Republican the other Republican commissioner resigned earlier this year On Thursday October the sole Republican Commissioner Curt Hebert Jr gave a presentation to members of the Greater Houston Partnership on the subject of Competition and Americas Energy Policy While his opinions are not necessarily representative of the FERC as a whole Hebert clearly supports regulatory flexibility and free markets but is also sensitive to environmental issues He is also vehemently opposed to price controls such as electricity price caps in New England New York and California Hebert believes that the recent electricity price spikes in the West this past summer were great market indicators that electric generation is in short supply particularly during periods of hot weather In the summer of the Midwest experienced similar price spikes also related to summer heat The difference between the two situations is that the Midwest allowed the market to decide which responded with new generation projects but California imposed price controls on electricity that have had the affect of discouraging new generation Thus the short supply situation in California may just get worse The FERC has completed an investigation of the recent electricity price spikes in California but does not intend to release its findings to the general public While we believe that the FERC will find a way to help resolve the situation in that state any actions would not likely take affect until In the interim the electric utilities are suffering under a growing burden of uncollected power purchase costs and are calling on the state regulators to provide emergency financial relief Proposals include a refundable rate surplus removal of frozen rates andor the deferral of stranded cost recovery We are doubtful that the FERC will rule on any action prior to the elections because political considerations may influence their decisions Commissioner Hebert indicated that this was an opportunity for the FERC to send to the electricity industry a signal on what may make the markets work and believe that any plan should be bold ambitious and strict in requiring results Renewable fuels are also likely to be encouraged although this is not necessarily good news for the natural gas industry and old issues like the Fuel Use Act and the Btu tax may resurface Ideally the FERC would endorse market pricing and encourage the development of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure However by doing so the FERC may be perceived as the bad guy which may not be ideal image in an election year However Hebert is hopeful that the FERC will move beyond politics and make the right regulatory decision for the long term The benefits of price controls are short term and those markets under price caps may be disadvantages as the rest of the US opens to electric competition Prudential Securities Incorporated or one of its affiliates or subsidiaries or its officers directors analysts employees agents independent contractors or consultants may have positions in securities or commodities referred to herein and may as

POINTS The Second Time Around Still Looks Good ENE has cut another deal on Portland General Electric PGE this time with Northwest Natural Gas NWN Div yield The deal size is billion The original deal in November was for billion with Sierra Pacific Resources SRP Div yield This was mm better than we expected in our September report which upgraded ENE to a Strong Buy This deal has very few externalities and should close twelve months hence Both companies are Oregonbased and should get a better regulatory break than ENE did when it bought PGE in July The impact on ENE Very little gain or loss on sale of the assets Interest expense reductions should largely offset expected mm after tax annual PGE earnings contribution A better balance sheet with total leverage dropping from to if done today This is a step in the right direction PGE will be in much better hands to pursue its Oregon agenda and ENE will look better without PGEs presence We continue to rate ENE a Strong Buy up to it becomes a Buy from to Our month price target is Current Events The deal is straightforward NWN will raise billion in cash mm in Feline Prides and will issue mm in NWN stock to Enron NWN will assume the residual mm obligation inflicted on ENE by the Oregon PUC as the price of regulatory peace ie ransom demands at the time of the original acquisition This brings the total purchase price to billion for PGEs billion of common equity NWN will assume billion of total debt and mm of straight preferreds The pricetobook is PGE has been earning in the mm mm aftertax area although the numbers may work higher this year mm because of FASB marktomarket profits on longerdated power trading of mm being realized so far The approximate PE is about x forecasts The electric group is now trading at x Es and x Es The regulatory due process should take about months There are no looming rate cases ROE or capital structure issues The OPUC ranks very low among state PUCs in terms of providing fair or competitive ROEs for investors We were pleased to learn that the OPUC has finally ditched the CAPM capital asset pricing model as a worthless relic for determining costs of capital and has embraced discounted cash flow methodology The bad news was that this still didnt prevent the OPUC from rolling over PGE in its August rate case settlement dropping the allowed ROE from to The annualized earnings impact looks like mm aftertax Given the very parochial nature of the Oregon retail energy market there is no question in our mind that this should be a worthwhile deal for NWN and a win for ENE as well If the deal were closed today ENE would deleverage to the tune of the billion proceeds or from to total leverage It would also trade up ENEs unnecessarily low composite ROE from the area to something better PGEs secular growth rate is annually in rate base terms and its EBIT contribution would run only of ENEs totals in There would be very little book gain or loss on the sale and the billion of underlying goodwill on the PGE assets will disappear ENE had to reincorporate in Oregon at the time of the PGE purchase Chances are that it will be a Delaware corporation by this time next year On the other hand NWN has seized a very good but highly leveraged opportunity Both managements are largely in sync covering much of the same ground already The synergies can be meaningful NWNs asset base would more than triple from billion to about billion In essence NWNs mm rate base will be joined with PGEs rate base of billion and NWN would have tripled its rate base to billion About mm of goodwill will be created in the process NWN is funding the deal with debt and a mandatory convertible preferred and with common equity It will set up a new upstream corporation and presumably do a Section acquisition The two subsidiaries will then be merged into NewCo and that name will be changed back to NWN NWNs total capital structure at midyear ran total debtpreferredscommon equity The pro forma structure should run If shortterm debt is excluded the structure becomes Each subsidiary of NewCo will continue with about leverage but the parent will look more like an LBO Is this bad We dont think so because NWN is buying mm of earnings and may pay out about mm mm in aftertax interest expense and thanks to FASB there would be no goodwill amortization Newco will have almost entirely

came after shares of several companies active in the converging natural gas and power sectors took a severe hit Monday in response to concerns that the regulators would cap power prices which would limit revenue from gasfired generation investments Shares of Dynegy Inc DYN dropped on Monday while Enron Corp ENE and El Paso Energy Corp EPG saw their stocks fall and Calpine Corp CPN took the

Thoughts on the California Energy Crisis the FERC Settlement Negotiations and Wholesale Energy Companies BLAME CANADA Curiously Absent in the California Debate MOVING BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE Will the FERC Settlement Process Prevent Governor Davis from Leading the Industry and the State of California Over the Precipice CONFUSING NUMBERS There are admittedly a lot of numbers floating out there with respect to the California Power Crisis The administrative law judge ADL for the FERC Curtis L Wagner Jr is currently kneedeep in these numbers and allegations as he attempts to reach a settlement between the various sides of this issue during a compact day settlement period mandated by the FERC The deadline for this settlement if July th if no settlement is reached the FERC has threatened to impose its own solution which would most likely lead to a protracted legal battle that could play out over several years California Dreaming Billion But Where Does the Number Come From One thing does appear to be clear here no one including Judge Wagner appears to have any idea where this billion number which Governor Davis and his compatriots keep quoting comes from According to the information we have obtained the total amount of Estimated Wholesale Revenues Above Competitive Market Baseline pre and post Oct for the generators over which the FERC has jurisdictional control is around billion However as has already been pointed out many times the FERC can only order refunds from Oct of last year onward due to a Federal law which requires a filing for refunds to be made within days of the purchases the CA ISO didnt begin appealing for refunds until Dec of Therefore looking at the OctFeb time period the amount involved appears to be more like billion for generators over which the FERC has jurisdictional control For all generators the numbers look more like billion for the OctFeb time period and billion for the entire period May through Feb Its worth noting that none of the generating companies know where any of these numbers from the CA ISO come from and what the bases of any of these calculations are For now these numbers appear to be just another data point in the negotiations although they clearly do appear to undermine the Californias position on the billion refund its demanding Judge Wagner has already appeared to put out one data point in the negotiations stating at the outset that the California is owed refunds of course California hasnt paid its bills yet on this issue so calling this a refund is a bit disingenuous of perhaps a billion dollars or so according to the Wall Street Journal We believe that this represents one line of demarcation being set out by the judge early on to encourage both sides in this debate Known reserves or quoted reserves taken by generators or wholesale energy companies involved total more than billion and of course that doesnt include everyone since there are a number of generators involved who arent or havent disclosed any information Reserved Amounts Amounts Owed to Generators by CA ISO Alleged Overcharge Computed by CA ISO No Wonder Investors Having Been Steering Clear Based on our conversations with investors over the past several weeks it appears that many investors see good value in some of the wholesale energy companies and independent power producers at current levels but the problem is the political uncertainty Emerging Markets political psychology has now become a part of valuing these companies as it relates to the third world nature of the California power system This is in line with what we began to warn investors about several weeks ago with respect to this crisis but it also could represent an excellent buying opportunities in certain names We continue to believe that somehow someone or something in the case of the FERC will eventually lead us back from the precipice from where Governor Davis has been taking this issue Alongside a potential resolution of this case through the current settlement negotiations strong second quarter earnings from these companies could also provide a catalyst If we were to assume that the ultimate settlement figure were to be less than this floated figure by Judge Wagner at the outset of this settlement process then on the face of it the generators would appear to be more than fully reserved on this issue However that assumes that a settlement can be reached in the allotted days that is not more than billion and also assumes that each companies established reserves or lack of reserves proves to be in line this last area being the most doubtful As an example Enron ENE Attractive Rated has according to the company booked reserves on this issue of million while it claims to be owed million by the CA ISO However the alleged overcharge by Enron by the CA ISO is only million Enron it would appear from these numbers could stand to make a windfall from these settlement negotiations On the other hand Reliant REI Not Rated appears to have reserved just million but claims to be owed million by the CA ISO The CA ISO however appears to be claiming that REI overcharged it by million although realistically the figure here we should focus on is million based on the Oct Feb time period The problem is of course no one knows how the CA ISOs figures were calculated let along Governor Davis has lifted his billion figure from Breaking Down the Numbers In the enclosed excel file we have broken down information where available for the various wholesale energy companies and independent power producers with respect to alleged overcharge by the CA ISO the reported EBIT for these companies in fiscal year the amount that these companies have claimed is owed them by the CA ISO and the approximate reserves each of these companies has taken with respect to this issue In many cases these are obviously not hard data points since they cant be readily located in filings by these companies with the SEC Some of the figures come from various public statements made by the heads of these companies or are lifted from articles where they were attributed to someone at these companies Attached File Please Request File Separately in the Case of First Call Note The Camouflaged Canadians It has been interesting to read through articles regarding the California Power crisis and even to watch supposedly well researched documentaries that are expected to present a balanced thorough account of what has been and what continues to happen in California and throughout the Western United States This is a complicated subject a complicated chain of events which has led to this crisis but it is still stunning at times to see major issues missed by the press or ignored by the California Governors office in assessing this issue More often than not the hydroelectric system in the Pacific Northwest and the integral role it plays in supplying California power during the summer doesnt get adequate attention nor does the hydro system of our neighbors up north You want to know who has made the most money yet off the California Power Crisis look north For obvious political and legal reasons Governor Davis in California has pointed the finger solely and continually at Houston Texas However perhaps Governor Davis andor the rest of California should perhaps focus some attention on Canada if they want to determine who gained the most from this crisis Through the first threequarters of BC Hydros net income increased by close to million on a yy basis According to info we have seen related to the California ISO calculations regarding potential overcharges that appears to be the single largest amount of money made from the California Energy Crisis we have assumed for now in this statement that California would deem all of the increase in profit on a yy basis to be illegally gained which is admittedly an overstatement but then again these figures for BC Hydro dont include fourth quarter results for whereas the Ca ISO comparison figures do Fourth quarter results for BC Hydro are not expected to be reported until somewhere on July but we would expect the fourth quarter to be a whopping number The attached excel sheet provides more data but the quarterly net incomes for BC Hydro and yy increases were as follows Q million up yy Q million up yy Q million up yy Q According to the information we have been able to find it looks as if BC Hydro announced two rebates to their Canadian customers during which look to total around Billion Canadians dont vote in Californias Gubernatorial race nor will they be allowed to vote in the Presidential Election in this country And although were not lawyers it seems that is would be more than a little difficult for Governor Davis to sue Canadians and their ratepayers for a return of these rebates Perhaps we quibble but it would appear to be selective prosecution on the part of the California politicians But then again perhaps

Hysteria Causing Wholesale Heartburn The Williams Capital Group Power Natural Gas Chris Ellinghaus Houston Hysteria Causing Wholesale Heartburn October Balance sheet issues at Enron ENE NR have triggered investor concerns regarding nonpayment of receivables held by trading counterparties like Calpine Dynegy Mirant and NRG We do not believe any trading counter party to Enron has a daily valueatrisk VAR of more than million and most company risk management controls are considerably more restrictive We estimate that the majority of trading counter parties have exposure of roughly one month of receivables to Enron which we believe would be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars range at worst The market is concerned that potential cash flow issues at Enron could spread to other wholesale energy marketers and IPPs Concerns have surfaced that trading counterparties might restrict Enrons trading access or require additional credit to support its wholesale energy trading business Unsubstantiated rumors suggest that some counterparties may have cut off Enrons credit The concern is that a potential liquidity crunch at Enron could ultimately lead to nonpayment of receivables held by trading counterparties like Calpine Dynegy Mirant or NRG While we agree that in the event of a worst case outcome some of the uncertainties related to Enrons financing needs could have credit implications for its trading partners in our opinion a multitude of negative events would have to occur before Enrons receivables might be deemed uncollectible Counterparty risk is largely limited to trade receivables and not open market positions We know of no industry counterparties to Enron that have a daily valueatrisk VAR of more than million and most risk management controls are considerably less Enron represents a relatively small proportion of each counterparties daily VAR due to concentration controls Therefore daily VAR related to Enron should be limited The greater potential credit risk lies within the trade receivables each counterparty might have with Enron Trading receivables are typically collected within days of the trade date We believe few counterparties would have materially more than a single months worth of trading exposure to Enron at any given time We believe that most counterparties would have at most a couple of hundred million dollars of receivable exposure to Enron per month We would expect few of Enrons trading partners businesses to be seriously jeopardized as a result of a potential Enron default Yesterday the stocks of some of Enrons chief counterparties fell precipitously Dynegy fell the most declining or almost Dynegy clearly is a large counterparty to Enrons trading desk but we doubt that the magnitude of Dynegys receivables risk to Enron is remotely equal to the billion of market capitalization that Dynegy lost yesterday Mirants stock price fell or reflecting a decline in market capitalization of over million We believe that the energy marketers as a whole have more exposure to Enrons trading desk than the IPPs Calpine and NRG are significantly smaller counterparties to Enron than the larger energy marketers Calpine disclosed in its second quarter Q that it transacted over million in the first half of with Enron Assuming that Calpines receivable exposure was equally distributed monthly and currently running at a similar rate Calpines receivable exposure to Enron would equal only about million Calpines market value dropped over million yesterday None of the counterparties we spoke to over the last couple of days would disclose their current receivables exposure to Enron In our opinion the uncertainty of the amounts in question have contributed to an overreaction by the market to
