release File INDIA EOGIL NEW AGREEMENT DRAFT doc Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To McMahon Jeffrey Cc Detmering Tim Wallace Stephen Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL sale to BG Jeff FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India See Tims note below I spoke to Ray by telephoneon his way to the airport regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering To paraphrase Rays comments to my note below a he is working with the creditors committee on the DO issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the ongoing business At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in midFebruary b the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today As a nondebtor we plan to honor the agreements but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP The hearing date will be in midFebruary Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow form of agreement This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing However BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW A COPY IS ATTACHED WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR John Ambler Johan Zaayman and the working group and now the two of you Do we need to send it elsewhere Well circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim Stephen or I jeff Original Message From Sherrick Jeffrey Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Subject FW EOGIL With respect to the note below we have done the following this morning We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review There are a couple of different documents Retention agreements divestiture agreements and the only differences being names and amounts We have also sent her any associated agreements extensions and assignment She indicated she would review this afternoon My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank None of the people on this list participated in the prepetition retention Lilly has asked about Futhermore none of these people are part of the future plan if there is one to the best of my knowledge On DO supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors see the need for such a plan but they dont want a one off plan as well It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines Once we have the compensation and the DO issue resolved we can notify BG and sign this deal I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues ok on bonuses letter in lieu of DO policy if you can Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion they are just creditor committee issues jeff Original Message From Detmering Tim Sent Tuesday January PM To Bowen Jr Raymond Brian Rosen Email Steve Zelin Email Cc Wallace Stephen Davis Steve Sherrick Jeffrey Harper Stephen Subject EOGIL Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan The Creditors Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations Escrow the proceeds DO insurance will be addressed in the future Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once ie people who got a piece of the prepetition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenrohts mistake I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time Therefore the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds does not provide for separate DO insurance and does not address the deal compensation
