<5949134.1075840837328.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,raymond.bowen@enron.com,2001-12-05 08:28:57,New Cash Conrol Process pm Meeting December in the th floor Board Room Cc Overview Our bankruptcy filing requires a cultural change in the cash management pro cedures of Enron Because of our fiduciary obligation to our creditors we now must move to centralized cash management These new procedures will a mend our prior policy As management of the Debtor we should approach e ach decision about our business including cash receipts and disbursements from the perspective of Does this enhance the value of the Debtors esta te This memo addresses the new policies that are to be immediately imple mented both for entities in the Chapter reorganization and entities that have not filed There will be a meeting Wednesday December at PM in the Board Room on the th floor to discuss the new policies As a debtorinpossession DIP we have new cash flow reporting obligati ons and we must develop and adhere to a cash flow budget Failure to adher e could have serious consequences to our DIP financing availability as well as diminish our credibility with the creditors with whom we must negotiate our ultimate exit from Chapter as a reorganized entity All Enron business units not just the ones in bankruptcy will need to con form to these new requirements because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important f or Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirement s for the Company There are special procedures outlined at the end of the memo specifically r elating to the business units in bankruptcy the Debtor business units New Processes and Procedures Until further notice a newly formed committee the Cash Flow Management Co mmittee the Committee will meet daily to review and approve daily paym ents and day projections for each business unit The Committee will be h eaded by George Wasaff and will also consist of Ray Bowen Dave Gorte Tim DeSpain Bob Butts Julia Murray and Lisa Mellencamp The Committee will b e assisted by our financial advisor Batchelder Partners and our outside counsel Weil Gotshal Manges The Committee will review payments only a fter approval by the business units Business units remain responsible for their own internal approval processes George Wasaff will be the Companys Cash Czar His responsibilities will include i a review of weekly cash budgets from all business units ii presentation of weekly budgets to the Committee for approval iii a revie w of daily disbursements for the current and immediately succeeding days an d iv comparison of actual to budget variances for cash receipts and disbu rsements As outlined in Rick Causeys memo of December all business units m ust provide weekly cash flow projections Each weeks submission should be accompanied by a sufficiently detailed explanation of any variances betwee n budget and actual cash receipts and disbursements for the preceding week Further details of the exact requirements and format of these projections will be provided at the meeting All divisions must also provide rolling day cash flow projections through the intranet system by am each day These day projections must inc lude a projection of all cash receipts and disbursements for the subsequent business days Copies of all supporting documentation should be sent to George Wasaff Mary Perkins and Tim DeSpain Each business unit will be responsible for prescreening weekly budgets and eliminating any nonessent ial payments This projection should agree to weekly cash flow projections provided on each Friday for the ensuing calendar week with variances clear ly identified By working with day rolling projections we can eliminate the last minute scramble to assure that the payment is consistent with ou r situation In order to be eligible for payment items must appear on the weekly and da ily cash flow projections Failure to include on both will result in nonp ayment Since our payments are subject to heightened scrutiny our general rule is that the practice of same day and manual wires will be discontinue d In addition please flag any payments made to related parties as these may require separate reporting to the Court Any questions on this process should be routed to George Wasaff Special Procedures for Debtors Companies in bankruptcy See the attached Exhibit A for a list of the current Debtor Companies Add itional companies may be added with each having its own petition date As a general rule we are legally prohibited from paying any prepetition liab ilities The standard for what constitutes prepetition is Were goods delivered to Enron prior to December or specific pe tition date for entities filing after Dec Were services provided prior to the petition date If requests for payment are not clear the business unit must contact v endors and request them to provide an invoice signed by an officer statin g what portion of the goods or services were delivered prepetition If you are unsure or have any questions please contact George Wasaff You must segregate any prepetition claims for payment In virtually all c ases these claims will not appear on the cash disbursement list because we are generally prohibited from making payment However the Company does ha ve very limited authority to make payment to prepetition vendors deemed to be critical In order for a prepetition disbursement to be approved s uch disbursement must make sound business and operational sense be mission critical and there must not be a substitute vendor The bu siness unit heads will be responsible for ensuring that recommendations to the Committee for any disbursements to critical prepetition vendors meet t his test The Committees presumption will be that a vendor is not critica l If you believe that a prepetition claim clearly meets the critical t est you may submit it as a clearly flagged item stating your reasons for requested payment The Committee and corporate management will consider th ese recommendations by the business unit Internal Controls We need to reassess internal controls and determine if changes are required especially in light of recent personnel changes All internal controls new and existing will be subject to review by Andrew Parsons He will be communicating with you regarding his assessment and requirements for any ch anges to be made I look forward to seeing you this afternoon at the meeting Exhibit A Enron Entities that Have Filed Filed December Enron Metals
