document opportunity costs in the NW and the SW If you have questions as to what is just and reasonable give me Bill Steve Hall or Tim B a call Note the penalties mentioned in and We will not dec load until futher notice as we dont have the telemetry to accurately measure whether we are long or short in any given instance Our company preschedules an amount of energy necessary to cover forecasted load If this load is higher we will be subject to the penalties listed below The Real Time group will not expose company to any such charges See There are Services related penalties for all generators that dont respond to ISO ADS instructions As everyone is aware the ISO has had problems with this system We must be diligent in documenting all problems with ADS as this can be a very costly disagreement JMF Forwarded by John M ForneyHOUECT on AM Steve C Hall PM To Tim CT Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT John M CT Greg CT Mary CT Elizabeth CT cc Subject ISO Emergency Tariff Modifications Tariff Amendment On Friday about pm the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes some of which are effective as of December beginning HE and others that take effect Tuesday December As a consequence we no longer have the luxury of waiting until Jan to start documenting certain costs we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the soft cap immediately I understand that at least some of the traders have been informed of these changes but I thought that it might be helpful for everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing The ISO has changed the hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap Its similar to the FERCs proposed soft cap in its Nov Order Sellers can bid over for supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids If the ISO accepts a bid greater than settlement will be asbid and subject to refund if costs cannot be verified SCs must submit cost documentation to the FERC ISO and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy dispatched in excess of the soft cap Effective December Beginning Trade Day December the ISO is going to charge SCs who underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time based on each SCs net regional negative uninstructed deviations Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations is a new ISO defined term see below These SCs will be charged for amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy from bids above the price cap and costs for Energy associated with outofmarket Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to respond The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the ISO advance notice of a derate or outage that would limit the Generators ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction If the outage or derate occurs in realtime then a reason code provided with a decline or partial acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will be assessed subject to some additional conditions If the ISO has to curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency the Generator will pay an additional penalty of MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver Bilateral arrangements with the ISO ie out of market purchases will not be altered by the ISOs Amendment From December the ISO paid an average of million per day for real time energy On December th the ISO paid million and on December th million The published ex post price will not exceed There is still a hard cap of on Ancillary Services capacity bids Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations Penalties for being short in realtime either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward markets that does not show up are based on net deviations for each BEEP interval based on an SCs entire portfolio including Load Generation Imports and Exports Action We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately Much of the groundwork for figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the realtime and services desks but we need to make sure that someone is collecting this information on a daily basis For now I am willing to be the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the appropriate agencies but eventually someone from the floor should take on this responsibility I will be here early on Monday and we can coordinate our efforts then Steve

Tariff Amendment On Friday about pm the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes some of which are effective as of December beginning HE and others that take effect Tuesday December As a consequence we no longer have the luxury of waiting until Jan to start documenting certain costs we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the soft cap immediately I understand that at least some of the traders have been informed of these changes but I thought that it might be helpful for everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing The ISO has changed the hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap Its similar to the FERCs proposed soft cap in its Nov Order Sellers can bid over for supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids If the ISO accepts a bid greater than settlement will be asbid and subject to refund if costs cannot be verified SCs must submit cost documentation to the FERC ISO and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy dispatched in excess of the soft cap Effective December Beginning Trade Day December the ISO is going to charge SCs who underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time based on each SCs net regional negative uninstructed deviations Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations is a new ISO defined term see below These SCs will be charged for amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy from bids above the price cap and costs for Energy associated with outofmarket Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to respond The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the ISO advance notice of a derate or outage that would limit the Generators ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction If the outage or derate occurs in realtime then a reason code provided with a decline or partial acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will be assessed subject to some additional conditions If the ISO has to curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency the Generator will pay an additional penalty of MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver Bilateral arrangements with the ISO ie out of market purchases will not be altered by the ISOs Amendment From December the ISO paid an average of million per day for real time energy On December th the ISO paid million and on December th million The published ex post price will not exceed There is still a hard cap of on Ancillary Services capacity bids Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations Penalties for being short in realtime either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward markets that does not show up are based on net deviations for each BEEP interval based on an SCs entire portfolio including Load Generation Imports and Exports Action We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately Much of the groundwork for figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the realtime and services desks but we need to make sure that someone is collecting this information on a daily basis For now I am willing to be the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the appropriate agencies but eventually someone from the floor should
