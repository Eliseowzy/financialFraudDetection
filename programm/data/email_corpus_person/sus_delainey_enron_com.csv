your head in wonder Subject FW DARWIN AWARDS Hot off the press The Darwin Awards Are Here The latest Darwin Awards update A Canadian man searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply because he had no money with which to buy alcohol mixed gasoline with milk Not surprisingly this concoction made him ill and he vomited into the fireplace in his house This resulting explosion and fire burned his house down killing both him and his sister A yearold white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation according to police He was approximately tall and weighed pounds He was wearing a pleated skirt white bra black and white saddle shoes and a womans wig It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirls uniform look He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place The other end of the hose was connected to a one end of a hollow wooden tube approx long and in diameter The tubes other end was inserted into his rear end for reasons unknown and was the cause of his suffocation Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family very awkward Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude when another plane approached It appears that they decided to moon the occupants of the other plane but lost control of their own aircraft and crashed They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants around their ankles A police officer in Ohio responded to a call She had no details before arriving except that someone had reported that his father was not breathing Upon arrival the officer found the man face down on the couch naked When she rolled him over to check for a pulse and to start CPR she noticed burn marks around his genitals After the ambulance arrived and removed the man who was declared dead on arrival at the hospital the police made a closer inspection of the couch and noticed that the man had made a hole between the cushions Upon flipping the couch over they discovered what caused his death Apparently the man had a habit of putting his penis between the cushions down into the hole and between two electrical sanders with the sandpaper removed for obvious reasons According to the story after his orgasm the discharge shorted out one of the sanders electrocuting him A yearold French woman lost control of her car on a highway near Marseilles and crashed into a tree seriously injuring her passenger and killing herself As a commonplace road accident this would not have qualified for a Darwin nomination were it not for the fact that the drivers attention had been distracted by her Tamagotchi key ring which had started urgently beeping for food as she drove along In an attempt to press the correct buttons to save the Tamagotchis life the woman lost her own A yearold Reston VA man was found dead after he tried to use octopus straps to bungee jump off a foot railroad trestle Fairfax County police said Eric Barcia a fastfood worker taped a bunch of these straps together wrapped an end around one foot anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park jumped and hit the pavement Warren Carmichael a police spokesman said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby The length of the cord that he had assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground Carmichael said Police say the apparent cause of death was Major trauma A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites It seems that he and a friend were playing a game of catch using the rattlesnake as a ball The friend no doubt a future Darwin Awards candidate was hospitalised Employees in a mediumsized warehouse in west Texas noticed the smell of a gas leak Sensibly management evacuated the building extinguishing all potential sources of ignition lights power etc After the building had been evacuated two technicians from the gas company were dispatched Upon entering the building they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark To their frustration none of the lights worked you can see whats coming cant you Witnesses later described the sight of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a cigarette lighter Upon operation of the lighterlike object the gas in the warehouse exploded sending pieces of it up to three miles away Nothing was found of the technicians but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion The technician suspected of causing the blast had never been thought of as bright by his peers
