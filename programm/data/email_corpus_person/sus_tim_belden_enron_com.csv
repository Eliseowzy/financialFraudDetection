the load side rather than the supply side The IOUs continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price There is evidence that the IOUs are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap The NOx market in California is very tight How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective I can go into more detail if you wish Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets For example why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on and There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about MW from the NW TO California Demand Side we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is workably competitive then there is no need for price caps Is largescale economic demand response required for a competitive market What if demand response is there but at very high prices The demand response in California is a joke With MW of interuptible why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around MW of economic demand response Much of this response comes at MWh The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds but not economic grounds So why this assymetric treatment This gets to the question of the fine line between scarcity rents which are ok and market power which is not If power is scarce and demand truly values it at MWh then shouldnt that be the price At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail Bottom line there are about MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than MWh Burden of proof what empirical measures should be used to assess market power The reports published to date have been unimpressive The Market Analysis Unit report for example does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power But they never explain why I would think that proof might be something like this Generator X sets price y of the time when loads exceed Z MWs Or four generators set price of the time when prices exceed MWh They have all the data to be able to tell yet they dont provide any empirical measures The only test Ive heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year They fail to mention the fact that there are fewer MW of

asking Western power market participants The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask Im sure there are more Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead market How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during Has PGE changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities in Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in than in Were any generation plants offline due to unplanned maintenance during Summer How did the CA ISO demand side program work Why didnt more load participate What options did SDGE have to hedge its retail rates What were prices in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan and May How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during Summer Were other Western power markets prices higher yearonyear Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps Is this appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity What specific details is SDGE referring to in its Complaint on unworkably competitive CA ISO markets Can these be fixed quickly Please add other questions Jim

the people we have identified who deserve them and havent received them and I need to know that the comp conveyed to me in is secure It is unlikely that I would be here today if it werent for the collective comp conveyed to me during I have received assurances from the two of you Oxley and Greg at different times as to the security of the comp received The messages generally start with its safe dont worry about it all comp paid in advanced the interest of shareholders and the estate low probability that there will be any issues At other times particularly when you want me to commit to this deal the logic changes The comp paid in becomes risky and will become a whole lot safer if Im on the team While I recognize that Enron is a very strange and fluid place these days it appears that at times the story changes depending on what you want me to do When I ask for indemnification on comp paid to me in the answer is that it is off the table a nonstarter Why Because the estate is negotiating the deal Then have them negotiate that on behalf of me Because the buyer has no interest in legacy issues with the estate I wouldnt be here but for the legacy issues with the estate it is definitely the buyers issue Because people have too much to do to get this deal done to take the time to negotiate with each employee I am available at any time wherever you want me to be to discuss this matter if and when the estatethe buyer have time Because we dont know who from the buyer to negotiate with Someone from the buyer has to decide on comp and contract issues why not figure it out now Because this deal is bigger than Tim Belden Im not delusional I know that this is a big deal with a lot of moving parts If its bigger than me then it will likely move forward without me Since I am not on the team right now I am also working with a great deal less information than you have I respect your choice to differentiate the information disseminated to people on the team versus not on the team However the consequences of that choice provide less information to me which creates a greater leap of faith in my mind For example I have no idea how the mechanics of getting these options done conveyed to the creditorsbuyerestatejudge works Louise inidicated that it would be a memo or some form of written document indicating the people and total dollars needed to secure them If thats the case you could add my indemnification amount adjusted by probability of payout to that total and it surely wouldnt blow up the deal Unless the probability of payout is high Furthermore I am not proposing that we change the basic employment doc subject to comment from my lawyer but Ill try to keep immaterial changes to a minimum I am saying that a condition precedent for me is to negotiate a separate indemnification doc with the buyer At that point in time I would hope that they have the time and the inclination to discuss such a doc Perhaps at that time some of the comp issues will already be cleared through the bankruptcy judge making the discussion that much easier Based on various discussions with the two of you over the last couple of weeks I have been led to believe that such a decision is expected and perhaps imminent I dont understand why this is a nonstarter issue but I dont have the same information that you do To be clear here is the basic deal that I am willing to offer as a free option to the buyer the deal as it exists plus retention payments for those still with the company who deserve them who have not yet received them indemnification of comp up to million I expect that the two of you will tell me that Im not on the team that people are going home and that the Portland office will be moved to Houston if this thing survives That is not what I want to happen If this deal is bigger than me then those things shouldnt happen I have given this a lot of thought over the last couple of days and came up with my conclusions I am open to any productive discussions that you would like to have In talking through this stuff with Mike and Matt I realize what a hard position you guys are in I feel that I have lost ground rather than gain ground with them in the last couple of days I trust that you are trying to do the right thing There are just so many things that are uncertain right now that it makes it very difficult for me to give away the option that you have requested without firming up some other issues for me at the same time Finally I apologize for hanging up on Louise ealier Its probably better than me hearing what she was about to say and her hearing what I was about to say I will call to see that you received and read this email I am comfortable with whatever you decide to do Tim

Williams III Bill Wolfe Greg Subject Energy Novice to Be Paid Good work if you can find it Wednesday July Energy Novice to Be Paid Power Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months

Subject WPTF Friday Thin Quality Burrito Hey Burrito Heads ItFs just another fascinating week in Burrito land I spent the better part of this week learning something new which at my age is not easy In fact just about everything at my age is getting more difficult But I wont bore you with the details The new thing I learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this yearFs California GovernorFs Quality Education and Development Award CalQED Its an annual shindig for companies health care institutions and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the GovFs hand and hearing that your pick one company nonprofit school health care institution are world class Being an examiner of the written applications and working with a team of peer examiners is all pro bono on my part I am wondering what the hell I got myself into IFll tell you more about it some other time Speaking of world class I got two top notch letters this week that I want to share with you One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing and Trading regarding the May overscheduling on the Silver Peak intertie by MW see Lori EckmanFs note to me in last weekFs Burrito and a reply to KenFs letter from George Sladoje CEO of the PX Ken who I have known for several years is a person who doesnFt speak out unless something really bothers him Ken wrote FSince Day Ive always wondered what mechanism was in place to protect against this scenario overscheduling on an intertie or if this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or feature I always figured it was a feature simply because I didnt think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked I also figured that this feature was available for use by market participants and that if it became overused that it would eventually come under scrutiny by the market compliance police I also wondered if people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve their overall positions I also figured that for the most part there is no such thing as artificially high prices since in my opinion the market design itself is somewhat artificial But now I know the truthits a flaw it was overlooked and there is no protectionamazing FI certainly do not agree with George Sladojes interpretation of the PX tariff that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper implementation of a generator schedule which therefore constitutes a violation of the tariff Also I believe that it is completely inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest on the shoulders of the market participants ie if someone types in an incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application the market should not blowup The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with the market operator PX itself PX software should validate that the proper mechanics have been used by the market participants FBy the way it wasnt us who caused this situation and of course we would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high but if we review this situation and retroactively recreate prices then perhaps all other cases in which congestion at tiepoints caused high prices should also be reviewed to see if they are real FBy the way typically I would not respond to this sort of thing due to time constraints however some of our recent involvement in other ISOPXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other ISOPXs Each of them including California has its strengths and weaknesses however its in California where the unusual is the normF I sent KenFs letter to George and his staff at the PX and George wrote back the following FBecause the incident of May is the subject of an official investigation by the PX Compliance unit I cannot comment on the specifics of this matter at this time It is likely that the CalPX Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the ISO do the same FI disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision does not apply here In all major exchange operations the institution not only provides a forum for trading but also monitors the activities of its members both currently and after the fact The participants are expected to follow the rules At one of my previous employers as an example the Chicago Board of Trade a suspected abuse or a compliant from another member or customer results in an investigation by the Office of Investigations and Audits the counterpart of CalPXFs Compliance unit Depending on the nature of the issue the investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee These bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if the issue requires Board of Director action FSimilarly the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions against participants who violate tariff provisions Our recently filed sanctionFs protocol formalizes the process further and describes a series of penalties which can be imposed Therefore we believe our tariff does provide adequate protection FFinally as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market design Obviously impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have happened as a result of free and open markets Congestion has become an almost regular occurrence The real issues under investigation in this incident are magnitude intent and materiality of impact on our marketplaceF Thank you both Ken and George for those comments I am sure we will hear from other members on the issue Lori donFt be silent You started this thing DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDD Speaking of market design segues I am very big on segues this week old warrior dear friend and defender of the just Carl Imparato had a few things to say about the ISOFs proposed utilization of ex post GMMs Carl wrote FYesterday the ISO Market Analysis Unit stated that not implementing afterthefact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the California market structure FEx post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure When I was at PGE and we were developing the tariff in early no one not at PGE SCE or any other market participant to my knowledge ever advocated ex post GMMs and they were NOT included in the tariff I dont recall the words state estimator for calculation such GMMs ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting FIt was only somewhere in mid when Alex was working on UFE equations that Alex I believe suddenly came up with the proposal for ex post GMMs and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly before it had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum and was adopted by the ISO Board or whatever group passed for the Board at that time Immediately thereafter virtually everyone in SCUG We were ignored FBut even in early we informally agreed that in light of the facts that afterthefact GMMs were not part of the original deal afterthefact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved forwardF I remember those discussions Carl I wonder if deals made in have any meaning today DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD The SCE Pilot Forwards Program a continuing saga for WPTF popped up again this week I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to encourage him to stay the course and support the ALJFs preliminary decision to reject SCEFs Application and cancel the hearings on legal and procedural grounds Dick said that he supported that notion but he couldnFt guarantee that all his colleagues would Alas two days later Commissioner Joe Neeper who clearly had too much time on his hands this week issued a public statement which is long but here is a taste FALJ HaleFs Proposed Decision PD is structured so that a Yes vote will terminate the proceeding and a No vote will continue the proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution I have concerns wit h the PD However I do not intend to issue an alternate because should my concerns not be addressed I have the option to vote No which would have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written FIf we vote to allow this application to move to hearings we can later determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy grounds The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not comply with what is known as the buysell requirement for utilities to sell all of their generation into and purchase all of their energy needs for their bundled customers out of the PX I agree with the ALJ and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be compatible with the buysell requirement in order to be approved and that this threshold decision is therefore necessary FThe PD concludes that the Application makes SCEFs customers more vulnerable to market power abuseIn viewing the comments of parties I find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by Western Power Trading Forum WPTF in its opening brief WPTF states on page that under SCEFs proposal ESPs will no longer be able to compete with utilities on the basis of shortrun incremental costs in an open setting as envisioned by the PPDThus ESPs would find it increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail market in which ESPs must participate The PX price is determined in an open setting and would continue to be determined in an open setting under SCEFs proposalI cannot find that the proposal would violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power Market power concerns should be considered and weighed against consumer and other interests These issues certainly can be explored in greater depth as policy matters in hearings FI do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the CommissionFs Preferred Policy Decision The merits of the Applicatio n should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the Commissioners F Well Mr Neeper justice isnFt free A hearing is expensive and what your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the gameunnecessarily That supports the incumbents UDCs and hurts us At the time I am writing this Burrito I do not know if the Commission took action on this matter today or punted it to the July meeting IFll keep you posted next week DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last week First Dynegy and Illinova are merging and second NEV is being purchased by AES Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF I was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF but now I think IFll take that off my Fto doFlist In the NEV deal the AES Corporation announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures in a transaction valued at approximately million AES will acquire all of the outstanding shares of New Energy Ventures from its current owners UniSource Energy Corporation and New Energy Holdings LLC which is owned by senior management of New Energy Ventures This is an incredible coincidence I was just telling someone I think it was Dan Douglass that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day of NEV who is a big fan of the Burrito and quite possibly although I am not certain one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation Well heck she has been at NEV from the beginning so she deserves all the financial success in the world and we wish her well I just want to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF a taxexempt nonprofit corporation Tax ID right here in the State of California soon to be a CalQED award winner is looking for donors for the soontobeannounced Executive DirectorFs fund Some of you might not know about this new slush fund It is intended to provide all the necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting and who want to discuss high level stuff all through the night WhatFs an executive director to do So Nancy I was just thinking we could launch this program in your honor with your name all over the thing and get this very important and much needed program in place At least it will pay for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these meetings on my hotelroom couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him By the way if God forbid the deal falls through then forget I wrote all this Have a great weekend Think quality gba

of the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders However all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have

would like to get a copy of these guidelines ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps powdery substances unusual written comments on envelopes etc If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office they will notify us as well as the proper authorities If you have any questions or concerns please see me or Debra Davidson Original Message From Enron NRON On Behalf Of John Brindle Business NRON Sent Wednesday October PM To Enron Employees NRON Subject Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances Most of these have however been determined to be false alarms We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and uptodate guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures If you have additional questions or concerns please contact Corporate Security in Houston at or via email at The most important thing to remember is Do not panic To infect someone the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin swallowed or inhaled as a fine aerosolized mist Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel Remember these are only guidelines Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious It is marked with the word Anthrax It has a nonidentifiable powdery substance on the outside It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated Has no return address or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate Is of unusual weight given its size or is lopsided or oddly shaped Has an unusual amount of tape on it Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as personal or confidential Has a strange odor or stain Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents If you do not have any container then cover the envelope or package with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Leave the room and close the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor Have them call to alert the local police authorities List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for followup investigations and advice If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out Do not try to clean up the powder Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Leave the room and close the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor Have them call to alert the local police authorities Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag or some other container that can be sealed This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling Shower with soap and water as soon as possible Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin If possible list all people who were in the room or area especially those who had actual contact with the powder Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical followup and to law enforcement officials for further investigation

posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices

Richard Steffes James D Subject Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments Forwarded by Sarah NovoselCorpEnron on AM EMILY HARRIS AM To cc Andrea Settanni Subject Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments FERC UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Portland General Electric Company Docket No ER Enron Power Marketing Inc Docket No ER ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Issued July In this order we reject without prejudice proposed amendments of Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI and Portland General Electric PGE to their respective marketbased rate tariffs that would allow them to make interaffiliate sales using the EnronOnline trading platform I Background On May in separate filings affiliates PGE in Docket No ER and EPMI in Docket No ER collectively Applicants filed to amend their respective market based rate schedules to allow for interaffiliate sales through the EnronOnline trading platform and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on EnronOnline This amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of PGEs and EPMIs currently effective tariffs which allow for interaffiliate sales subject to conditions that the Commission generally imposes on interaffiliate sales where there are captive customers eg allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges nonaffiliates requiring simultaneous offers to nonaffiliates or requiring use of a relevant established index Rather PGE and EPMI propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks an Enron Corp subsidiary EnronOnline is a free Internet based transaction system which allows EPMIs customers to view real time prices from EPMIs traders and transact instantly online EnronOnline is not an EPMI application but rather EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in buying from and selling power to third parties Docket Nos ER and ER interaffiliate sales via EnronOnline with restrictions different than those in place but that they state will still prevent affiliate abuse Applicants state that the Commissions requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and in particular the Commissions requirement that PGE post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline since EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the transaction According to Applicants this deprives PGE of the ability to buy or sell power from perhaps the largest marketer in its region to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers II Notice of Filing and InterventionsProtests Notices of the filings were published in the Federal Register Fed Reg Docket No ER and Fed Reg Docket No ER with motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before June None was filed III Discussion The Commission allows power marketers and their public utility affiliates to sell to one another at marketbased rates when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate abuse As the Commission has explained affiliate abuse can occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers sells power at belowmarket prices to or purchases power at abovemarket prices from an affiliate without captive customers such as a power marketer affiliate One way in which the Commission has sought to prevent this type of crosssubsidization by captive customers is to require the pricing of interaffiliate sales at an established relevant market price or index Another way when there is no assurance that the affiliates are transacting at the prevailing market price is to adopt various conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse EPMI Application at PGE Application at EPMI Application at PGE Application at See eg DPL Energy Inc FERC accord First Energy Trading Services Inc FERC at Eg GPU Advanced Resources Inc FERC at continued Docket Nos ER and ER Here Applicants request that the Commission permit them to use EnronOnline to make interaffiliate sales subject to the following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient protection against affiliate abuse PGE when buying from EPMI using EnronOnline will be required to take the transaction price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment In addition PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counterparty is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction being finalized Applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on EnronOnline Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at continued GPU Detroit Edison Company FERC at Detroit Edison In GPU the Commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid nonaffiliates under certain standard supplier agreements Accord First Energy Trading Power Marketing Inc FERC at rehg denied FERC Detroit Edison provided that a traditional public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non affiliates that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board Accord Jersey Central Power Light Co FERC at Commonwealth Edison Co FERC at EPMI Application at PGE Application at In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline EPMI would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available Applications at While Applicants do not define Limit Order the common understanding is that unlike a market order which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met Generally a limit order may be either a day order in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled or gooduntilcanceled in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled Docket Nos ER and ER the posted price a price that is offered to all market participants and there will be no transactions in which EPMI knows that PGE is the counterparty before the transaction is finalized Thus Applicants contend that not only will PGE be unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of PGE In addition because the EnronOnline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants Applicants state that PGEs customers have the opportunity to transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and conditions that are available to PGE Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the Commissions affiliate abuse requirements and conditions eg protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its transactions with its affiliate EPMI The thrust of Applicants argument is that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline a public medium for selling power between affiliates We disagree While perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls faxes or letters an Internetbased platform is just another medium for trade and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied There is for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to buy at For other transactions through media other than EnronOnline including other exchanges EPMI might be See supra notes and accompanying text citing cases that discuss Commissions underlying concerns with affiliate power sales See supra note and accompanying text All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a participant For sales EPMI is the seller For purchases EPMI is the buyer Docket Nos ER and ER willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices Moreover Applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by EPMI are determined or whether there would be any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via EnronOnline or even whether there are other similar but non affiliated Internetbased venues where PGE can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline we now turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE through EnronOnline there is nothing in the Applicants proposed restrictions that would require PGE to simultaneously offer to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate The Commission requires that with respect to any power offered to its affiliate PGE make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board But it is unclear whether PGE can or will make the same offer to nonaffiliates Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited from submitting Limit Orders which would prevent EPMI from knowing that PGE is the counterparty to a transaction Again this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above market prices The Commission is not assured by the Applicants proposal that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commissions expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for interaffiliate power sales transactions There is for example no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers or other interested parties would monitor interaffiliate transactions For the above reasons we will reject the proposed amendments without prejudice to Applicants revising their proposal to address the Commissions concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse Likewise PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices Docket Nos ER and ER The Commission orders Applicants proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected without prejudice as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission S E A L David P Boergers Secretary

<15365862.1075841549655.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tim.belden@enron.com,2002-01-09 08:25:59,RE Dec and Jan liquidations Cc PST Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax who was asked by Don Miller looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December While Id like to be helpful I have never done a cash forecast before We dont have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in Schedule for all of the deals that flowed in December Diana Scholtes sent an email below to Leslie Reeves on January rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didnt want us to update Schedule instead they could work off of our trade sheets I dont care which way we move forward It just seems that we arent all on the same page We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it right the first time I am hoping that between Don Leslie and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do As of now there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection Regards Tim Original Message From Postlethwaite John Sent Tuesday January PM To Reeves Leslie Calger Christopher F White Stacey W Belden Tim Cc Scholtes Diana Semperger Cara Subject Dec and Jan liquidations It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for nonterminated deals should be handled There are conflicting reports that Houston through the estate will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible Thanks John Original Message From Scholtes Diana Sent Thursday January AM To Reeves Leslie Cc Gilbert Scotty Postlethwaite John Belden Tim Subject January Settlements Leslie Im trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January My question is whether we the West desk should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR nondelivery andor incremental deals We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling we can do so I also understand after talking to John you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December Im not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets but if you can call me we can set up a conference call and Ill coordinate from each desk to attend If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know Diana Scholtes West Desk 
<16039729.1075841550746.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tim.belden@enron.com,2001-12-19 16:58:18,New West Power Deal InfoPST Confidential For Internal Distribution Only The purpose of this email is to bring everyone in the loop on activities on the west desk that we are undertaking to preserve as much value in our book as possible I realize that our efforts to date have not been communicated to all internal people who need to know what we are doing My apologies for this Hopefully this email will accomplish that goal A number of counterparties in the west have not yet terminated our deals and have benefited from our inability to procure power in the market to serve these deals As a result we havent been delivering on several contracts that are deep in the money Our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check Instead these counterparties have been happy to not receive high priced power from us and are filling their positions in the market at much lower prices We have taken the limited supplies that we are still receiving and delivering these limited supplies to the highest price sales contracts that we have We now have the ability to prepay for additional supplies in order to fulfill additional prepetition obligations that have not yet been terminated that are in the money We have received approval from the Cash committee for purchases through December th I think and we will secure additional cash to continue on Here are the procedures as I understand them If you have any questions or modifications please me an email or give me a call Cash Desk Each cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated On a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term next day to next week deliveries with that counterparty are in the money If the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point We are of the opinion now that we will not be able to cherry pick deals with one counterparty at the same location The cash desks should prepare a two week view of the positions that we will need to fill and an estimate based on spot market prices of the cash that we will need to serve these transactions to Steve Thome The cash desk should provide a daily list of prepay deals that have been done to John Postlethwaite via email The cahs desk should provide a list of all historic prepays done so far to bring John current Marketing Desk Steve Thome will coordinate the cash approval process for the west desk The marketing desk is responsible for lining up counterparties who will be willing to supply us on a prepay basis The marketing desk should direct any legal questions from sellers to Steve HallChristian Yoder Make sure that sellers fax a copy of the confirmation letter to Steve HallChristian Yoder at The marketing desk needs to work with the cash desk to buy power on a spot basis We dont necessarily care who buys it but rather we want to ensure that we receive the best price and that all purchases are communicated Whoever secures a supply needs to communicate the need for cash to Steve Thome Deal Entry The new deals need to be entered in a manner that will be possible to settle After discussing the matter with Stacey White she recommended entering the new deals in Enpower as zero price non MTM with an annuity equal to the prepay amount We should enter notes into Enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions This will allow settlements to match an annuity in Enpower with prepay out the door It will also prevent them from paying the counterparty twice Im sure that Ive missed something Let me know Regards Tim

the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders However all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have received a hard copy of the guidelines and procedures issued by Oregon Department Administrative Services This fourpage document has detailed guidelines and instructions for mailparcel handling If you would like to get a copy of these guidelines ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps powdery substances unusual written comments on envelopes etc If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office they will notify us as well as the proper authorities If you have any questions or concerns please see me or Debra Davidson Original Message From Enron NRON On Behalf Of John Brindle Business NRON Sent Wednesday October PM To Enron Employees NRON Subject Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances Most of these have however been determined to be false alarms We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and uptodate guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures If you have additional questions or concerns please contact Corporate Security in Houston at or via email at The most important thing to remember is Do not panic To infect someone the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin swallowed or inhaled as a fine aerosolized mist Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel Remember these are only guidelines Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious It is marked with the word Anthrax It has a nonidentifiable powdery substance on the outside It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated Has no return address or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate Is of unusual weight given its size or is lopsided or oddly shaped Has an unusual amount of tape on it Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as personal or confidential Has a strange odor or stain Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents If you do not have any container then cover the envelope or package with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Leave the room and close the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor Have them call to alert the local police authorities List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for followup investigations and advice If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out Do not try to clean up the powder Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything eg clothing paper trash can etc and do not remove this cover Leave the room and close the door or section off the area to prevent others from entering ie keep others away Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor Have them call to alert the local police authorities Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag or some other container that can be sealed This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling Shower with soap and water as soon as possible Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin If possible list all people who were in the room or area especially those who had actual contact with the powder Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical followup and to law enforcement officials for further investigation
