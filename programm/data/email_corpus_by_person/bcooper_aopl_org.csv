the Association of Oil Pipe Lines but they should Congressional Republicans Plan to Push Energy Stalls The expected move by Senate Republicans to offer HR the Housepassed energy bill as an amendment to the Senates version of economic stimulus legislation stalled this week and the stimulus package itself was put off until Congress returns after Thanksgiving It became known that Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS would not support any amendments that would delay the stimulus legislation Bush Administration Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell Daniels offered the opinion that the Senate should develop its own energy bill and dismissed HR as essentially a tax relief bill We still expect negotiations to be concluded on terms for addressing energy legislation in the Senate next February but it is less clear when the agreement will be reached And we still expect the Senate to add the McCain pipeline safety bill to its energy legislation when it does take up the subject thereby bringing the pipeline safety issue before the House in a perhaps more compelling way than heretofore Meanwhile key House Members continue working on pipeline safety legislation but nothing new has been introduced in the form of a bill in the House and no drafts have been released for comment We are urging these House members to put something out around which we can rally With Congress gone for Thanksgiving week we have just have to wait to see if anything like this will happen this year Transportation Appropriations to Move Meanwhile we expect the Transportation Appropriations conference to reconvene soon after Congress returns resolve the Mexican truck issue that has been holding things up and pass a bill that will include significantly increased funding for the Office of

June meeting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intends to take up Colonials request to renew its marketbased rates into the Northeast markets In the mids Colonial was granted marketbased rate status on movements from the Gulf Coast and from Philadelphia and New York City area origins into Philadelphia and New York City area destinations on a temporary basis subject to renewal In March Colonial applied for renewal No one objected but the Commission has not acted on the matter Next week they promise to take it up You can view Colonials application at rims under docket number OR Commission Reaffirms Colonial Abandonment and New Service Ruling At its last meeting the Commission approved an Order on Rehearing of the Commissions October order granting Colonials petition for a declaratory order on abandonment of existing service to Tennessee and the rate structure of new service to Tennessee see FERC Exxon Mobil and Motiva had asked the Commission to reconsider that ruling Colonial is building a new line from Birmingham Alabama to Nashville via Huntsville Tennessee When that line is completed it intends to abandon service to Nashville via a line running from Atlanta Colonial sought a ruling from the Commission that its abandonment of the Atlanta to Nashville line will not be subject to challenge that its indexed rates from Houston origins to Birmingham will not be subject to challenge because of the new connection and that a costofservice may be used to establish the initial rate for the service to Nashville and Huntsville via the new pipeline The Commission approved all of the requests subject to verification at the time that the change takes place Exxon Mobil and Motiva argued that the rules for setting rates as a new service should not apply to this situation because Colonial is really merely providing a new route for an existing service The Commission disagreed finding that rates apply to the specific route and that this was a new route Exxon Mobil and Motiva also argued that Colonial should not be able to rely on indexedgrandfathered rates to Birmingham and to charge costofservice rates for the new pipeline from Birmingham to the Tennessee destinations They argued this was permitting the pipeline to mix and match rate methodologies The Commission disagreed stating that Colonial was merely seeking to add a new service which under the Commissions rules must be justified either with a negotiated rate or on a costofservice basis Finally Exxon Mobil argued that the Commission should look more closely at the abandonment to determine whether the cancellation is in the public interest under section of the Interstate Commerce Act The Commission found that complete abandonment of a service is outside its jurisdiction but allowed Exxon Mobil to argue at the time of the abandonment that a complete abandonment would not take place A copy of the Commissions order may be found at cipsdefaulthtm under docket number OR NTSB Issues Report on Marathon Ashland Spill The National Transportation Safety Board last week issued its accident report on the Marathon Ashland spill in Kentucky last January According to the report that barrel spill resulted from metal fatigue at a dent site The line had been pigged in and an anomaly had been detected there but the pig contractor had determined that the dent was not significant It did not meet repair criteria used at the time The NTSB found failure of the controller and supervisors to timely recognize the rupture shut down the pipeline and isolate the ruptured section of the
