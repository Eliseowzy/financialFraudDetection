some cutoff higher than kWs is appropriate for net metering purposes Where the generator is substantially smaller than the customers offpeak minimum load there does not seem to me to be a need to

Dahlke Michael Early Eric Freedman Steve Larson Doug Nichols Don Watkins Connie Westadt Sent PM Subject RE Initial Email Communication Subgroup Working on GIA LIA Etc Sarah The Generation Interconnection Agreement will have to be modified to accommodate the Net Metering law RCW Chapter that was passed here in Washington in The law covers generators of kW or less that are powered by solar wind hydro or fuel cells Washington distribution utilities are required to install twoway meters for all customers with such facilities and to credit those customers for any power produced in excess of the customers needs We are required to accept all qualified net metering customers until the total generating capacity of the net metered systems reaches percent of our peak load Because these generators are tiny and even in the aggregate are unlikely to have any appreciable effect on the operation of the grid I think the easiest approach would be simply to write an exemption into the GIA for such net metered generators I dont know whether any of the other RTOWest states have net metering laws However net metering has been kicked around quite a bit in connection with federal restructuring legislation Hence we need to keep an eye developments in DC in this regard Eric Christensen Associate General Counsel Snohomish County PUD No Toll free from WA x Office fax Direct fax

Westadt Cc Gary Dahlke Preston Michie Marcus Wood Barney Speckman John Boucher Subject Initial Email Communication Subgroup Working on GIA LIA Etc Good morning everyone I am sorry it has taken me so long to contact you This email is intended to get things rolling for the RTO West Legal Subgroup working on the Generation Integration and Load Integration Agreements as well as Security Coordination and Scheduling Coordinator Agreements if necessary First for your reference I have attached the following documents a list of participants in our subgroup the original IndeGO Generation Integration Agreement GIA and the original IndeGO Load Integration Agreement LIA If you know of anyone who would like to be included in this subgroup that does not appear on the attached participants list please let me know I will also post each of the attached documents on the RTO West website at the link on the Legal Work Group page set up for our subgroup Second I would like to share some initial feedback I have received with respect to our assigned tasks A Concerning the Generation GIA I have the following initial feedback Carl Imparato has expressed strong concern about existing provisions in the GIA designed to address instances when hydro generation facility operators are forced to move water through turbines rather than spill it to avoid dissolved gas supersaturation problems James Mosher has expressed concern that the GIA as currently drafted does not adequately address issues unique to Qualifying Facilities and would like us to work on that and Steve Larson of BPA has contacted me to let me know that BPA has developed some initial comments on the GIA and LIA but I have not yet had a chance to have a conversation with BPA representatives about what those comments are I hope to do that sometime tomorrow Thursday June if possible B I have talked with John Boucher who leads the Implementation Work Group and he says that the initial consensus within the Implementation Work Group is that we should begin with the approach that security coordination for RTO West will be accomplished through the existing organization set up in the Northwest to perform security coordination Pacific Northwest Security Coordinator or PNSC which is a Washington nonprofit corporation and C John Boucher says that the initial thinking in the Implementation Work Group about scheduling coordinators as that we should assume that we will have scheduling coordinators for RTO West and therefore will need to develop a scheduling coordinator agreement With that in mind I have also attached to this email an email message from Barney Speckman on this topic Barneys email describes input he has received from Carl Imparato concerning areas in the West that have already developed scheduling coordinator agreements and includes an email from Carl with sample documents I will also post these on the RTO West website as soon as possible along with the basic form of Security Coordination Agreement developed for PNSC I think it might be useful to plan to meet or have a telephone conference call during the week of July early in the week if possible to discuss our various tasks and strategies for accomplishing them If most of you are going to be at the Legal Work Group meeting on June that might be a good opportunity to try to identify a time and date that works for most subgroup members and to decide whether to meet in person or by telephone conference I also hope to make initial cosmetic changes to the GIA and LIA very soon and will put the initial revised versions of those documents on the website as soon as they are ready In the meantime if anyone else has some input they would like to offer with respect to the issues and documents assigned to our subgroup you are welcome to

metering law as well although the cutoff is probably less than MW I think that a net metering provision would be appropriate for a number of reasons not all of which are compelled by state renewable lawspolicies Many small wholesale entities at least in Utah and other eastside locations have modest generators behind their meters and would be disadvantaged if there were no net metering accommodations avilable Given the size of the generators generally much less than MW they are not significant to the grid but are to their owners Original Message From Christensen Eric To Sarah
