Subject THE LIGHTHOUSE December THE LIGHTHOUSE Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy Vol Issue December IN THIS WEEKS ISSUE Defunct Stimulus Package Is Uncle Sams Unintended Gift Ode to John Ashcroft

organization If you know someone who would enjoy THE LIGHTHOUSE please forward this issue If they like it they can add themselves to the list at tiilighthouseLighthousehtml DEFUNCT STIMULUS PACKAGE IS UNCLE SAMS UNINTENDED GIFT Uncle Sam sent taxpayers an unexpected gift last week an economic stimulus package that never made it off Capitol Hill Many economists critical of the proposed government spending increases have pointed out that the economy had already started to show signs of recovery anyway Other critics correctly point out that the stimulus had enough pork to keep specialinterest groups hibernating high on the hog till next winter There is however another reason to have frowned at Washingtons stimulus proposals and to rejoice at their demise Government stimulus packages are not as environmentalists might say sustainable They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private investment the fuel of economic recovery And when a government stimulus is financed by inflation it tends to undermine the source of that fuel capital formation This holiday season we can thank Congress for its inability to agree to help the economy But unfortunately were still haunted with visions of Christmas past when bad legislation has gone back to conference committees only to be return as even worse legislation Too bad Washington DC doesnt have a no returns policy For more on the

Twight THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW Fall tiicontentpubsreviewtirtwighthtml A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION Christmas a holiday rooted in both Christianity and preChristian celebrations of the winter solstice is also an appropriate time to reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization over the course of two tumultuous millennia Among these values freedom of conscience peace on Earth and goodwill toward men These values transcend any particular religion they are in fact articulated in varying degrees by most of the worlds religions Yet they have found their fullest expression in the West Why Because in Western culture more than in any other the individual counts This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western civilization writes Paul Craig Roberts And it is this individualist precept respect for the dignity and worth of each human life that holds the key to understanding the unique institutions of the West The Wests individualism writes Roberts permits an individual person to put his or her foot down to take a stand on principle to become a reformer and take on injustice It has made the individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens protected from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the progressive forces of what one economist termed creative destruction so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas This perhaps is the Wests supreme paradox and achievement its tradition of questioning even tradition itself Concludes Roberts Be we religious or be we not our celebration of Christs birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our souls and of our political life on Earth Such a religion as this is worth holding onto even by atheists See The Greatest Gift by Paul Craig Roberts at tiilighthouseLHLinkhtml Also see The Drama of Western Identity by David Gress THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW Winter
