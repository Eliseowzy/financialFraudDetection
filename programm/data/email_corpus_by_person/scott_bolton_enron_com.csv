Jones Enron Corp ENE is currently testing hardware and software in order to start trading telecommunications bandwidth capacity early next month The installations in New York City and Los Angeles are key steps in a pioneering proposal that could create a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year Tom Gros Enron Communications vice president of global bandwidth trading told Dow Jones Newswires Enron has proposed trading Time Division Multiplexing or TDM and Internet Protocol or IP bandwidth TDM is used mostly for voice transmission and IP is used mostly for data transmission In nontechnical terms TDM and IP have been compared to two different systems for moving commuters TDM is comparable to a rail system moving commuters by train with only one train at a time moving on the track between two points IP is comparable to commuters moving in smaller groups in several cars between the same two points The route between those two points can be used by other commuters or other data at the same time In other words TDM sends one signal at a time between two points IP breaks a single transmission of data into packets of data moves them to another point where they are reassembled into one message With IP packets of many separate data transmissions can be sent simultaneously over a path Trading of TDM bandwidth will start in December and trading of IP will start early next year Gros said Trading will begin with TDM because its a more liquid market Three types of TDM bandwidth will trade DS OC and OC DS moves about million bits per second OC moves Mbps and OC moves Mbps Enrons proposal would establish a master agreement covering quality specifications and the delivery mechanism for trading bandwidth as a commodity After companies sign that agreement all their trades would be covered by it Individual deals could then be negotiated over the phone to cover price time period segment and quantity in a few minutes Gros said The standard terms and conditions Enron has come up with should make deals happen more quickly said Amanda McCarthy an analyst for Forrester Research a technology research company Each deals contract would be confirmed the same day by facsimile or electronic communication between the buyer and seller They would be unregulated overthecounter transactions If a company fails to make or take delivery according to the deal specifications it would be subject to liquidated damages By installing the hardware and software needed for trading Enron will become the first pooling point developer called for in its proposal The hardware and software will establish connections with other carriers enabling trades of TDM bandwidth capacity between New York and Los Angeles The path between New York and Los Angeles is the most liquid in North America Gros said Its also an excellent launching point to connect with European and Asian markets Because that path is volatile it will motivate industry players to mitigate price risk and will give speculators trading opportunities according to Enrons proposal Developers will build up to other pooling points in North American cities in the next months Gros said Those pooling points will allow bandwidth between other pairs of cities to trade under the standard terms and conditions As many as more pooling points will be built outside of North America particularly in Western Europe and the Pacific Rim creating a global market for bandwidth he said Enron Chairman Ken Lay said recently that bandwidth would be trading under Enrons proposal in Europe by the first half of next year and in Asia by the second half of next year Enron is willing to build all the pooling points at a cost of a few million dollars each Gros said But other companies also are interested in being pooling point developers Once we build the first two and prove the concept were looking forward to pretty healthy competition for people who want to be pooling point developers Having Enron own any of the pooling points is a problem said Forresters McCarthy Enron is not a disinterested party It has its own network and it owns hubs so a company like ATT wont fully participate in that market The idea of a neutral third party is important she said Gros said Enron has addressed that potential problem with the concept of a pooling point administrator or PPA The PPA a neutral third party would help to arrange physical delivery of the bandwidth The PPA and both parties to the trade would monitor quality of service and other terms of the deal as it runs its course Enron is talking to PricewaterhouseCoopers about being the pooling point administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers already has been working with Enron for months to develop the role of the pooling point administrator Pooling point developers will have to build to meet specifications of the bandwidth trading organization or BTO Gros said The bandwidth trading organization will be made up of traders in industry and will be authorized to approve pooling point developers and the pooling point administrator We hope thatby the end of the first quarter of we will have the founding members of the trading organization Gros said Thats not a firm date but a reasonable time frame The BTO wasnt part of the original trading proposal Enron released in May It was added recently to help allay any fears about Enron or any other company developing and owning pooling points Some skeptics doubt there will be a rush to sign up for the BTO or to accept Enrons proposal for trading They cite what they call a poor turnout at Enrons industry summit in September in California Gros wouldnt name specific companies that attended the meeting He said only that it was attended by telecommunications carrier firms that have significant physical capacity in the Pacific Atlantic and North American segments There were also hardware firms and a couple of consulting firms represented An attendee who didnt want to be identified said only two carriers attended Global Crossing Ltd and Williams Communications Group They were having a tough time with the proposal he said Gros said Enron had the turnout it expected Attendance was limited purposely so the meeting would be a roundtable discussion We turned away dozens who had asked to come Gros said He isnt bothered by skeptics Enron encountered skeptics when US natural gas and electric power markets were commoditized in the last two decades he said The company worked to establish both of those markets and now it is the largest player in each of them It also plans to be a firstmover in the bandwidth market When trading starts in December Enron will be a marketmaker buying or selling as needed to get the market moving Gros said And he wont be discouraged if the market doesnt grow quickly The commodity market for gas and power each took off slowly he said Instead he continues to promote the benefits of a bandwidth commodity market Even if you dont own any physical capacity it will be so easy for you ina couple of phone calls to effectively nail up a national or possibly international telecommunications grid If the market develops as Enron has predicted it could prevent major headaches for telecommunications carriers and their customers When Uunet a unit of MCI Worldcom Inc WCOM had a system problem recently the Chicago Board of Trade one of its customers lost its online trading system for a few days If bandwidth had been trading as a commodity when MCI had its problems last month it would have given the company a range of choices to solve the problem said Forresters McCarthy Gros agreed A realtime market in bandwidth could develop If that market had existed when Uunet had its problem the CBOT would have been able to get its online trading system back up in a matter of minutes or hours he said By Michael Rieke Dow Jones Newswires 
<28136573.1075842935353.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scott.bolton@enron.com,1999-11-11 01:33:00,Info Update storiesMAX SMETANNIKOV InterActive Week Idea is to build on streaming content delivery While Akamai Technologies and recently acquired Sandpiper Networks have captured the majority of mind share as leaders in the emerging content distribution market Enron Communications is making a bid to blend together its assets as a national carrier to beat back the startups and make some major waves in the content delivery business Last week Portland Orebased carrier Enron wwwenronnet announced it has broadened its content distribution network to focus on streaming media The intensified pursuit of the content distribution space is likely to come as a surprise to competitors that perceive the carrier as more of a bandwidth wholesaler However company executives say content distribution ofvarious kinds is what Enron is all about What we do is exactly what they Akamai do says Joe Hirko Enron president and chief executive The difference is that their services are acceptable for some content that isnt missioncntical and we have that same model and we do that for missioncrincal content Just like Akamai and Sandpiper Enron is colocating its media distribution servers with other Internet service providers ISPs members of the socalled ePowered Distribution Program making it possible for Enron to reserve bandwidth on partners networks The differentiator that Enron brings to the table is its qualityofservice guarantee backed by an elaborate network architecture and business model that Enron is building which relies on a combination of alliances and a bandwidth broker exchange First Enron has built its own content distribution network with servers colocated with other ISPs These carriers include Epoch Internet Electric Lightwave FlashNet Communications GTE Intenetworking InterNap NetRail NorthPoint Communications RCN and Veno Enron is also pursuing satellite providers as another group of carriers capable of distributing content in geographically remote places where fiber networks are not present yet While traditional content distributors measure their footprint in servers distributed with other hackhones Enron uses its points of presence and the number ofdesktops reached as its basic metrics Enron says it can shoot audio and video streams to million desktops via POPs Second Enron is in the final stages of establishing its own bandwidth exchange a division that would trade space on other carriers networks as a way to provision bandwidth on demand Hirko says six interconnection points for carriers that want to trade on this exchange have been built and the first trades will start before the end of the year This would be the first time a bandwidth exchange business model in itself a nascent idea would be married to content distribution as the means to bring down the cost of streaming media distribution This is something completely new I have not seen anything like this says Tim Strong an analyst at consultancy TeleGeography in Washington DC The result is essentially complete control over the pipe delivering voice and video a position of power that Hirko says will lead to unmatched performance We are talking frames a second Hirko says adding that it is not uncommon to tap into streaming video feeds as low as two or three frames per second Enron plans to charge its users less than cents per megabyte delivered Akamai wwwakamaicom which doesnt own its own network and uses the Internet as the means of streaming media delivery also plans to guarantee nearzero packet loss with its patentpending yettobelaunched service called Steady Stream The biggest challenge for Enron is to convince potential customers that the carrier is more than simply a bandwidth provider To date Enrons only public streaming media client is CountryCoolcom Enron officials see an opportunity to barge into the industry by commandeering the unconquered segment of the content distribution market streaming media where Akamai and Sandpiper have yet to make a name We are using Akamai for distribution of objects and static images says Monty Mullig vice president of CNN Internet Technologies Its possible Akamai might work for streaming media but I have not seen that product from them yet CNN Interactive is distributing most of its video through Intervu one of the first providers of streaming media services While Mullig is intrigued by the prospects of Enrons bandwidth exchange services he has yet to be convinced the company offers a compeffing service They havent put a product in front of us that we would be interested in Mullig says We want a big audience behind the service that we buy like Akamais On its face value Enrons network is not any more interesting than networks of other players their size The master plan National carrier Enron cites four building blocks as the foundation for its content distribution service

and voice mail messaged to you language that would have barred internet companies from obtaining the licenses to transmit movies sporting events and other broadcast programs was DROPPED from HR the satellite TV bill which is attached to HR the omnibus appropriations legislation Please see the CQ article below for more information on the legislation in general We will certainly continue to watch for language like this that might surface in future legislation In the context of ECIs larger legislative agenda we may also want to explore the potential to develop legislation that would proactively ensure the broadcast of licensed programming over the internet Cheers Jeff TELECOMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE BILL SURVIVES A SCARE CARRIES OTHER MEASURES WITH IT By Alan K Ota CQ Staff Writer Nov The uproar in the Senate Thursday over deletion of a loan guarantee program designed to improve rural television service nearly obscured the significance of the satellite television bill that was linked to the fiscal omnibus spending bill HR The controversial provision would have created a new Agriculture Department program to guarantee billion in loans enabling satellite providers to transmit local programming to rural subscribers service they insist is too expensive to provide without help It was added to the satellite TV bill HR in conference but dropped when the final version S was referenced in HR Ruralstate senators led by Max Baucus RMont blocked action on a stopgap funding bill HJRES until leaders promised them a floor vote on the loan guarantee legislation or similar provisions by next April Also dropped from the final bill was language that would haved barred Internet service providers from obtaining the licenses necessary to transmit movies sports events and other broadcast programming Cable and satellite providers would be the only entities with such licenses America Online and other companies lobbied furiously to strip the provision The final measure would for the first time allow satellite companies to beam local news sports weather and other broadcast programming to all of their customers just as cable providers do And it would grant a reprieve to more than a million satellite subscribers now receiving local channels who otherwise would lose those signals by years end A court had ruled the subscribers do not qualify to receive local signals by satellite under current law Satellite companies would have to gain permission from local broadcast stations within six months after they begin retransmitting those signals By Jan satellite carriers that transmit local channels would have to carry all of the channels in that community a mustcarry requirement already imposed on cable providers The measure would extend for five years the licenses under which satellite companies retransmit the signals of superstations and distant network stations and reduce the copyright fees they must pay The bill would generally retain existing standards for

are unable to receive acceptablequality broadcast signals over the air Like the conference report on HR the final satellite bill carries a number of pieces of unrelated legislation Patent Overhaul In a victory for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G Hatch RUtah negotiators included a patent system overhaul bill HR that was strongly opposed by some inventors and by the Eagle Forum a conservative group headed by political activist Phyllis Schlafly who argued that it would permit foreign companies to steal American technology The bill would require publication of some patent applications which have been filed both in the United States and abroad within months of filing whether or not patents have been granted The measure also would require the Patent and Trademark Office to approve or reject a patent application within three years It would provide patent term extensions for any not approved within that threeyear period to guarantee investors a year patent term Currently patents are for years but inventors often lose years waiting for approval of their applications LowPower TV Stations The omnibus spending bill also included provisions of a bill HR to create a new Class A license for lowpower television stations equivalent to those granted to fullservice primary stations The provisions are designed to help lowpower stations that often provide niche programming in urban areas and local programming in rural areas become more stable and commercially viable Cybersquatting The measure includes provisions of a bill S to bar unauthorized use of trademarkprotected brand names in Internet addresses The bill was passed by the Senate by voice vote Aug the House passed a different version Oct PBS Donor Lists In response to disclosures earlier this year that some public broadcast stations had exchanged donor lists with political parties and primarily with Democratic Party units negotiators included a provision to prohibit such stations from sharing their donor lists with political parties It also would bar disclosure of its donors to any nonaffiliated group without the donors consent Rep Cliff Stearns RFla had introduced legislation HR

York City whe n the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce held its last meeting midSeptember Sensing impending travel catastrophes coupled with a mass exodus down the shoreline to Washington after the sessions adjournment th e group appeased a eleventhhour call from Utah Gov Michael Leavitt R to request proposals from the public on how to best deal with the prospect of taxing ecommerce And this week after around proposals were submitted to the commission a different kind of storm began to brew Consumer advocacy groups local government organizations and commissionwatchers unleashed a flurry of press releases and media events t o announce their proposals which were due to the commission on Nov Many of the submissions which were called to meet a set of criteria ranging from meeting constitutional muster to radically simplifying the sales ta x system responded to Leavitts plan Also due on that date were comments t o be considered for the reportdrafting subcommittees issues and options paper which will serve as a compilation of ideas on the topic of electroni c commerce and taxation for the entire commission to consider while it drafts its final recommendation What I think were seeing is a tremendously positive development sa id Jim Lucier a Prudential analyst who worked with Americans for Tax Reforms Grover Norquist as he lobbied while the legislation creating the commission was being drafted Instead of constantly squabbling you have important groups within the commission working hard to get majority positions Because infighting has plagued the commission from its beginning a majority may be the most difficult endeavor many of these groups have worke d for The member commission needs a twothirds majority vote to approve a ny recommendation and the group already has shifted into pro and antitax factions with only a few still undecided The proposals are making their rounds among the commissionmembers and the next meeting is Dec While there are a host of groups that have submitted their propositions it appear s that three are getting the majority of the commissions attention and one specifically because it was drafted by the groups chairman Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore Following is a synopses and analysis of the three plans that have the best chance of succeeding Title Streamlined Sales Tax System for the st Century ZeroBurden Pl an Sponsor National Governors Association National Conference of State Legislatures National Association of Counties US Conference of Mayors Council of State Governments International City County Management Association While the remaining member of the Big Seven local organizations the National League of Cities has backed the proposals intent it is waiting until its annual meeting in December to vote on supporting it officially Description The idea centers around establishing a trusted third party or tax clearinghouse to collect and remit sales taxes based on the purchaser s tax jurisdiction When an online order is placed the seller would notify t he clearinghouse and credit card company to determine the jurisdiction of the buyer The third party would notify the seller of the appropriate tax amoun t the credit card company would collect the funds and then remit the tax to t he clearinghouse The clearinghouse would then distribute the funds to the states and localities and would be paid by a percentage of what it collects The third parties would be licensed by the state and the necessary software required of each vendor would be paid for by the state History The plan was drafted after a series of marathon meetings by the local organizations that argue they are jeopardized because of lost sales t ax revenues from ecommerce Organizers of the proposal which is being touted by Gov Leavitt say that regardless of the commissions final decision the y will begin pushing the system to state legislatures for adoption Under the Internet Tax Freedom Act no new taxes may be applied to ecommerce but existing taxes such as sales and use taxes are not covered The sponsors say they do not need the commissions goahead in order to implement the system which would be optional by state and would not require all state s involvement to function Comments The plan is widely criticized by antita x advocates and those who believe that taxing ecommerce will stifle its growth Others say that the protax movement is only supported by the national government organizations and not their members with Leavitt being the notable exception and criticize it for not receiving many other individuals support But the organizations argue that unless states and localities have the right to determine revenueraising activities control of local services like education and law enforcement ultimately will be given to the federal government Thomas Jefferson would roll over in his grave if that happens Leavitt said Title EFreedom Coalition Proposal Sponsors The EFreedom Coalitions membership involves over organizations including Americans for Tax Reform Citizens Against Government Waste Competitive Enterprise Institute Consumer Alert Heritag e Foundation Progress and Freedom Foundation and State Policy Network Description The group supports a ban on collection of sales taxes on electronic commerce and the repeal of the percent federal excise tax on telecommunications It also would ban discriminatory Internet taxation and taxes on Internet access The group endorses slashing local telecommunications taxes and wants to see interstate telecom property taxes reduced and controlled with federal protections History The EFreedom Coalition unveiled its proposal at a joint press conference with legislatio n by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich ROH that would ban Intern et sales taxes Kasichs Internet Tax Elimination Act HR would make permanent the threeyear moratorium on discriminatory Internet taxes passed in the Internet Tax Freedom Act Fellow Ohio Republican John Boehner joined Kasich in sponsoring the measure Comments Americans for Tax Reforms Norquist has led the antitax movement on the commission Stan Sokul an independent consultant for the Association for Interactive Media was also o n hand to support the proposal Advocates are promoting the plan by saying it would protect consumers privacy by not collecting personal information fro m users to determine tax jurisdictions Title No Internet Tax Sponsor Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore R chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce Description Gilmores proposal is almost identical in ideology to the EFreedom Coalition plan He maintains Congress should ban all sales and use taxes on ecommerce and protect businesses from state income and business activity taxes simply because of their virtual presence in a state Gilmore also has proposed the elimination of the percent federal excise tax on telecommunications and has called for the federal government to give states billion each year for the lost revenue from the repeal of sales taxes on ecommerce transactions He also has proposed that states be allowed to use federal welfare money to purchase computers a nd Internet access for needy families History Gilmores outline was submitted to the policies and options paper that the commission is preparing not under the call for proposals suggeste d by Leavitt But because he is the chair of the commission and had maintaine d that he would remain neutral Gilmores actions have received criticism fro m many on the state and local side of the debate But he has defended his actions After hearing dozens of experts on an entire range of ecommerce issues I felt it was time to put forward my vision It can be summarized i n three words No Internet Tax Gilmore said in a recent speech Observers have speculated that Gilmores plan could be meshed with the EFreedom Coalitions to come up with a proposal agreeable to both parties And suggestions such as the welfare provision even have appeased protax groups which have said solutions such as those may be the most agreeable for a consensus statement Comments The National Association of Counties and oth er local groups remain opposed to the plans provisions calling for the federa l government to allot funds to localities The fact remains that Gilmores proposal means county officials will be even more dependent on state and federal governments to fund their local services said NACos Executive Director Larry Naake This isnt my idea of returning more control and authority to the local citizen by Stephanie Lash

Services Modernization Act was signe d into law some state regulators could see signs of trouble Unsure that the bill would provide adequate privacy protections for financial records stat es began hashing out the issue investigating consumer privacy and launching committees dedicated to exploring options Those efforts have proven fruitful With privacy advocates lamenting the final results in S the pressure is seeping into the states to protect personal information Howeve r there are precious few that foreshadowed the federal governments game of catch to the states on the issue of privacy Now privacy advocates are bombarding state capitals urging them to take action that the federal government didnt What didnt happen at the federal level was an optin policy for shari ng of consumer information The legislation which provided a legal framework for financial services megamergers permits banks to share their customers information with other businesses such as brokerages insurance firms and telemarketers To reveal customers personallyidentifiable information wit h outside partners the financial institutions must provide consumers the opportunity to optout of the sharing arrangement This means that bank customers would need to notify a bank that they are against the disclosure of their personal information if they dont alert the bank their information would automatically be up for grabs An amendment introduced by Sen Paul Sarbanes DMD secures the right of states to pass stricter informationsharing regulations While privacy advocates are satiated by th e provision they would have preferred language that required consumers to optin to all informationsharing practices Now they hope to see that typ e of policy enacted in the states Building A Framework There are a handful of states that already had begun work in the priva cy arena One is Minnesota which catapulted itself into the national privacy spotlight in June when Attorney General Mike Hatch launched an investigatio n and lawsuit against US Bank for giving out personal financial information to a telemarketing company The telemarketers after calling customers and inquiring whether they wanted additional information about bank services charged the customers for the services Hatch alleged that the bank release d the information for million plus commissions some of which he said were gained by disclosing deceptive information Under the settlement the bank donated over million to charities around the state and agreed to make refunds to Minnesota customers who were victims of the scheme It also enacted an optout policy among other penalties Minnesota was one of the most outspoken opponents of the federal legislation saying that it was ev en weaker than the settlement we got according to Hatchs press secretary Leslie Sandburg Consumers Unions David Butler called Minnesota as proactive as any state at this point for their prosecution of US Bank but added that th is is still a relatively new debate at the state level Some observers anticipate that with the passage of the federal bank bill states may become more alert to the issues at hand This will force states to look directly at the issue said Brett Hester the National Governors Associations economic development policy analyst John Ryan of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors agreed Its a hot issue an easily political issue he said You have elected officials who may want to make an issue out of this Minnesota taking advantage of the Sarbanes amendment will introduce legislation next session to the tune of protectin g consumer privacy Also at the fore is Massachusetts Lieutenant Gov Jane Swift R and Gov Paul Cellucci In a recent speech Swift railed against the federal legislation saying that both Congress and the administration missed out on a historic opportunity to ensure privacy protections Now that the federal government has determined that states should decide some privacy issues for their citizens Swift said we in Massachusetts are pleased to be at the forefront of this crucial national debate At the crux of the administrations plan is the establishment of an optin system that require s businesses to seek consumers consent before they sell or share information Governor Cellucci and I dont think that this is too much to ask she added The legislations initiative grew out of a qualityoflife commission established by the governor The group determined that privacy was one of t he hottest issues and from that grew the omnibus legislation that has been se nt to five different legislative hearings and two public hearings explained John Ziemba deputy general counsel and deputy director of the Office of Consumer Affairs Most committees are still looking at the legislation and will wrapup their investigations next year as the Massachusetts legislatu re completes its twoyear term While Massachusetts remains one of the few states specifically targeti ng financial privacy a host of others are joining the bandwagon in the hopes of ensuring consumer protection in other hightech areas New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer joined the group of state attorneys general upset wit h the weak protections in the federal bank bill but it wasnt the first time he had entered the arena He had ushered through a spam bill allowing consumers the right to optout of receiving unsolicited bulk email a nd a bill that would prohibit Web site owners from tracking consumer information unless users consented to the actions said spokeswoman Christine Pritchard Now the focus has turned to reforming the Fair Credit Reporting Act which among other things would provide consumers the right to receive one free credit report each year to determine its accuracy And Spitzer also has promoted a bill on identity theft declaring that if a consumers identity has been stolen to obtain anything of value the customer and not just the credit card company is deemed a victim and can seek reimbursement Honing In On The Hot Topics Identity theft perhaps because of the personal stories that result fr om it is one of the hotter privacy issues in the states and Arizona is worki ng on a law making it a crime to steal a personal password Rep Jeff HatchMiller R who chairs the states Internet study commission said tha t legislators are just beginning to understand the new level of concern being raised by citizens with respect to their right to privacy The group has established a subcommittee looking into additional privacy legislation that may be needed with the understanding that the rules must seek a balance between protecting consumers and businesses alike Arizona is a fairly conservative state HatchMiller said Were friendly to business here To the extent possible I think well promote private solutions as we do prefer them to government solutions HatchMiller added that one of the newest areas of concern is information from customer convenience cards such as those given out by grocery stores to determine sale prices being sold to outside marketers California already has seen legislation introduced that would bar the sale of that information and its legislatures Joint Task Force on Personal Information and Privacy continues to look at that as well as all issues surrounding privacy Sen Jackie Speier DSan FranciscoSan Mateo is expected to soon drop a bill complementing the Financial Services Modernization Act that would prohibit the sharing of personal information among affiliate companies in different sectors Although because of the strong banking lobby and the political difficulties surrounding the issue staffers say they still dont know what form the bill will take That seems to be a familiar refrain in such discussions as many elect ed officials grapple with the growing number of privacy concerns that technological advances have ushered in Many legislators looking to the federal government for guidance on the matter have been thrown an unexpecte d duty with the results in the financial services act but observers say they will take the ball and run with it I think what will happen is youll see legislation in areas where there may

entertainment behemoth Time Warner will do little to cool the ongoing fight over how to regulate new highspeed Internet services industry watchers sa id Monday It is unclear how or whether AOL would allow competing Internet servic e providers access to its proposed cable network said industry analyst Bill Whyman of the merger currently valued at billion AOL has fought aggressively over the past year in Congress the Federal Communications Commission and with local governments to force ATT to open its highspeed cable network to competitors Its one of the monster issues said Whyman who is a principal at Legg Masons Precursor Group AOL CEO Steve Case said theyre committed to consumer choice What we dont know is whether other ISPs besides AOL will have nondiscriminatory access to Time Warner networks Whyman said the merger will likely turn the Internet into a video vehicle quicker than initially expected which will ultimately put pressure on telephone companies to speed up their deployment of high speed digital subscriber lines DSL Barbara Dooley executive director of the Commercial Internet eXchange Association said the merger proves that the marketplace is working and th at its too early to determine which way broadband will grow She added that smaller ISPs are still in a position to make deals with other broadband providers There will be other alternatives to cable she said An ISP in a particular area will not have to offer all options On the cable side ATT a frequent sparring partner with AOL over broadband issues said the merger reconfirms the importance of cable broadband The proposed deal underscores the significance of broadband distribution and it reconfirms the value of ATTs considerable broadband assets a spokeswoman said And National Cable Television Association President and CEO Robert Sac hs boasted in a statement that the deal proves that cable is the future of highspeed Internet service and that regulators have been wise to stay out of the broadband fight to date The Baby Bells remained adamant in their argument that they need regulatory relief to compete with the new mega companies like ATT and now AOL This new megacompany would be providing cable Internet and telephon y virtually regulation free said David Bolger spokesman for the United States Telecom Association which represents the Bells We have the shackl es and they dont The merger must pass muster with the Justice Department and the Federa l Communications Commission The FCC had no comment on the AOLTime Warner announcement by Rebecca S Weiner AntitrustAntitrust Anticipation Follows Merger Announcement Opponents of the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner raised antitrust concerns Monday about the monopolization of the market for highspeed Internet access and consolidation of content on the Web But proponents of the merger said the announcement underscored the marketplace abilitys to resolve competitive concerns and noted a combi ned AOLTime Warner would present a potent new competitor to Microsoft and to ATT Consumers do not want to be beholden to a giant mediaInternet dictatorship even if it promises to be a benevolent one said Andy Schwartzman president of the Media Access Project which issued a joint statement with Consumers Union the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Media Education expressing strong reservations about what would be the biggest corporate merger in US history The groups are calling for the Federal Communications Commission to require cable and other highspeed Internet access providers to open their networks to competitors and asking that ATTs ownership interests in Time Warner are severed But others dismissed those arguments noting that over the past two years we have this phenomenon whereby a new merger or technology is announced and some company is immediately put forward as the media giant said James Gattuso vice president for policy and management at the Competitive Enterprise Institute citing a string of prognostications about SBC BellAtlantic Microsoft ATT and now AOLTime Warner If consummated the merger is also likely to benefit Microsofts de fense against the Department of Justices antitrust lawsuit said William Kova cic an antitrust law expert at George Washington University Law School The fa ct that the industry environment is extremely turbulent and unpredictable and can change the position of companies in a real hurry makes it hard to prescribe remedies that wont go into affect for twoandahalf years A spokesman for Microsoft said the company had no comment on the merge r Kovacic also said he anticipated a freeforall among regulatory agencies seeking jurisdiction to review the proposed merger including the Department of Justice the Federal Trade Commission the FCC state attorne ys general municipalities public service regulatory bodies and foreign governments The mergers critics are particularly concerned that AOL will re verse its longstanding argument to force broadband networks open I think AOL CEO Steve Case is the Benedict Arnold of the digital age said Jeff Chester executive director of the Center for Media Education To me what I heard today was a reversal of their public position said Chester by Drew Clark On The Hill Lawmaker Calls For Antitrust Hearings Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Mike DeWine ROH sa id Monday that the Judiciary Committee intends to hold hearings to scrutinize the proposed America OnlineTime Warner merger It seems that this deal could make sense for consumers by creating an organization that will deliver news and information more efficiently across the videobroadband spectrum DeWine said in a statement However whenever a dominant Internet company merges with a leading media conglomerate it raises a whole host of competition and public policy issues DeWine said One concern in particular is the impact this may hav e on the socalled marketplace of ideas We need to examine the many implications of this deal This merger also adds a new wrinkle to the broadband openaccess debate by potentially resolving it through private negotiation rather than by government regulation DeWine concluded In a statement released Monday Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy DVT expressed more skepticism We will have to loo k closely at whether it makes public policy sense to consolidate control of content cable and Internet service distribution channels he said At so me point all of this concentration and convergence has implications for consumers because it will minimize competition and choice giving us fewer voices and fewer pipelines in the marketplace Although Leahy said this merger between one of the largest owners of content with the largest provider of Internet services may have been inevitable he added an element of caution is only prudent given the sco pe and impact of this planned merger The great promise of the Internet has been to allow people a wide ran ge of information sources and choices said Leahy What we should do is make sure that all that information does not become funneled and controlled by just two or three sources A spokesman for Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain RAZ said he had no comment about the proposed merger

Bandwidth Trading Description Is Latest Fiber Optic Play Enron Detail Dow Jones News Service Investors cant get enough fiber And were not talking about a bowl of Cheerios or Special K Were talking about fiber optics Telecommunications companies such as Qwest Communications QWST Global Crossing GBLX and Level Communications LVLT are racing to build new fiberoptic networks so that highbandwidth applications like video can travel faster and be clearer when they reach the desktop The huge growth of the Internet has increased the need for more capacity on old fiber and copper wire networks All sorts of new switches routers servers and software are being used to build the new networks and beef up the old ones The need for fiber and gadgets that enhance networks prompted Corning GLW that erstwhile dishmaker to announce Thursday that it will spend million to increase its fiberoptics manufacturing capacity by over the next few years And the trend has sent stocks like JDS Uniphase JDSU SDL SDLI and Sycamore Networks SCMR through the roof The excitement over fiber optics and increasing bandwidth is also juicing up shares of an old natural gas and electric company called Enron ENE True Enron isnt a typical energy or utility company The Houstonbased company is known for leading the charge of wholesale marketing and trading of gas and electricity But Enron has never been considered a telecommunications company Until now After trading between and last year Enron shares shot up to a new high of last month after the company held its annual analysts conference where it unveiled its new communications strategy and a surprising joint venture with Sun Microsystems SUNW Wall Street was smitten Although this is still an energy company in our view Enron fits the description of a new economy stock because it has moved its wholesale trading operations online and announced a unique broadband strategy wrote Donato Eassey a Wall Street Journal AllStar analyst at Merrill Lynch Enron has been building its broadband business since when it acquired Portland General Electric which started building a fiberoptic network Enron invited both telecom analysts and the usual contingent of natural gas analysts to its Jan meeting The company presented its new network which is based on fiber servers that are ramps on and off the network pooling points which are essentially switches that connect its network to other networks and software to control the transmission of data The company is using networking gear mostly from Lucent Technology LU and Cisco Systems CSCO By the end of Enron expects to increase its network to miles from about miles now a sizeable slice of the roughly miles of fiber in the US The company also announced a joint venture with Sun Microsystems to develop a standard technology for accessing realtime bandwidth and supply Enron with servers With Sun CEO Scott McNealy at their side Enron executives said Sun will purchase broadband video streaming services from Enron All we can say is WOW wrote Edward Tirello Jr at Deutsche Bank Alex Brown in a note after the show Just when we began to ponder the potential with a very healthy skepticism Enron brilliantly anticipated the reaction and thrust Sun Microsystems billionaire CEO Scott McNealy into the mix Fund managers have been intrigued by Enrons transformation too Back in December the Janus Fund JANSX snapped up million shares of Enron bringing its stake to more than million shares and making it by far the largest holder of the stock according to the latest monthly data from Morningstar And Fidelitys huge Magellan FMAGX fund nearly doubled its stake in Enron to million shares in December Says Marion Schultheis managing director at J W Seligman who owns the stock in two growth funds and is looking to buy more Now there are real tech people looking at Enron Analysts think Enrons stock can climb even higher In January it was just the first step of the market realizing what this company is doing says Erik Ruben an analyst at Janus Capital It is such an extraordinary story Wall Street Journal AllStar analyst Rick Gross at Lehman Brothers agrees The natural gas analyst is quick to point out that the stock is also reflecting strength in Enrons wholesale gas and electric business and the companys success in turning its energy services business profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter Enron plans to use its network in two ways The first business is bandwidth intermediation which involves using its own network and other networks to provide businesses and Internet service providers with full bandwidth needs Enron aims to lower the cost of using networks by charging customers for only the time and space they use on the network Right now customers that need space on a network have to enter longterm contracts for preset amounts of capacity with major telecommunications providers such as ATT T and MCI WorldCom WCOM Enron has also developed a standard bandwidth contract that pools existing contracts or unused capacity that can be traded in a marketplace see story for more Basically the company plans to make money on the spread between buying and selling prices for bandwidth along with financing services The company has already proved it can profitably buy and sell natural gas and electricity contracts in the same manner Ronald Barone at PaineWebber figures that the bandwidth intermediation business will generate gross operating income of more than million in from an estimated million this year The second business is providing broadband content services such as video conferencing and streaming The company is using its own messaging software acquired from a company called Modulus along with Inktomi INKT caching software to control distribution of content across its network and RealNetworks RWNK video streaming software It is also using switch routers that control data flows made by a privately held company called Avici Systems The company expects to generate content revenue of billion in up from an estimated million this year according to Barone The whole broadband services unit is expected to spend million and lose million before interest and taxes this year Barone says But right now the stock is hardly reflecting this business says Lehmans Gross The nonbroadband business is valued at to so theres very little in the stock for its broadband assets he says Many analysts have raised their month stock price targets to to giving Enrons broadband business a value of to a share Enrons broadband strategy is catching a lot of attention but some of the established telecom companies such as MCI WorldCom WCOM doubt that it will be successful Still Global Crossing which was the first to sell bandwidth between New York and Los Angeles to Enron in December has indicated that it thinks the bandwidth trading concept can work Its just a question of when Enron is going to be a winner in bandwidth trading agrees Brad Bradshaw senior director at the Yankee Group Its going to take a while though Even if the broadband plans dont work out Enron has a thriving energy business to fall back on The company owns gas pipelines sells wholesale gas and electricity in North America both traditionally and online and manages energy needs for large companies such as Chase Manhattan CMB and Simon Property Group SPG Says Janus Ruben Its energy businesses are equally paradigmbreaking For more information and analysis of companies and mutual funds visit SmartMoneycom at

todays Motley Fool Bill Mann was at the briefing yesterday Im fairly certain well see something in todays CommDaily as well then theres the weeklies and monthlies who were there and will be coming on stream Ill keep you posted Terry FOOL ON THE HILL An Investment Opinion Enrons Telecommunications Revolution By Bill Mann Aboutstaffbillmhtm TMF Otter February Heres a juicy piece of trivia for you Can you name the company with the largest amount of business derived from ecommerce If you managed to see the title youd likely expect the answer to be Enron And youd be right Houstonbased Enron Corp NYSE ENE uberdataaspsymbolsENE processes online transactions with a notional value of million per day Enrons electricity and natural gas intermediation services manage a significant portion of the natural gas spot contracts in the United States and Canada providing service via its own natural gas pipeline network as well as providing the information system to broker sales between suppliers and purchasers In effect Enron has decided to leverage its network of pipelines by using the information about natural gas flow to help make a much more efficient system The information is then what becomes valuable with the network and the actual natural gas just being the commodity upon which the information exchange is built Enron has made some recent splashes here at The Motley Fool starting with its inclusion as a NOW Index nownowhtm company which began on the first day of trading in In just the last two weeks Enrons CEO Ken Lay appeared with Tom and David Gardner on The Motley Fool Radio Show radioradioonlinehtm and on Monday of this week George Runkle TMF Runkle wrote about it as a part of the Pathfinder Series dripportdripporthtm being undertaken in the Drip Port But what really catches my eye about Enron is its attempt to bring the same spot market efficiency to the bandwidth market as it has done with natural gas This is something really bold a company with natural gas and electric utility backgrounds Enron owns Portland General Electric the incumbent utility in northwestern Oregon moving into the telecommunications field one of the most fiercely competitive on the planet Are these people nuts Not at all Theyre crazy like foxes actually Enron is part of a rare breed a company that is perfectly willing to go out and compete for business anywhere anytime They seem to have no preconceived notions of what their business limitations are supposed to be and have never seen any such thing as a sacred cow to the point of selling off the operations that first brought them into commerce These companies to which I assign the highest regard include Nokia NYSE NOK uberdataaspsymbolsNOK CMGi Nasdaq CMGI uberdataaspsymbolsCMGI Reed Elsevier NYSE ENL uberdataaspsymbolsENL Cable Wireless NYSE CWP uberdataaspsymbolsCWP and Schlumberger NYSE SLB uberdataaspsymbolsSLB operate in different industries but they are in effect companies that trade primarily in intellectual capital Enron fits this mold as well it trades in information the commodities and services it provides are the manifestations of that information With this background in mind I jumped at the opportunity this morning to attend an informational session that Enron held in Washington DC to discuss its new initiative Enron Broadband Services presented by the CEO of EBS Joe Hirko and the Vice President of Bandwidth Trading Tom Gros What Enron proposes to do and is provisioning its network for is to create a market by which Internet Service Providers ISPs carriers brokers and end users can purchase high bandwidth capacity on a spot market Enron is initially using its existing mile fiber optic network in the US along with pooling points and other points of presence currently in US cities The concept is revolutionary Currently highbandwidth pipelines DS and higher are provisioned on a longterm contract basis and can take up to days to be brought into service This means that it is very difficult for networks to do any dynamic load management because their networks must be built to handle peak usage times that in some instances can be times as high as the low usage points Enron estimates as a result of this that even on the heaviest trafficked routes such as New YorkLos Angeles that the load factor amount of capacity that is actually used for circuits is less than What Enron is proposing would provide a way for network managers to use as much bandwidth as they need during peak times and sell it on the open market during their own lower traffic times But how can companies do this given the long lead times required to bring up and tear down circuits Enter Enron Enron has built its first two pooling points one in New York one in Los Angeles to which ISPs carriers and highdensity end users can connect These pooling points can then using Enrons network optimization protocols route the traffic from any number of customers across the same network In so doing Enron has provided its customers a solution that would otherwise be unavailable to them the ability to efficiently provision their own bandwidth needs on a timeofday hourly or onetime purchase basis So for example if Citigroup NYSE C uberdataaspsymbolsC needed to send wiring information out from its New York clearinghouse once a day from am Enron could provide them dedicated bandwidth for that transaction selling the capacity to other clients during the other hours of the day Enron can even hot roll a data stream matching supply and demand every seconds and move a customer from one dedicated circuit to another without any disruption of service to the customer There is a great deal of things that need to take place in the market before this vision becomes real such as terms of service standards legal efficiency master contracts and an increased level of interconnectivity between carriers But more importantly carriers need to be willing to change the rules of the game At least one carrier has been dismissive of Enrons entrance into their sandbox saying that theres nothing an Enron could teach them about their own business This suits Joe Hirko just fine as Enron is working to set up a liquid telecommunications market and in the end like anything else the needs of the consumers will drive the market Hirko expects that activity in a liquid bandwidth market will build through But already Enron Communications has some million in streaming contracts Seeing as Akamai Nasdaq AKAM uberdataaspsymbolsAKAM whose Internet delivery service provides network flexibility is valued at billion for million in annual sales is it any wonder why some analysts believe that Enron Communications could be worth more than all of the rest of the company If Enron succeeds in its drive to create an open broadband market its billion market cap could be a distant memory Be sure to check out our Valentines Day treat Stocks Fools Love specialsspsflhtm for a few

friend By Michael Rieke HOUSTON Dow JonesWilliams Communications Group Inc WCG news msgs has formed a bandwidth trading group in a step toward embracing standardized bandwidth trading The company was initially opposed to the idea of bandwidth trading as a commodity under standard terms and conditions so its change of opinion is being viewed by analysts as a key step toward creating a commodity market for telecommunications bandwidth Williams Communications now wants to be a leader in setting industry standards for bandwidth trading Gordon Martin president of Williams Communications carrier services told Dow Jones Newswires The company plans to draw on the commodity trading experience of Williams Co WMB news msgs Martin said Williams Co an energy company that owns of Williams Communications has been trading energy commodities such as natural gas for years Williams Communications has named Sharon Crow as vice president of bandwidth risk and optimization management She was previously a gas trader and risk manager with Williams Energy Services a unit of Williams Co Williams Communications has one of the largest interstate telecommunications networks in the United States It has recently been adding more telecommunications fiber on both the local and international level Martin said This is a market that may not be at a maturity level that others would like to think it is in terms of ability to trade Martin said Thats a clear reference to Enron Corp which proposed last year that bandwidth be traded as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Enron did the first such trade in December agreeing to buy DS bandwidth from New York and Los Angeles in monthly increments from Global Crossing Ltd GBLX news msgs A DS fiber moves data at a rate of megabits per second Tom Gros vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron said he welcomes Williams to the bandwidth trading market This is something that enables all of us to more effectively manage our bandwidth and offer more innovative solutions to our clients Williams Communications Martin is quick to point out that his company has been trading bandwidth for about years Those deals have typically been long term as long as to years Traditional bandwidth deals take weeks or even months to close as companies negotiate quantity price quality of service creditworthiness damages for nonperformance and other issues Each new deal would start again from scratch to negotiate those issues By setting standard terms and conditions to cover such issues industry players can trade bandwidth more quickly and more efficiently Crow said The resulting liquidity will add flexibility to the telecommunications industry allowing producers and users of bandwidth to manage risk Crow said Williams Communications wants to take the lead in forming a telecommunications industry committee to standardize terms for bandwidth trading Thats an aboutface for Williams Communications Last May a company official was quoted as saying that bandwidth couldnt trade as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Last December another company official spoke at a bandwidth trading conference in New York City He was still skeptical but softened the companys opposition to the idea Crow said Williams Communications and Williams Co have had a committee studying the bandwidth trading idea for more than a year The group was looking at the issue from a timing perspective to see how long it would take to become liquid Now Williams Communications wants to help spur that liquidity Part of Williams Communications change of opinion has had to do with the evolution of Enrons trading proposal It was originally seen by Williams as a proposal to trade minutes of long distance telephony minutes said a Williams official who didnt want to be identified Later it evolved into trading of highspeed data transmission bandwidth Its also become evident this year that the stock market likes the bandwidth trading idea Before Enron did its first bandwidth trade in early December its share price was less than a share Then mutual funds came in to buy large blocks of stock in December pushing the share price above the mark The share price got another shot in the arm when Enron played up bandwidth trading and its fiberoptic network at its analysts meeting Jan On Jan Enrons stock closed at a share On the day of the analysts meeting it closed at The next day it closed at The markets reaction to Enrons bandwidth position did invigorate our examination of the issue said the Williams Communication official The market had shown a willingness to reward the kind of capability we believe we had but that we hadnt brought this kind of focus to he said All the Williams Communications officials stressed that a liquid market in bandwidth would enable the company to manage risk for itself and for its customers Under the traditional longterm deals a bandwidth consumer has to buy enough bandwidth to handle its maximum needs It continues to pay for all the bandwidth even if its using only part of it at times A liquid market would allow a consumer to more closely match its bandwidth purchases with its needs Williams hopes to be pushing liquidity in certain aspects of trading like monthly deals instead of only multiyear deals said a company official The more bandwidth trades the more buyers and sellers learn about the value of individual telecommunications products he said Crow said the company is still working on an action plan to put together its trading group It could draft employees from the Williams Communications longterm trading and deal organization group the Williams Co energy commodity trading group and from outside the company As for organizing an industry group to set standards for bandwidth trading she said that could be as simple as calling other telecommunication carriers

Michael Rieke HOUSTON Dow JonesWashington DC entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on a boom in bandwidth trading His company LighTrade Inc will spend million million this year to install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth or space on telecom lines in Atlanta Chicago Denver Dallas Miami San Francisco San Jose Seattle and Washington DC Bandwidth trading is growing driven by increased demand by businesses for the Internet In a report released last December CIBC World Markets estimated that of total bandwidth traffic or billion in revenues could be traded in some manner within five years Last week Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc WCG news msgs announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites known as pooling points Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires The points connect telecommunications carriers allowing data to move from one network to another They are installed in telecom hotels buildings that house carrier facilities and essentially consist of a Lucent Technologies Inc LU news msgs bandwidth manager about the size of a tall narrow refrigerator Enron Broadband Services a unit of Enron Corp ENE news msgs established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles It plans to build another in London this year Last year Enron Corp proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized contract It executed the first trade under the contract in December buying space on a monthly basis on a New YorkLos Angeles line from Global Crossing Ltd of Bermuda Forrester Research Inc a Cambridge Massbased technology research firm has charged that Enrons ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in bandwidth trades Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the bandwidth trading market get off the ground said Stephen Kamman a telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets Its a very positive development for the bandwidth trading market said Tom Gros vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for the open trading of bandwidth Gros said The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for years Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate Companies must start from scratch with each deal negotiating price quantity length of contract and quality of service In the past deals have been longterm sometimes as long as years But with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining a year such terms are less attractive Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth trading organization an independent body that will decide on standard terms and conditions for trading Two groups in London and one in the United States are vying to form such a group LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic Pierson said Longrange plans call for the company to have sites in the US cities that develop the most traffic But the companys pace building a network of points will depend on how quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading bandwidth as a commodity LighTrade wants to install points in Boston Houston Las Vegas Memphis and Phoenix in Pierson said It is eyeing a move into international markets as early as next year if the market will support it Western Europe is a likely starting point with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites Eventually LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo and Osaka The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its bandwidth managers LighTrade has another connection to the hightech company William Plunkett a senior vice president at Lucent is on LighTrades board of directors Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would invest in his company LighTrade isnt Piersons first startup company The telecommunications attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom ARTT news msgs a NASDAQtraded company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks That company now has market capitalization of million Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three major telecommunications carriers he said He wouldnt identify the companies He said he doesnt know of any competitors building pooling points but he expects others to enter the market He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop pooling points because they dont know how quickly the market will develop he said But I wouldnt be in it if I did not think this would be a very significant economic return Pierson said By Michael Rieke

to a friend By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesWhen I first started covering the electricity industry almost three years ago people told me to talk to Thomas McAndrew one of the original power marketers considered by many to be one of the best A nuclear engineer by training McAndrew left a job at a Southern Co nuclear power plant to get a masters degree in business from Harvard in He first traded at Enron Corp ENE news msgs and then moved to the Eastern Group the US unit of Statoil Norways state energy company Statoil exited the US power and gas industry late last year McAndrew and his trading team have been doing some consulting and trading on their own account since Feb They are looking to stay together and work for another firm Meanwhile without a corporate spokesman over his shoulder McAndrew was able to speak his mind about the troubled New York Mercantile Exchange electricity contract and power shortages expected this summer He also talked about the success of Enron at trading both profitably and online and the difficulty of doing both at the same time DJ Why have the New York Mercantile Exchanges electricity contracts not worked TM The Nymex clearly lost on electronic execution of trades because now you have Bloomberg Altra and EnronOnline With the Nymex I had to call get a quote the guy didnt even stand in the ring and maybe I would get two lots I could execute times as much overthecounter with half the effort They still think they have a monopoly on clearing trades They dont realize that there are at least four companies looking into it and my guess is that within six months one of them will have a solution Now the Nymex has nothing DJ They will begin trading electricity contracts strictly electronically not in the ring at all starting March Do you think that will revive the contract TM Not really The industry pretty clearly told the Nymex last fall that what we want is electronic execution with clearing of seasonal strips not just single months But the Nymex has had the attitude consistently that they know more than the industry Theyve treated the industry in a condescending way All you can trade is the months while theres a tremendous amount of volume being traded OTC on location spreads and strips I expect the best volumes ever in the next four months All it takes is the top guys to take of their business to the Nymex and they would see tremendous growth But the only way is to have strips available April at the latest If history is the judge they wont do it They should be embarrassed Theres a lot of interest within the Nymex not to launch strips because of what they would have to do with crude oil and natural gas Theyre an exchange run by the locals How can the Nymex succeed when EnronOnline supports cent twoway spreads in the front part of the curve Its hard to justify going to a market with cents between the bid and ask just to get clearing If the Nymex doesnt have a strip product in place by April theyre done DJ What do you think of Enrons online success TM If they continue to support it the way they are its good for the market If they support it for six months and then spin it off then thats not good DJ Are they that good at trading to continue to support cent spreads TM No Are they that much better than the market Theyre obviously very good traders but not that good I dont know many traders that can do that Obviously its a great story for them The goal of EnronOnline in the short term is to generate revenue not profits DJ Enron has maintained very good trading margins for years You used to work there How do they do it TM They hire really smart people and they have a solid infrastructure and great risk management Ive been an Enron shareholder for years and will continue to be I just bought some more They are the blue chip of the new energy business risk management and now broadband Do they do everything right No but when they do something wrong they contain it and correct it They know when to ride their winners and when to cut their losses DJ Are the California Power Exchange and other pools inflating wholesale electricity prices in their states TM Theres a fundamental reason for prices going up tremendous increase in load growth without a corresponding increase in generation Realistically we should be trading in the West at the levels of PJM the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland pool but because of regulatory uncertainty were not Whats the price cap going to be this summer Nobody knows I think the California Independent System Operator is getting ready to find out about the law of unintended consequences The price cap in place is a disincentive to building generators which will lead to a shortage of power and higher prices In the rest of the country metal is going into the ground and theyre squeezing every megawatt out of existing plants There are a limited number of turbines If you went to General Electric right now youd have to wait four years for a gas turbine Where are the people that have them going to install them In California with price caps Probably not Look at the price of a fiveyear summer strip at Cinergy Youre going to put the turbines in the Midwest Even if you have to pay cents more for gas who cares You dont make prices go down by putting in price caps You make prices go down by adding supply faster than demand growth

Announcements PM To All EBS Worldwide cc Subject EBS Update EBS has realized many significant accomplishments in this first half of We continue to make excellent progress in building out the EIN as well as delivering on our two primary commercial opportunities Bandwidth Intermediation and Broadband Content Services In addition EBS continues to represent a significant portion of Enrons overall market value We are very excited about maintaining and growing our momentum We want to take this opportunity to share with you an update on our progress to date and to discuss EBS plans for the remainder of this year Development of the Enron Intelligent Network To date we have route miles of fiber owned and contracted in the US Of this fiber miles are currently lit and operational and we expect to have miles lit by the end of this year In addition we have deploye d PoPs and installed two pooling points within our US network EBS also completed the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications a leading provider of ondemand switched bandwidth services The newly named Enron Broadband Switching Systems EBSS division provides us with significantly enhanced intelligence for the network greatly enhancing our bandwi dth trading and broadband content delivery capabilities EBSS software will be incorporated into the EBS fiber optic platform to increase the speed and efficiency of our own network as well as switching capability between networks Content Services The EBS Content Services business consists of our content delivery services and distribution network During the first half of we signed landmark longterm agreements with several key content providers including Blockbust er Inc which will be publicly announced shortly to provide video on demand VOD services for Blockbusters large fulllength movie base and Bridg e Information Systems to deliver financial content and real time business new s to enterprises We have also established an effort focused on delivering broadband solution s to the rapidly evolving Applications Service Providers ASP sector Our agreement with i a leader in supply chain management software allows us to sell network services as well as jointly pursue service offerings to the rapidly growing online exchange community We also extended the EIN reach to approximately million desktops through new broadband distribution agreements with Bell South US West and SW Bell to support the distribution of rich media content Additionally we have reached an agreement with Bell Nexxia to expand the EIN into Canada which provides the basis for future distribution deals Bandwidth Intermediation Our intermediation business includes the development of highly structured bandwidth solutions for our customers as well as the EBS effort to develop and trade bandwidth directly with the market Both efforts have been extremely successful this year In addition we began offering bandwidth trades on EnronOnline in April T o date we have completed total trades with several trades being executed through EnronOnline We have recently surpassed our goal of DS months to be settled by yearend in just the first six months of the year Additionally we have signed longterm wholesale origination deals for the network with Frontier Datacom Orconet and Neon Current Metrics and Statistics Metric Current Target Total Contract Value Content Million Million DS Months Route Miles POPs Deployed Excludes Blockbuster VOD Modified from Servers Deployed due to a revised architecture for Media Cast servers We want to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone on the EBS team f or all of your hard work and for making these great strides Remaining Year Goals and Objectives While we have had an outstanding first half of the year we must focus on accomplishing some formidable financial and nonfinancial goals in the remaining six months To achieve our goals we feel we must accomplish the following Complete the fiber build of the network specifically Houston to New Orleans Increase the number of operational pooling points domestically to a nd bring online our London pooling point Ensure the highest QoS and reliability to our content and Broadband Distribution Partners BDP customers through a stable and robust streaming platform Develop an integrated and consistent service offering to our Enterprise and ASP customer base Establish sufficient liquidity and transparency in our traded bandwidth and storage products to manage risk throughout the organization and enable risk management to be profitable on a standalone basis Ensure that we have the resources accountability and focus on the service delivery side of the organization to enable us to be successful in executing on our strategy It is with these goals in mind that we make following modifications to the organization An organization chart for both EBS global and EBS Europe is attached which details all departmental reporting relationships Some of t he more significant changes are discussed below Commercial Coverage We remain convinced that we must focus our efforts on customers rather than products in order to be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in the rapidly evolving broadband marketplace Further while our service offerin gs can still be broadly defined as intermediation andor content services our marketing approach toward enterprise customers must differ substantially fr om that of our media and entertainment content customers We also are more likely to offer bundled solutions combining both streaming andor bandwidth products to the enterprise segment while our streaming platform is forefront in the minds of our media and content customers In addition there is significant potential for integrated transactions among the Enterprise Technology Partners and ASPISV customer segments To capture the tremendous opportunities these customer bases provide we have segmented our customer coverage functions into three groups Content and Distribution Services will be led by David Cox and will focus i ts efforts intensely on aggregating high bandwidth content and ensuring high quality delivery through its Broadband Distribution Partner BDP customer base Stewart Seeligson will join David Cox to provide daytoday manageme nt of our efforts in this area David will continue to focus on large commercial opportunities and provide commercial direction over the deployme nt of our streaming platform Stewart will focus on driving the commercial activities of the group April Hodgson and Steve Luginbill will report to Stewart In addition due to the scale of efforts required to make the Blockbuster agreement a success we have formed a Video on Demand VOD tea m consisting of crossfunctional expertise This team is led by Frank Bay w ho also reports to David Cox EnterpriseASP will be led jointly by Jim Crowder and Rex Shelby and will focus on providing bundled solutions to this rapidly evolving business marketplace In addition this group will continue to be responsible for o ur key strategic relationships The Wholesale Group led by Ted Seitz will continue to focus its coverage efforts on the traditional telecom sectors of carriers ISPs CLECs RBOC s global carriers and transcontinental capacity providers located in the US and Canada EBS Europe Unlike many of Enrons traditional businesses the communications busine ss is truly global in nature Therefore it is essential that we extend ourselve s internationally in areas where we can leverage our existing network and ski ll sets We feel that the European region now presents significant opportunities to EBS and we are pleased to announce that Steve Elliott former head of Network Development will be moving to London as President o f EBS Europe to head up this effort Joining Steve in London will be Kevin Kohnstamm as VP of Network and Business Implementation Steves former responsibilities will be shared by Ted Seitz who will oversee the development of the network domestically from a commercial perspective as well as manage our Canadian initiatives Jon Thomsen who wi ll consolidate our Latin American activities in Mexico and South America We will also be consolidating all of our Asian activities into one group whos e leadership we will announce shortly In addition we are pleased to announ ce that Raj Thapar has now joined us from Enron India Raj will manage all of EBS activities in India where he will work closely with the Enron Indi a team headed by Sanjay Bhatnagar Raj will report to Steve Elliott David Leatherwood and the Network Construction group will now report to Joh n Griebling in Johns capacity as head of Network Engineering and Operatio ns Product Engineering The rapidly evolving nature of the broadband streaming services business coupled with the robust capabilities of the EIN provide EBS with almost unlimited potential streaming application opportunities At the same time we must deliver on the capabilities of established products To balance th e need for execution with the need to develop new products we have segmented the former Product Development group into two efforts Diane Hetzel will lead the newly named Product Engineering group which is charged with application development and deployment on our network of all current EBS product offerings Diane will report to the Office of the Chairman Also Global Information Systems managed by Laura Beneville wi ll now report to Diane John Bloomer will head the New Products and Technology group which will

group Risk Management Systems In order to succeed in developing a broadbased product offering that can scale effectively EBS must put in place an integrated stateoftheart transactionprocessing platform This requires effective coordination of a ll risk system development activities John Echols joins EBS as head of the new Risk Systems Development and Servi ce Delivery group John brings a wealth of experience in transaction systems development from Enron North America and Enron Energy Services To ensure that we are developing appropriate risk reporting and customer service capabilities to this effort Barry Pearce and Penny Crane who head these respective functions will report to John In addition David Reece will join John as Project Manager for all risk management systems software development Broadband Operating System BOS The successful implementation of an Application Programming Interface API for broadband applications remains a key component of EBSs overall strategy The ability of applications to have access to bandwidth capacity ondemand is integral to the success of our network and the broadband marketplace in general Larry Ciscon will continue in his role as Chief Architect for the Broadband Operating System BOS Everett Plante will assume the role of Program Manager for BOS to provide the necessary linkage s to the network architecture efforts of the EIN Structuring A core competency of Enron has been its ability to identify segment appropriately price and manage risks rigorously in emerging commodity markets while continuing to be flexible enough to rank by Fortune as the most innovative company in America Across the company an effective structuring group with the proper representation of financial technical an d other assorted disciplines has been a key part of this success Towards th is end we have established the Structuring and Transaction Development group under Brad Richter and Steve Barth We also have merged the Sales Engineering group led by Merat Bagha into th e structuring group to ensure the proper technical input for all potential transactions It is essential that we support this group in its efforts by allowing structuring to review all transactions emanating from the customer coverage groups to ensure proper pricing accountability and documentation of all related risks The efforts of this group are critical in establishi ng the framework to allow our business to scale exponentially to meet the accelerating demands of the broadband marketplace Trading and Risk Management Jim Fallon formerly Managing

Communications on AM Cynthia NRON PM To Scott BoltonEnron nron Communications Stephen D NRON Chris NRON cc Joe NRON Richard ES Subject Regulatory Info and discussions on digital divide fyi Forwarded by Cynthia SandherrCorpEnron on PM From Scott NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM CDT To Cynthia NRON cc Subject Regulatory Info and discussions on digital divide Thanks for the note I will call Royce By the way there is a new book out called TeleRevolution by Richard G Tomlinson It has the MFS story in it I will be getting copy of my book for you in the next month or so Also attached is a new powerpoint I worked on over the weekend to use to discuss the Regulatory issues associated with the EBS business Look it over and lets talk Here is the memo I sent out internally A regulatory conference call precipitated a bunch of discussion last week and I have been talking to Griebling and Jim Fabout the need for an overall strategy from a regulatory perspective Below is my view of the issues and my attempt to scope the discussions that need to occur We need to hire regulatory group that has dealt with these issues in Wash DC the PUC level the city Gov level and Internationally Jim F has been given the name of a company that knows the issues and could help us decide how to proceed I consider this to be a key strategic issue for the company Also we must now be concerned about the rising movement in Wash DC to charge a tax on all revenues associated with the Internet as well as creating a Universal services fund as a result of the Digital Divide Debate This has huge financial implications if we set it up wrong and they create a tax or Universal Services fund for bridging the Digital Divide This may be one of the hottest topics in DC and the mood is very much for the Democrats to push for such a tax on all dollars spent via the Internet This would be a huge drain on EBS and other companies Enron on line could also be hurt as well as all trading deals on the net The other issue is the local loop for Wasabi and the implications of extending the pooling points to multiple carrier hotels in a city Also later to the CO Griebling has suggested we could file for a unique status get some press and bundle numerous ideas inot an entity that could sidestep the regulatory national and local loop issues in one fell swoop Would be nice We need to decide if the entity that goes to carrier hotels is the same entity that goes to the CO If the entity that goes to the CO is a CAP or a CLEC or just does a commercial deal with the CAP that does business in the City Should we do a deal with the CLEC to go to the CO or is the entity a CAP or CLEC Do we just do business with the numerous existing CLECs This has huge implications to the franchise fee we would pay to be a CAP or CLEC which would be on all revenues so we would need to limit those taxes If we choose to be a CLEC we would fall under the Universal Services fund and there could be other negative and costly requirements What entity and how we commercially get to the CO is a key decision to make We also need to make sure the entity that sells bandwidth via the Pooling points is never taxed via the Universal services fund as it exists today or could exist in the future The other issue is the status of the company that owns the fiber and the DWDM equipment is it the same company as the poolling points and the IP layer the way it is today What about the applications layer and what about the different commericial groups that need streams at the applications layer and the groups that need a Tiered QoS IP cloud Can we claim we are not the internet and would hold a special status Can the BOS and the EIN allow to claim a special status and would the pooling point extension to multiple carrier hotels allow us to have a special status Luckily the Technology for All TFA efforts is something we can point to to show how proactive industry is being in bridging the Digital Divide and there is no need for the new internet based universal service fund some are talking about That is one of the reasons that Ken Lay is on the board of TFA nationally We need to get the TFA lab installed in the DC area to show off Anyway we need to now include that open issue of a potential tax on all internet transactions in our discussions of how we structure the company and make sure we would minimize the taxes assocated with selling things on the Net Cynthia NRON PM To Scott YeagerEnron nron Communications cc Subject Hello Scott I had the pleasure of sitting by Royce Holland at a dinner

entertainment behemoth Time Warner will do little to cool the ongoing fight over how to regulate new highspeed Internet services industry watchers sa id Monday It is unclear how or whether AOL would allow competing Internet servic e providers access to its proposed cable network said industry analyst Bill Whyman of the merger currently valued at billion AOL has fought aggressively over the past year in Congress the Federal Communications Commission and with local governments to force ATT to open its highspeed cable network to competitors Its one of the monster issues said Whyman who is a principal at Legg Masons Precursor Group AOL CEO Steve Case said theyre committed to consumer choice What we dont know is whether other ISPs besides AOL will have nondiscriminatory access to Time Warner networks Whyman said the merger will likely turn the Internet into a video vehicle quicker than initially expected which will ultimately put pressure on telephone companies to speed up their deployment of high speed digital subscriber lines DSL Barbara Dooley executive director of the Commercial Internet eXchange Association said the merger proves that the marketplace is working and th at its too early to determine which way broadband will grow She added that smaller ISPs are still in a position to make deals with other broadband providers There will be other alternatives to cable she said An ISP in a particular area will not have to offer all options On the cable side ATT a frequent sparring partner with AOL over broadband issues said the merger reconfirms the importance of cable broadband The proposed deal underscores the significance of broadband distribution and it reconfirms the value of ATTs considerable broadband assets a spokeswoman said And National Cable Television Association President and CEO Robert Sac hs boasted in a statement that the deal proves that cable is the future of highspeed Internet service and that regulators have been wise to stay out of the broadband fight to date The Baby Bells remained adamant in their argument that they need regulatory relief to compete with the new mega companies like ATT and now AOL This new megacompany would be providing cable Internet and telephon y virtually regulation free said David Bolger spokesman for the United States Telecom Association which represents the Bells We have the shackl es and they dont The merger must pass muster with the Justice Department and the Federa l Communications Commission The FCC had no comment on the AOLTime Warner announcement by Rebecca S Weiner AntitrustAntitrust Anticipation Follows Merger Announcement Opponents of the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner raised antitrust concerns Monday about the monopolization of the market for highspeed Internet access and consolidation of content on the Web But proponents of the merger said the announcement underscored the marketplace abilitys to resolve competitive concerns and noted a combi ned AOLTime Warner would present a potent new competitor to Microsoft and to ATT Consumers do not want to be beholden to a giant mediaInternet dictatorship even if it promises to be a benevolent one said Andy Schwartzman president of the Media Access Project which issued a joint statement with Consumers Union the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Media Education expressing strong reservations about what would be the biggest corporate merger in US history The groups are calling for the Federal Communications Commission to require cable and other highspeed Internet access providers to open their networks to competitors and asking that ATTs ownership interests in Time Warner are severed But others dismissed those arguments noting that over the past two years we have this phenomenon whereby a new merger or technology is announced and some company is immediately put forward as the media giant said James Gattuso vice president for policy and management at the Competitive Enterprise Institute citing a string of prognostications about SBC BellAtlantic Microsoft ATT and now AOLTime Warner If consummated the merger is also likely to benefit Microsofts de fense against the Department of Justices antitrust lawsuit said William Kova cic an antitrust law expert at George Washington University Law School The fa ct that the industry environment is extremely turbulent and unpredictable and can change the position of companies in a real hurry makes it hard to prescribe remedies that wont go into affect for twoandahalf years A spokesman for Microsoft said the company had no comment on the merge r Kovacic also said he anticipated a freeforall among regulatory agencies seeking jurisdiction to review the proposed merger including the Department of Justice the Federal Trade Commission the FCC state attorne ys general municipalities public service regulatory bodies and foreign governments The mergers critics are particularly concerned that AOL will re verse its longstanding argument to force broadband networks open I think AOL CEO Steve Case is the Benedict Arnold of the digital age said Jeff Chester executive director of the Center for Media Education To me what I heard today was a reversal of their public position said Chester by Drew Clark On The Hill Lawmaker Calls For Antitrust Hearings Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman Mike DeWine ROH sa id Monday that the Judiciary Committee intends to hold hearings to scrutinize the proposed America OnlineTime Warner merger It seems that this deal could make sense for consumers by creating an organization that will deliver news and information more efficiently across the videobroadband spectrum DeWine said in a statement However whenever a dominant Internet company merges with a leading media conglomerate it raises a whole host of competition and public policy issues DeWine said One concern in particular is the impact this may hav e on the socalled marketplace of ideas We need to examine the many implications of this deal This merger also adds a new wrinkle to the broadband openaccess debate by potentially resolving it through private negotiation rather than by government regulation DeWine concluded In a statement released Monday Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Patrick Leahy DVT expressed more skepticism We will have to loo k closely at whether it makes public policy sense to consolidate control of content cable and Internet service distribution channels he said At so me point all of this concentration and convergence has implications for consumers because it will minimize competition and choice giving us fewer voices and fewer pipelines in the marketplace Although Leahy said this merger between one of the largest owners of content with the largest provider of Internet services may have been inevitable he added an element of caution is only prudent given the sco pe and impact of this planned merger The great promise of the Internet has been to allow people a wide ran ge of information sources and choices said Leahy What we should do is make sure that all that information does not become funneled and controlled by just two or three sources A spokesman for Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain RAZ said he had no comment about the proposed merger

Services Modernization Act was signe d into law some state regulators could see signs of trouble Unsure that the bill would provide adequate privacy protections for financial records stat es began hashing out the issue investigating consumer privacy and launching committees dedicated to exploring options Those efforts have proven fruitful With privacy advocates lamenting the final results in S the pressure is seeping into the states to protect personal information Howeve r there are precious few that foreshadowed the federal governments game of catch to the states on the issue of privacy Now privacy advocates are bombarding state capitals urging them to take action that the federal government didnt What didnt happen at the federal level was an optin policy for shari ng of consumer information The legislation which provided a legal framework for financial services megamergers permits banks to share their customers information with other businesses such as brokerages insurance firms and telemarketers To reveal customers personallyidentifiable information wit h outside partners the financial institutions must provide consumers the opportunity to optout of the sharing arrangement This means that bank customers would need to notify a bank that they are against the disclosure of their personal information if they dont alert the bank their information would automatically be up for grabs An amendment introduced by Sen Paul Sarbanes DMD secures the right of states to pass stricter informationsharing regulations While privacy advocates are satiated by th e provision they would have preferred language that required consumers to optin to all informationsharing practices Now they hope to see that typ e of policy enacted in the states Building A Framework There are a handful of states that already had begun work in the priva cy arena One is Minnesota which catapulted itself into the national privacy spotlight in June when Attorney General Mike Hatch launched an investigatio n and lawsuit against US Bank for giving out personal financial information to a telemarketing company The telemarketers after calling customers and inquiring whether they wanted additional information about bank services charged the customers for the services Hatch alleged that the bank release d the information for million plus commissions some of which he said were gained by disclosing deceptive information Under the settlement the bank donated over million to charities around the state and agreed to make refunds to Minnesota customers who were victims of the scheme It also enacted an optout policy among other penalties Minnesota was one of the most outspoken opponents of the federal legislation saying that it was ev en weaker than the settlement we got according to Hatchs press secretary Leslie Sandburg Consumers Unions David Butler called Minnesota as proactive as any state at this point for their prosecution of US Bank but added that th is is still a relatively new debate at the state level Some observers anticipate that with the passage of the federal bank bill states may become more alert to the issues at hand This will force states to look directly at the issue said Brett Hester the National Governors Associations economic development policy analyst John Ryan of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors agreed Its a hot issue an easily political issue he said You have elected officials who may want to make an issue out of this Minnesota taking advantage of the Sarbanes amendment will introduce legislation next session to the tune of protectin g consumer privacy Also at the fore is Massachusetts Lieutenant Gov Jane Swift R and Gov Paul Cellucci In a recent speech Swift railed against the federal legislation saying that both Congress and the administration missed out on a historic opportunity to ensure privacy protections Now that the federal government has determined that states should decide some privacy issues for their citizens Swift said we in Massachusetts are pleased to be at the forefront of this crucial national debate At the crux of the administrations plan is the establishment of an optin system that require s businesses to seek consumers consent before they sell or share information Governor Cellucci and I dont think that this is too much to ask she added The legislations initiative grew out of a qualityoflife commission established by the governor The group determined that privacy was one of t he hottest issues and from that grew the omnibus legislation that has been se nt to five different legislative hearings and two public hearings explained John Ziemba deputy general counsel and deputy director of the Office of Consumer Affairs Most committees are still looking at the legislation and will wrapup their investigations next year as the Massachusetts legislatu re completes its twoyear term While Massachusetts remains one of the few states specifically targeti ng financial privacy a host of others are joining the bandwagon in the hopes of ensuring consumer protection in other hightech areas New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer joined the group of state attorneys general upset wit h the weak protections in the federal bank bill but it wasnt the first time he had entered the arena He had ushered through a spam bill allowing consumers the right to optout of receiving unsolicited bulk email a nd a bill that would prohibit Web site owners from tracking consumer information unless users consented to the actions said spokeswoman Christine Pritchard Now the focus has turned to reforming the Fair Credit Reporting Act which among other things would provide consumers the right to receive one free credit report each year to determine its accuracy And Spitzer also has promoted a bill on identity theft declaring that if a consumers identity has been stolen to obtain anything of value the customer and not just the credit card company is deemed a victim and can seek reimbursement Honing In On The Hot Topics Identity theft perhaps because of the personal stories that result fr om it is one of the hotter privacy issues in the states and Arizona is worki ng on a law making it a crime to steal a personal password Rep Jeff HatchMiller R who chairs the states Internet study commission said tha t legislators are just beginning to understand the new level of concern being raised by citizens with respect to their right to privacy The group has established a subcommittee looking into additional privacy legislation that may be needed with the understanding that the rules must seek a balance between protecting consumers and businesses alike Arizona is a fairly conservative state HatchMiller said Were friendly to business here To the extent possible I think well promote private solutions as we do prefer them to government solutions HatchMiller added that one of the newest areas of concern is information from customer convenience cards such as those given out by grocery stores to determine sale prices being sold to outside marketers California already has seen legislation introduced that would bar the sale of that information and its legislatures Joint Task Force on Personal Information and Privacy continues to look at that as well as all issues surrounding privacy Sen Jackie Speier DSan FranciscoSan Mateo is expected to soon drop a bill complementing the Financial Services Modernization Act that would prohibit the sharing of personal information among affiliate companies in different sectors Although because of the strong banking lobby and the political difficulties surrounding the issue staffers say they still dont know what form the bill will take That seems to be a familiar refrain in such discussions as many elect ed officials grapple with the growing number of privacy concerns that technological advances have ushered in Many legislators looking to the federal government for guidance on the matter have been thrown an unexpecte d duty with the results in the financial services act but observers say they will take the ball and run with it I think what will happen is youll see legislation in areas where there may be problems predicted Neal Osten director of the commerce and communications committee for the National Conference of State Legislatures by Stephanie Lash

York City whe n the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce held its last meeting midSeptember Sensing impending travel catastrophes coupled with a mass exodus down the shoreline to Washington after the sessions adjournment th e group appeased a eleventhhour call from Utah Gov Michael Leavitt R to request proposals from the public on how to best deal with the prospect of taxing ecommerce And this week after around proposals were submitted to the commission a different kind of storm began to brew Consumer advocacy groups local government organizations and commissionwatchers unleashed a flurry of press releases and media events t o announce their proposals which were due to the commission on Nov Many of the submissions which were called to meet a set of criteria ranging from meeting constitutional muster to radically simplifying the sales ta x system responded to Leavitts plan Also due on that date were comments t o be considered for the reportdrafting subcommittees issues and options paper which will serve as a compilation of ideas on the topic of electroni c commerce and taxation for the entire commission to consider while it drafts its final recommendation What I think were seeing is a tremendously positive development sa id Jim Lucier a Prudential analyst who worked with Americans for Tax Reforms Grover Norquist as he lobbied while the legislation creating the commission was being drafted Instead of constantly squabbling you have important groups within the commission working hard to get majority positions Because infighting has plagued the commission from its beginning a majority may be the most difficult endeavor many of these groups have worke d for The member commission needs a twothirds majority vote to approve a ny recommendation and the group already has shifted into pro and antitax factions with only a few still undecided The proposals are making their rounds among the commissionmembers and the next meeting is Dec While there are a host of groups that have submitted their propositions it appear s that three are getting the majority of the commissions attention and one specifically because it was drafted by the groups chairman Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore Following is a synopses and analysis of the three plans that have the best chance of succeeding Title Streamlined Sales Tax System for the st Century ZeroBurden Pl an Sponsor National Governors Association National Conference of State Legislatures National Association of Counties US Conference of Mayors Council of State Governments International City County Management Association While the remaining member of the Big Seven local organizations the National League of Cities has backed the proposals intent it is waiting until its annual meeting in December to vote on supporting it officially Description The idea centers around establishing a trusted third party or tax clearinghouse to collect and remit sales taxes based on the purchaser s tax jurisdiction When an online order is placed the seller would notify t he clearinghouse and credit card company to determine the jurisdiction of the buyer The third party would notify the seller of the appropriate tax amoun t the credit card company would collect the funds and then remit the tax to t he clearinghouse The clearinghouse would then distribute the funds to the states and localities and would be paid by a percentage of what it collects The third parties would be licensed by the state and the necessary software required of each vendor would be paid for by the state History The plan was drafted after a series of marathon meetings by the local organizations that argue they are jeopardized because of lost sales t ax revenues from ecommerce Organizers of the proposal which is being touted by Gov Leavitt say that regardless of the commissions final decision the y will begin pushing the system to state legislatures for adoption Under the Internet Tax Freedom Act no new taxes may be applied to ecommerce but existing taxes such as sales and use taxes are not covered The sponsors say they do not need the commissions goahead in order to implement the system which would be optional by state and would not require all state s involvement to function Comments The plan is widely criticized by antita x advocates and those who believe that taxing ecommerce will stifle its growth Others say that the protax movement is only supported by the national government organizations and not their members with Leavitt being the notable exception and criticize it for not receiving many other individuals support But the organizations argue that unless states and localities have the right to determine revenueraising activities control of local services like education and law enforcement ultimately will be given to the federal government Thomas Jefferson would roll over in his grave if that happens Leavitt said Title EFreedom Coalition Proposal Sponsors The EFreedom Coalitions membership involves over organizations including Americans for Tax Reform Citizens Against Government Waste Competitive Enterprise Institute Consumer Alert Heritag e Foundation Progress and Freedom Foundation and State Policy Network Description The group supports a ban on collection of sales taxes on electronic commerce and the repeal of the percent federal excise tax on telecommunications It also would ban discriminatory Internet taxation and taxes on Internet access The group endorses slashing local telecommunications taxes and wants to see interstate telecom property taxes reduced and controlled with federal protections History The EFreedom Coalition unveiled its proposal at a joint press conference with legislatio n by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich ROH that would ban Intern et sales taxes Kasichs Internet Tax Elimination Act HR would make permanent the threeyear moratorium on discriminatory Internet taxes passed in the Internet Tax Freedom Act Fellow Ohio Republican John Boehner joined Kasich in sponsoring the measure Comments Americans for Tax Reforms Norquist has led the antitax movement on the commission Stan Sokul an independent consultant for the Association for Interactive Media was also o n hand to support the proposal Advocates are promoting the plan by saying it would protect consumers privacy by not collecting personal information fro m users to determine tax jurisdictions Title No Internet Tax Sponsor Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore R chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce Description Gilmores proposal is almost identical in ideology to the EFreedom Coalition plan He maintains Congress should ban all sales and use taxes on ecommerce and protect businesses from state income and business activity taxes simply because of their virtual presence in a state Gilmore also has proposed the elimination of the percent federal excise tax on telecommunications and has called for the federal government to give states billion each year for the lost revenue from the repeal of sales taxes on ecommerce transactions He also has proposed that states be allowed to use federal welfare money to purchase computers a nd Internet access for needy families History Gilmores outline was submitted to the policies and options paper that the commission is preparing not under the call for proposals suggeste d by Leavitt But because he is the chair of the commission and had maintaine d that he would remain neutral Gilmores actions have received criticism fro m many on the state and local side of the debate But he has defended his actions After hearing dozens of experts on an entire range of ecommerce issues I felt it was time to put forward my vision It can be summarized i n three words No Internet Tax Gilmore said in a recent speech Observers have speculated that Gilmores plan could be meshed with the EFreedom Coalitions to come up with a proposal agreeable to both parties And suggestions such as the welfare provision even have appeased protax groups which have said solutions such as those may be the most agreeable for a consensus statement Comments The National Association of Counties and oth er local groups remain opposed to the plans provisions calling for the federa l government to allot funds to localities The fact remains that Gilmores proposal means county officials will be even more dependent on state and federal governments to fund their local services said NACos Executive Director Larry Naake This isnt my idea of returning more control and authority to the local citizen by Stephanie Lash

NRON AM To Scott BoltonEnron nron Communications cc Cynthia NRON Joe NRON Chris NRON Steven J ES Richard ES Subject Internet Language DROPPED from Satellite TV bill Scott Just to follow up on my email and voice mail messaged to you language that would have barred internet companies from obtaining the licenses to transmit movies sporting events and other broadcast programs was DROPPED from HR the satellite TV bill which is attached to HR the omnibus appropriations legislation Please see the CQ article below for more information on the legislation in general We will certainly continue to watch for language like this that might surface in future legislation In the context of ECIs larger legislative agenda we may also want to explore the potential to develop legislation that would proactively ensure the broadcast of licensed programming over the internet Cheers Jeff TELECOMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE BILL SURVIVES A SCARE CARRIES OTHER MEASURES WITH IT By Alan K Ota CQ Staff Writer Nov The uproar in the Senate Thursday over deletion of a loan guarantee program designed to improve rural television service nearly obscured the significance of the satellite television bill that was linked to the fiscal omnibus spending bill HR The controversial provision would have created a new Agriculture Department program to guarantee billion in loans enabling satellite providers to transmit local programming to rural subscribers service they insist is too expensive to provide without help It was added to the satellite TV bill HR in conference but dropped when the final version S was referenced in HR Ruralstate senators led by Max Baucus RMont blocked action on a stopgap funding bill HJRES until leaders promised them a floor vote on the loan guarantee legislation or similar provisions by next April Also dropped from the final bill was language that would haved barred Internet service providers from obtaining the licenses necessary to transmit movies sports events and other broadcast programming Cable and satellite providers would be the only entities with such licenses America Online and other companies lobbied furiously to strip the provision The final measure would for the first time allow satellite companies to beam local news sports weather and other broadcast programming to all of their customers just as cable providers do And it would grant a reprieve to more than a million satellite subscribers now receiving local channels who otherwise would lose those signals by years end A court had ruled the subscribers do not qualify to receive local signals by satellite under current law Satellite companies would have to gain permission from local broadcast stations within six months after they begin retransmitting those signals By Jan satellite carriers that transmit local channels would have to carry all of the channels in that community a mustcarry requirement already imposed on cable providers The measure would extend for five years the licenses under which satellite companies retransmit the signals of superstations and distant network stations and reduce the copyright fees they must pay The bill would generally retain existing standards for determining which subscribers are eligible to receive distant network signals by satellite but it would require the Federal Communications Commission to review its model for determining which areas are unable to receive acceptablequality broadcast signals over the air Like the conference report on HR the final satellite bill carries a number of pieces of unrelated legislation Patent Overhaul In a victory for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G Hatch RUtah negotiators included a patent system overhaul bill HR that was strongly opposed by some inventors and by the Eagle Forum a conservative group headed by political activist Phyllis Schlafly who argued that it would permit foreign companies to steal American technology The bill would require publication of some patent applications which have been filed both in the United States and abroad within months of filing whether or not patents have been granted The measure also would require the Patent and Trademark Office to approve or reject a patent application within three years It would provide patent term extensions for any not approved within that threeyear period to guarantee investors a year patent term Currently patents are for years but inventors often lose years waiting for approval of their applications LowPower TV Stations The omnibus spending bill also included provisions of a bill HR to create a new Class A license for lowpower television stations equivalent to those granted to fullservice primary stations The provisions are designed to help lowpower stations that often provide niche programming in urban areas and local programming in rural areas become more stable and commercially viable Cybersquatting The measure includes provisions of a bill S to bar unauthorized use of trademarkprotected brand names in Internet addresses The bill was passed by the Senate by voice vote Aug the House passed a different version Oct PBS Donor Lists In response to disclosures earlier this year that some public broadcast stations had exchanged donor lists with political parties and primarily with Democratic Party units negotiators included a provision to prohibit such stations from sharing their donor lists with political parties It also would bar disclosure of its donors to any nonaffiliated group without the donors consent Rep Cliff Stearns RFla had introduced legislation HR earlier this year to prohibit the listsharing but the bill did not advance

<31484223.1075843083570.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,scott.bolton@enron.com,1999-11-11 01:33:00,Info Update storiesMAX SMETANNIKOV InterActive Week Idea is to build on streaming content delivery While Akamai Technologies and recently acquired Sandpiper Networks have captured the majority of mind share as leaders in the emerging content distribution market Enron Communications is making a bid to blend together its assets as a national carrier to beat back the startups and make some major waves in the content delivery business Last week Portland Orebased carrier Enron wwwenronnet announced it has broadened its content distribution network to focus on streaming media The intensified pursuit of the content distribution space is likely to come as a surprise to competitors that perceive the carrier as more of a bandwidth wholesaler However company executives say content distribution ofvarious kinds is what Enron is all about What we do is exactly what they Akamai do says Joe Hirko Enron president and chief executive The difference is that their services are acceptable for some content that isnt missioncntical and we have that same model and we do that for missioncrincal content Just like Akamai and Sandpiper Enron is colocating its media distribution servers with other Internet service providers ISPs members of the socalled ePowered Distribution Program making it possible for Enron to reserve bandwidth on partners networks The differentiator that Enron brings to the table is its qualityofservice guarantee backed by an elaborate network architecture and business model that Enron is building which relies on a combination of alliances and a bandwidth broker exchange First Enron has built its own content distribution network with servers colocated with other ISPs These carriers include Epoch Internet Electric Lightwave FlashNet Communications GTE Intenetworking InterNap NetRail NorthPoint Communications RCN and Veno Enron is also pursuing satellite providers as another group of carriers capable of distributing content in geographically remote places where fiber networks are not present yet While traditional content distributors measure their footprint in servers distributed with other hackhones Enron uses its points of presence and the number ofdesktops reached as its basic metrics Enron says it can shoot audio and video streams to million desktops via POPs Second Enron is in the final stages of establishing its own bandwidth exchange a division that would trade space on other carriers networks as a way to provision bandwidth on demand Hirko says six interconnection points for carriers that want to trade on this exchange have been built and the first trades will start before the end of the year This would be the first time a bandwidth exchange business model in itself a nascent idea would be married to content distribution as the means to bring down the cost of streaming media distribution This is something completely new I have not seen anything like this says Tim Strong an analyst at consultancy TeleGeography in Washington DC The result is essentially complete control over the pipe delivering voice and video a position of power that Hirko says will lead to unmatched performance We are talking frames a second Hirko says adding that it is not uncommon to tap into streaming video feeds as low as two or three frames per second Enron plans to charge its users less than cents per megabyte delivered Akamai wwwakamaicom which doesnt own its own network and uses the Internet as the means of streaming media delivery also plans to guarantee nearzero packet loss with its patentpending yettobelaunched service called Steady Stream The biggest challenge for Enron is to convince potential customers that the carrier is more than simply a bandwidth provider To date Enrons only public streaming media client is CountryCoolcom Enron officials see an opportunity to barge into the industry by commandeering the unconquered segment of the content distribution market streaming media where Akamai and Sandpiper have yet to make a name We are using Akamai for distribution of objects and static images says Monty Mullig vice president of CNN Internet Technologies Its possible Akamai might work for streaming media but I have not seen that product from them yet CNN Interactive is distributing most of its video through Intervu one of the first providers of streaming media services While Mullig is intrigued by the prospects of Enrons bandwidth exchange services he has yet to be convinced the company offers a compeffing service They havent put a product in front of us that we would be interested in Mullig says We want a big audience behind the service that we buy like Akamais On its face value Enrons network is not any more interesting than networks of other players their size The master plan National carrier Enron cites four building blocks as the foundation for its content distribution service

by Cynthia SandherrCorpEnron on PM From Scott NRON COMMUNICATIONS on AM CDT To Cynthia NRON cc Subject Regulatory Info and discussions on digital divide Thanks for the note I will call Royce By the way there is a new book out called TeleRevolution by Richard G Tomlinson It has the MFS story in it I will be getting copy of my book for you in the next month or so Also attached is a new powerpoint I worked on over the weekend to use to discuss the Regulatory issues associated with the EBS business Look it over and lets talk Here is the memo I sent out internally A regulatory conference call precipitated a bunch of discussion last week and I have been talking to Griebling and Jim Fabout the need for an overall strategy from a regulatory perspective Below is my view of the issues and my attempt to scope the discussions that need to occur We need to hire regulatory group that has dealt with these issues in Wash DC the PUC level the city Gov level and Internationally Jim F has been given the name of a company that knows the issues and could help us decide how to proceed I consider this to be a key strategic issue for the company Also we must now be concerned about the rising movement in Wash DC to charge a tax on all revenues associated with the Internet as well as creating a Universal services fund as a result of the Digital Divide Debate This has huge financial implications if we set it up wrong and they create a tax or Universal Services fund for bridging the Digital Divide This may be one of the hottest topics in DC and the mood is very much for the Democrats to push for such a tax on all dollars spent via the Internet This would be a huge drain on EBS and other companies Enron on line could also be hurt as well as all trading deals on the net The other issue is the local loop for Wasabi and the implications of extending the pooling points to multiple carrier hotels in a city Also later to the CO Griebling has suggested we could file for a unique status get some press and bundle numerous ideas inot an entity that could sidestep the regulatory national and local loop issues in one fell swoop Would be nice We need to decide if the entity that goes to carrier hotels is the same entity that goes to the CO If the entity that goes to the CO is a CAP or a CLEC or just does a commercial deal with the CAP that does business in the City Should we do a deal with the CLEC to go to the CO or is the entity a CAP or CLEC Do we just do business with the numerous existing CLECs This has huge implications to the franchise fee we would pay to be a CAP or CLEC which would be on all revenues so we would need to limit those taxes If we choose to be a CLEC we would fall under the Universal Services fund and there could be other negative and costly requirements What entity and how we commercially get to the CO is a key decision to make We also need to make sure the entity that sells bandwidth via the Pooling points is never taxed via the Universal services fund as it exists today or could exist in the future The other issue is the status of the company that owns the fiber and the DWDM equipment is it the same company as the poolling points and the IP layer the way it is today What about the applications layer and what about the different commericial groups that need streams at the applications layer and the groups that need a Tiered QoS IP cloud Can we claim we are not the internet and would hold a special status Can the BOS and the EIN allow to claim a special status and would the pooling point extension to multiple carrier hotels allow us to have a special status Luckily the Technology for All TFA efforts is something we can point to to show how proactive industry is being in bridging the Digital Divide and there is no need for the new internet based universal service fund some are talking about That is one of the reasons that Ken Lay is on the board of TFA nationally We need to get the TFA lab installed in the DC area to show off Anyway we need to now include that open issue of a potential tax on all internet transactions in our discussions of how we structure the company and make sure we would minimize the taxes assocated with selling things on the Net Cynthia NRON PM To Scott YeagerEnron nron Communications cc Subject Hello Scott I had the pleasure of sitting by Royce Holland at a dinner

Announcements PM To All EBS Worldwide cc Subject EBS Update EBS has realized many significant accomplishments in this first half of We continue to make excellent progress in building out the EIN as well as delivering on our two primary commercial opportunities Bandwidth Intermediation and Broadband Content Services In addition EBS continues to represent a significant portion of Enrons overall market value We are very excited about maintaining and growing our momentum We want to take this opportunity to share with you an update on our progress to date and to discuss EBS plans for the remainder of this year Development of the Enron Intelligent Network To date we have route miles of fiber owned and contracted in the US Of this fiber miles are currently lit and operational and we expect to have miles lit by the end of this year In addition we have deploye d PoPs and installed two pooling points within our US network EBS also completed the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications a leading provider of ondemand switched bandwidth services The newly named Enron Broadband Switching Systems EBSS division provides us with significantly enhanced intelligence for the network greatly enhancing our bandwi dth trading and broadband content delivery capabilities EBSS software will be incorporated into the EBS fiber optic platform to increase the speed and efficiency of our own network as well as switching capability between networks Content Services The EBS Content Services business consists of our content delivery services and distribution network During the first half of we signed landmark longterm agreements with several key content providers including Blockbust er Inc which will be publicly announced shortly to provide video on demand VOD services for Blockbusters large fulllength movie base and Bridg e Information Systems to deliver financial content and real time business new s to enterprises We have also established an effort focused on delivering broadband solution s to the rapidly evolving Applications Service Providers ASP sector Our agreement with i a leader in supply chain management software allows us to sell network services as well as jointly pursue service offerings to the rapidly growing online exchange community We also extended the EIN reach to approximately million desktops through new broadband distribution agreements with Bell South US West and SW Bell to support the distribution of rich media content Additionally we have reached an agreement with Bell Nexxia to expand the EIN into Canada which provides the basis for future distribution deals Bandwidth Intermediation Our intermediation business includes the development of highly structured bandwidth solutions for our customers as well as the EBS effort to develop and trade bandwidth directly with the market Both efforts have been extremely successful this year In addition we began offering bandwidth trades on EnronOnline in April T o date we have completed total trades with several trades being executed through EnronOnline We have recently surpassed our goal of DS months to be settled by yearend in just the first six months of the year Additionally we have signed longterm wholesale origination deals for the network with Frontier Datacom Orconet and Neon Current Metrics and Statistics Metric Current Target Total Contract Value Content Million Million DS Months Route Miles POPs Deployed Excludes Blockbuster VOD Modified from Servers Deployed due to a revised architecture for Media Cast servers We want to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone on the EBS team f or all of your hard work and for making these great strides Remaining Year Goals and Objectives While we have had an outstanding first half of the year we must focus on accomplishing some formidable financial and nonfinancial goals in the remaining six months To achieve our goals we feel we must accomplish the following Complete the fiber build of the network specifically Houston to New Orleans Increase the number of operational pooling points domestically to a nd bring online our London pooling point Ensure the highest QoS and reliability to our content and Broadband Distribution Partners BDP customers through a stable and robust streaming platform Develop an integrated and consistent service offering to our Enterprise and ASP customer base Establish sufficient liquidity and transparency in our traded bandwidth and storage products to manage risk throughout the organization and enable risk management to be profitable on a standalone basis Ensure that we have the resources accountability and focus on the service delivery side of the organization to enable us to be successful in executing on our strategy It is with these goals in mind that we make following modifications to the organization An organization chart for both EBS global and EBS Europe is attached which details all departmental reporting relationships Some of t he more significant changes are discussed below Commercial Coverage We remain convinced that we must focus our efforts on customers rather than products in order to be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in the rapidly evolving broadband marketplace Further while our service offerin gs can still be broadly defined as intermediation andor content services our marketing approach toward enterprise customers must differ substantially fr om that of our media and entertainment content customers We also are more likely to offer bundled solutions combining both streaming andor bandwidth products to the enterprise segment while our streaming platform is forefront in the minds of our media and content customers In addition there is significant potential for integrated transactions among the Enterprise Technology Partners and ASPISV customer segments To capture the tremendous opportunities these customer bases provide we have segmented our customer coverage functions into three groups Content and Distribution Services will be led by David Cox and will focus i ts efforts intensely on aggregating high bandwidth content and ensuring high quality delivery through its Broadband Distribution Partner BDP customer base Stewart Seeligson will join David Cox to provide daytoday manageme nt of our efforts in this area David will continue to focus on large commercial opportunities and provide commercial direction over the deployme nt of our streaming platform Stewart will focus on driving the commercial activities of the group April Hodgson and Steve Luginbill will report to Stewart In addition due to the scale of efforts required to make the Blockbuster agreement a success we have formed a Video on Demand VOD tea m consisting of crossfunctional expertise This team is led by Frank Bay w ho also reports to David Cox EnterpriseASP will be led jointly by Jim Crowder and Rex Shelby and will focus on providing bundled solutions to this rapidly evolving business marketplace In addition this group will continue to be responsible for o ur key strategic relationships The Wholesale Group led by Ted Seitz will continue to focus its coverage efforts on the traditional telecom sectors of carriers ISPs CLECs RBOC s global carriers and transcontinental capacity providers located in the US and Canada EBS Europe Unlike many of Enrons traditional businesses the communications busine ss is truly global in nature Therefore it is essential that we extend ourselve s internationally in areas where we can leverage our existing network and ski ll sets We feel that the European region now presents significant opportunities to EBS and we are pleased to announce that Steve Elliott former head of Network Development will be moving to London as President o f EBS Europe to head up this effort Joining Steve in London will be Kevin Kohnstamm as VP of Network and Business Implementation Steves former responsibilities will be shared by Ted Seitz who will oversee the development of the network domestically from a commercial perspective as well as manage our Canadian initiatives Jon Thomsen who wi ll consolidate our Latin American activities in Mexico and South America We will also be consolidating all of our Asian activities into one group whos e leadership we will announce shortly In addition we are pleased to announ ce that Raj Thapar has now joined us from Enron India Raj will manage all of EBS activities in India where he will work closely with the Enron Indi a team headed by Sanjay Bhatnagar Raj will report to Steve Elliott David Leatherwood and the Network Construction group will now report to Joh n Griebling in Johns capacity as head of Network Engineering and Operatio ns Product Engineering The rapidly evolving nature of the broadband streaming services business coupled with the robust capabilities of the EIN provide EBS with almost unlimited potential streaming application opportunities At the same time we must deliver on the capabilities of established products To balance th e need for execution with the need to develop new products we have segmented the former Product Development group into two efforts Diane Hetzel will lead the newly named Product Engineering group which is charged with application development and deployment on our network of all current EBS product offerings Diane will report to the Office of the Chairman Also Global Information Systems managed by Laura Beneville wi ll now report to Diane John Bloomer will head the New Products and Technology group which will identify emerging product and technology opportunities with the goal of eventual commercialization and integration into our product offering John will report to Scott Yeagers Strategic Development group Risk Management Systems In order to succeed in developing a broadbased product offering that can scale effectively EBS must put in place an integrated stateoftheart transactionprocessing platform This requires effective coordination of a ll risk system development activities John Echols joins EBS as head of the new Risk Systems Development and Servi ce Delivery group John brings a wealth of experience in transaction systems development from Enron North America and Enron Energy Services To ensure that we are developing appropriate risk reporting and customer service capabilities to this effort Barry Pearce and Penny Crane who head these respective functions will report to John In addition David Reece will join John as Project Manager for all risk management systems software development Broadband Operating System BOS The successful implementation of an Application Programming Interface API for broadband applications remains a key component of EBSs overall strategy The ability of applications to have access to bandwidth capacity ondemand is integral to the success of our network and the broadband marketplace in general Larry Ciscon will continue in his role as Chief Architect for the Broadband Operating System BOS Everett Plante will assume the role of Program Manager for BOS to provide the necessary linkage s to the network architecture efforts of the EIN Structuring A core competency of Enron has been its ability to identify segment appropriately price and manage risks rigorously in emerging commodity markets while continuing to be flexible enough to rank by Fortune as the most innovative company in America Across the company an effective structuring group with the proper representation of financial technical an d other assorted disciplines has been a key part of this success Towards th is end we have established the Structuring and Transaction Development group under Brad Richter and Steve Barth We also have merged the Sales Engineering group led by Merat Bagha into th e structuring group to ensure the proper technical input for all potential transactions It is essential that we support this group in its efforts by allowing structuring to review all transactions emanating from the customer coverage groups to ensure proper pricing accountability and documentation of all related risks The efforts of this group are critical in establishi ng the framework to allow our business to scale exponentially to meet the accelerating demands of the broadband marketplace Trading and Risk Management Jim Fallon formerly Managing Director of Power Trading and Risk Management for Enron North America has joined EBS as head of Global Risk Management Jim and his team is charged with replicating the successful trading platfor m he built in North America into a bandwidth trading platform for EBS Paul Racicot VP of Bandwidth Trading will head the North America trading desk and Marcello Romano Director of Bandwidth Trading will head this function in Europe while reporting jointly to both Jim and Steve Elliott As previously announced VP John Scoblick will head real estate risk and IRU Management led by Andy Unverzagt will also report to Jim Warpspeed Acquisition We highlighted above the significance of the Warpspeed acquisition Terry Stavropoulos VP Mike Golden EBSSCTO and Andy Rundquist architect lea d Enron Broadband Switching Systems formerly Warpspeed We welcome the EBSS team of employees to the EBS team Staff Functions Kelly Kimberly formerly Senior VP of Marketing Communication and PR for Enrons international companies now leads that function for EBS as well as overseeing the Market Interface and Intelligence group headed by VP Tony Mends It is critical that our external message be consistent to ensure we are communicating EBS strategy effectively Toward this end the marke ting representatives formerly in the verticals will now report directly to Kel ly As was recently announced Marla Barnard is now leading the HR function for EBS We recognize that intellectual capital is our most important resource Marla will focus on keeping EBS competitive by developing strategies to ensure that EBS is able to attract develop and retain the best talent in t he industry We are in a rapidly changing and dynamic industry While our strategy and overall objectives will remain unchanged we must continue to be flexible o n how we execute on our strategy and achieve our objectives to effectively respond to the changing needs of our customers and to new opportunities in the marketplace This requires timely modifications to our organization We are convinced that we have a winning strategy and the best team in the worl d to execute on our strategy While we have accomplished a great deal in the first six

Michael Rieke HOUSTON Dow JonesFollowing up on its February pledge to be a leader in developing a liquid market for telecommunications bandwidth Williams Communications Group WCG news msgs will host a meeting of telecom carriers next week Ken Epps senior vice president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications told Dow Jones Newswires that the first objective for the meeting will be understanding any concerns carriers might have about a market for standardized trading of bandwidth Thats a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company wasnt impressed last May when Enron Corp ENE news msgs suggested trading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Bandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks Many observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams Communications After all of its stock is owned by Williams Co WMB news msgs which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and natural gas for years But Williams Communications didnt get behind the idea until February when it told industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group The new group includes Sharon Crow who had been a gas trader and risk manager with Williams Energy Services a unit of Williams Co She is now vice president of bandwidth trading for Williams Communications Since then a number of other companies have said they want to play in that market Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs El Paso Energy Corp EPG news msgs Columbia Transmission Communications a unit of Columbia Energy Group CG news msgs and Koch Industries Those companies all have one thing in common and it isnt ownership of telecommunications bandwidth They all have years of experience trading energy commodities Last month companies from the energy side joined some carriers and others interested in standardized trading of bandwidth at a meeting put together by CompTel a telecom industry trade association At that meeting they decided who would be considered principals in the bandwidth trading market companies that will take title to or own bandwidth In other words principals will be either telecom carriers or companies that will buy and sell bandwidth to manage risk in the telecommunications industry They also formed a committee of principals to study standard terms and conditions needed to establish a liquid market for bandwidth trading People who attended the meeting said two of the largest carriers were missing at the CompTel meeting MCI WorldCom WCOM news msgs was there but ATT T news msgs and Sprint FON news msgs werent The meeting next week which starts Monday is for telecom carriers only Epps said This week he wouldnt mention names of the companies invited but last month he told Dow Jones Newswires his companys meeting would include the real players the MCI WorldComms the Qwests Q news msgs the ATTs Its about people who have the assets and how we use these to advantage the marketplace how we build a good

for standardized trading of bandwidth Thats a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company wasnt impressed last May when Enron Corp ENE news msgs suggested trading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Bandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks Many observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams Communications After all of its stock is owned by Williams Co WMB news msgs which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and natural gas for years But Williams Communications didnt get behind the idea until February when it told industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group The new group includes Sharon Crow who had been a gas trader and risk manager with Williams Energy Services a unit of Williams Co She is now vice president of bandwidth trading for Williams Communications Since then a number of other companies have said they want to play in that market Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs El Paso Energy Corp EPG news msgs Columbia Transmission Communications a unit of Columbia Energy Group CG news msgs and Koch Industries Those companies all have one thing in common and it isnt ownership of telecommunications bandwidth They all have years of experience trading energy commodities Last month companies from the energy side joined some carriers and others interested in standardized trading of bandwidth at a meeting put together by CompTel a telecom industry trade association At that meeting they decided who would be considered principals in the bandwidth trading market companies that will take title to or own bandwidth In other words principals will be either telecom carriers or companies that will buy and sell bandwidth to manage risk in the telecommunications industry They also formed a committee of principals to study standard terms and conditions needed to establish a liquid market for bandwidth trading People who attended the meeting said two of the largest carriers were missing at the CompTel meeting MCI WorldCom WCOM news msgs was there but ATT T news msgs and Sprint FON news msgs werent The meeting next week which starts Monday is for telecom carriers only Epps said This week he wouldnt mention names of the companies invited but last month he told Dow Jones Newswires his companys meeting would include the real players the MCI WorldComms the Qwests Q news msgs the ATTs Its about people who have the assets and how we use these to advantage the marketplace how we build a good powerful market model Epps said

to a friend By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesWhen I first started covering the electricity industry almost three years ago people told me to talk to Thomas McAndrew one of the original power marketers considered by many to be one of the best A nuclear engineer by training McAndrew left a job at a Southern Co nuclear power plant to get a masters degree in business from Harvard in He first traded at Enron Corp ENE news msgs and then moved to the Eastern Group the US unit of Statoil Norways state energy company Statoil exited the US power and gas industry late last year McAndrew and his trading team have been doing some consulting and trading on their own account since Feb They are looking to stay together and work for another firm Meanwhile without a corporate spokesman over his shoulder McAndrew was able to speak his mind about the troubled New York Mercantile Exchange electricity contract and power shortages expected this summer He also talked about the success of Enron at trading both profitably and online and the difficulty of doing both at the same time DJ Why have the New York Mercantile Exchanges electricity contracts not worked TM The Nymex clearly lost on electronic execution of trades because now you have Bloomberg Altra and EnronOnline With the Nymex I had to call get a quote the guy didnt even stand in the ring and maybe I would get two lots I could execute times as much overthecounter with half the effort They still think they have a monopoly on clearing trades They dont realize that there are at least four companies looking into it and my guess is that within six months one of them will have a solution Now the Nymex has nothing DJ They will begin trading electricity contracts strictly electronically not in the ring at all starting March Do you think that will revive the contract TM Not really The industry pretty clearly told the Nymex last fall that what we want is electronic execution with clearing of seasonal strips not just single months But the Nymex has had the attitude consistently that they know more than the industry Theyve treated the industry in a condescending way All you can trade is the months while theres a tremendous amount of volume being traded OTC on location spreads and strips I expect the best volumes ever in the next four months All it takes is the top guys to take of their business to the Nymex and they would see tremendous growth But the only way is to have strips available April at the latest If history is the judge they wont do it They should be embarrassed Theres a lot of interest within the Nymex not to launch strips because of what they would have to do with crude oil and natural gas Theyre an exchange run by the locals How can the Nymex succeed when EnronOnline supports cent twoway spreads in the front part of the curve Its hard to justify going to a market with cents between the bid and ask just to get clearing If the Nymex doesnt have a strip product in place by April theyre done DJ What do you think of Enrons online success TM If they continue to support it the way they are its good for the market If they support it for six months and then spin it off then thats not good DJ Are they that good at trading to continue to support cent spreads TM No Are they that much better than the market Theyre obviously very good traders but not that good I dont know many traders that can do that Obviously its a great story for them The goal of EnronOnline in the short term is to generate revenue not profits DJ Enron has maintained very good trading margins for years You used to work there How do they do it TM They hire really smart people and they have a solid infrastructure and great risk management Ive been an Enron shareholder for years and will continue to be I just bought some more They are the blue chip of the new energy business risk management and now broadband Do they do everything right No but when they do something wrong they contain it and correct it They know when to ride their winners and when to cut their losses DJ Are the California Power Exchange and other pools inflating wholesale electricity prices in their states TM Theres a fundamental reason for prices going up tremendous increase in load growth without a corresponding increase in generation Realistically we should be trading in the West at the levels of PJM the PennsylvaniaNew JerseyMaryland pool but because of regulatory uncertainty were not Whats the price cap going to be this summer Nobody knows I think the California Independent System Operator is getting ready to find out about the law of unintended consequences The price cap in place is a disincentive to building generators which will lead to a shortage of power and higher prices In the rest of the country metal is going into the ground and theyre squeezing every megawatt out of existing plants There are a limited number of turbines If you went to General Electric right now youd have to wait four years for a gas turbine Where are the people that have them going to install them In California with price caps Probably not Look at the price of a fiveyear summer strip at Cinergy Youre going to put the turbines in the Midwest Even if you have to pay cents more for gas who cares You dont make prices go down by putting in price caps You make prices go down by adding supply faster than demand growth

Rieke HOUSTON Dow JonesWashington DC entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on a boom in bandwidth trading His company LighTrade Inc will spend million million this year to install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth or space on telecom lines in Atlanta Chicago Denver Dallas Miami San Francisco San Jose Seattle and Washington DC Bandwidth trading is growing driven by increased demand by businesses for the Internet In a report released last December CIBC World Markets estimated that of total bandwidth traffic or billion in revenues could be traded in some manner within five years Last week Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc WCG news msgs announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites known as pooling points Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires The points connect telecommunications carriers allowing data to move from one network to another They are installed in telecom hotels buildings that house carrier facilities and essentially consist of a Lucent Technologies Inc LU news msgs bandwidth manager about the size of a tall narrow refrigerator Enron Broadband Services a unit of Enron Corp ENE news msgs established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles It plans to build another in London this year Last year Enron Corp proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized contract It executed the first trade under the contract in December buying space on a monthly basis on a New YorkLos Angeles line from Global Crossing Ltd of Bermuda Forrester Research Inc a Cambridge Massbased technology research firm has charged that Enrons ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in bandwidth trades Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the bandwidth trading market get off the ground said Stephen Kamman a telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets Its a very positive development for the bandwidth trading market said Tom Gros vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for the open trading of bandwidth Gros said The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for years Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate Companies must start from scratch with each deal negotiating price quantity length of contract and quality of service In the past deals have been longterm sometimes as long as years But with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining a year such terms are less attractive Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth trading organization an independent body that will decide on standard terms and conditions for trading Two groups in London and one in the United States are vying to form such a group LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic Pierson said Longrange plans call for the company to have sites in the US cities that develop the most traffic But the companys pace building a network of points will depend on how quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading bandwidth as a commodity LighTrade wants to install points in Boston Houston Las Vegas Memphis and Phoenix in Pierson said It is eyeing a move into international markets as early as next year if the market will support it Western Europe is a likely starting point with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites Eventually LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo and Osaka The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its bandwidth managers LighTrade has another connection to the hightech company William Plunkett a senior vice president at Lucent is on LighTrades board of directors Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would invest in his company LighTrade isnt Piersons first startup company The telecommunications attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom ARTT news msgs a NASDAQtraded company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks That company now has market capitalization of million Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three major telecommunications carriers he said He wouldnt identify the companies He said he doesnt know of any competitors building pooling points but he expects others to enter the market He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop pooling points because they dont know how quickly the market will develop he said But I wouldnt be in it if I did not think this would be a very significant economic return Pierson said By Michael Rieke

friend By Michael Rieke HOUSTON Dow JonesWilliams Communications Group Inc WCG news msgs has formed a bandwidth trading group in a step toward embracing standardized bandwidth trading The company was initially opposed to the idea of bandwidth trading as a commodity under standard terms and conditions so its change of opinion is being viewed by analysts as a key step toward creating a commodity market for telecommunications bandwidth Williams Communications now wants to be a leader in setting industry standards for bandwidth trading Gordon Martin president of Williams Communications carrier services told Dow Jones Newswires The company plans to draw on the commodity trading experience of Williams Co WMB news msgs Martin said Williams Co an energy company that owns of Williams Communications has been trading energy commodities such as natural gas for years Williams Communications has named Sharon Crow as vice president of bandwidth risk and optimization management She was previously a gas trader and risk manager with Williams Energy Services a unit of Williams Co Williams Communications has one of the largest interstate telecommunications networks in the United States It has recently been adding more telecommunications fiber on both the local and international level Martin said This is a market that may not be at a maturity level that others would like to think it is in terms of ability to trade Martin said Thats a clear reference to Enron Corp which proposed last year that bandwidth be traded as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Enron did the first such trade in December agreeing to buy DS bandwidth from New York and Los Angeles in monthly increments from Global Crossing Ltd GBLX news msgs A DS fiber moves data at a rate of megabits per second Tom Gros vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron said he welcomes Williams to the bandwidth trading market This is something that enables all of us to more effectively manage our bandwidth and offer more innovative solutions to our clients Williams Communications Martin is quick to point out that his company has been trading bandwidth for about years Those deals have typically been long term as long as to years Traditional bandwidth deals take weeks or even months to close as companies negotiate quantity price quality of service creditworthiness damages for nonperformance and other issues Each new deal would start again from scratch to negotiate those issues By setting standard terms and conditions to cover such issues industry players can trade bandwidth more quickly and more efficiently Crow said The resulting liquidity will add flexibility to the telecommunications industry allowing producers and users of bandwidth to manage risk Crow said Williams Communications wants to take the lead in forming a telecommunications industry committee to standardize terms for bandwidth trading Thats an aboutface for Williams Communications Last May a company official was quoted as saying that bandwidth couldnt trade as a commodity under standard terms and conditions Last December another company official spoke at a bandwidth trading conference in New York City He was still skeptical but softened the companys opposition to the idea Crow said Williams Communications and Williams Co have had a committee studying the bandwidth trading idea for more than a year The group was looking at the issue from a timing perspective to see how long it would take to become liquid Now Williams Communications wants to help spur that liquidity Part of Williams Communications change of opinion has had to do with the evolution of Enrons trading proposal It was originally seen by Williams as a proposal to trade minutes of long distance telephony minutes said a Williams official who didnt want to be identified Later it evolved into trading of highspeed data transmission bandwidth Its also become evident this year that the stock market likes the bandwidth trading idea Before Enron did its first bandwidth trade in early December its share price was less than a share Then mutual funds came in to buy large blocks of stock in December pushing the share price above the mark The share price got another shot in the arm when Enron played up bandwidth trading and its fiberoptic network at its analysts meeting Jan On Jan Enrons stock closed at a share On the day of the analysts meeting it closed at The next day it closed at The markets reaction to Enrons bandwidth position did invigorate our examination of the issue said the Williams Communication official The market had shown a willingness to reward the kind of capability we believe we had but that we hadnt brought this kind of focus to he said All the Williams Communications officials stressed that a liquid market in bandwidth would enable the company to manage risk for itself and for its customers Under the traditional longterm deals a bandwidth consumer has to buy enough bandwidth to handle its maximum needs It continues to pay for all the bandwidth even if its using only part of it at times A liquid market would allow a consumer to more closely match its bandwidth purchases with its needs Williams hopes to be pushing liquidity in certain aspects of trading like monthly deals instead of only multiyear deals said a company official The more bandwidth trades the more buyers and sellers learn about the value of individual telecommunications products he said Crow said the company is still working on an action plan to put together its trading group It could draft employees from the Williams Communications longterm trading and deal organization group the Williams Co energy commodity trading group and from outside the company As for organizing an industry group to set standards for bandwidth trading she said that could be as simple as calling other telecommunication carriers

todays Motley Fool Bill Mann was at the briefing yesterday Im fairly certain well see something in todays CommDaily as well then theres the weeklies and monthlies who were there and will be coming on stream Ill keep you posted Terry FOOL ON THE HILL An Investment Opinion Enrons Telecommunications Revolution By Bill Mann Aboutstaffbillmhtm TMF Otter February Heres a juicy piece of trivia for you Can you name the company with the largest amount of business derived from ecommerce If you managed to see the title youd likely expect the answer to be Enron And youd be right Houstonbased Enron Corp NYSE ENE uberdataaspsymbolsENE processes online transactions with a notional value of million per day Enrons electricity and natural gas intermediation services manage a significant portion of the natural gas spot contracts in the United States and Canada providing service via its own natural gas pipeline network as well as providing the information system to broker sales between suppliers and purchasers In effect Enron has decided to leverage its network of pipelines by using the information about natural gas flow to help make a much more efficient system The information is then what becomes valuable with the network and the actual natural gas just being the commodity upon which the information exchange is built Enron has made some recent splashes here at The Motley Fool starting with its inclusion as a NOW Index nownowhtm company which began on the first day of trading in In just the last two weeks Enrons CEO Ken Lay appeared with Tom and David Gardner on The Motley Fool Radio Show radioradioonlinehtm and on Monday of this week George Runkle TMF Runkle wrote about it as a part of the Pathfinder Series dripportdripporthtm being undertaken in the Drip Port But what really catches my eye about Enron is its attempt to bring the same spot market efficiency to the bandwidth market as it has done with natural gas This is something really bold a company with natural gas and electric utility backgrounds Enron owns Portland General Electric the incumbent utility in northwestern Oregon moving into the telecommunications field one of the most fiercely competitive on the planet Are these people nuts Not at all Theyre crazy like foxes actually Enron is part of a rare breed a company that is perfectly willing to go out and compete for business anywhere anytime They seem to have no preconceived notions of what their business limitations are supposed to be and have never seen any such thing as a sacred cow to the point of selling off the operations that first brought them into commerce These companies to which I assign the highest regard include Nokia NYSE NOK uberdataaspsymbolsNOK CMGi Nasdaq CMGI uberdataaspsymbolsCMGI Reed Elsevier NYSE ENL uberdataaspsymbolsENL Cable Wireless NYSE CWP uberdataaspsymbolsCWP and Schlumberger NYSE SLB uberdataaspsymbolsSLB operate in different industries but they are in effect companies that trade primarily in intellectual capital Enron fits this mold as well it trades in information the commodities and services it provides are the manifestations of that information With this background in mind I jumped at the opportunity this morning to attend an informational session that Enron held in Washington DC to discuss its new initiative Enron Broadband Services presented by the CEO of EBS Joe Hirko and the Vice President of Bandwidth Trading Tom Gros What Enron proposes to do and is provisioning its network for is to create a market by which Internet Service Providers ISPs carriers brokers and end users can purchase high bandwidth capacity on a spot market Enron is initially using its existing mile fiber optic network in the US along with pooling points and other points of presence currently in US cities The concept is revolutionary Currently highbandwidth pipelines DS and higher are provisioned on a longterm contract basis and can take up to days to be brought into service This means that it is very difficult for networks to do any dynamic load management because their networks must be built to handle peak usage times that in some instances can be times as high as the low usage points Enron estimates as a result of this that even on the heaviest trafficked routes such as New YorkLos Angeles that the load factor amount of capacity that is actually used for circuits is less than What Enron is proposing would provide a way for network managers to use as much bandwidth as they need during peak times and sell it on the open market during their own lower traffic times But how can companies do this given the long lead times required to bring up and tear down circuits Enter Enron Enron has built its first two pooling points one in New York one in Los Angeles to which ISPs carriers and highdensity end users can connect These pooling points can then using Enrons network optimization protocols route the traffic from any number of customers across the same network In so doing Enron has provided its customers a solution that would otherwise be unavailable to them the ability to efficiently provision their own bandwidth needs on a timeofday hourly or onetime purchase basis So for example if Citigroup NYSE C uberdataaspsymbolsC needed to send wiring information out from its New York clearinghouse once a day from am Enron could provide them dedicated bandwidth for that transaction selling the capacity to other clients during the other hours of the day Enron can even hot roll a data stream matching supply and demand every seconds and move a customer from one dedicated circuit to another without any disruption of service to the customer There is a great deal of things that need to take place in the market before this vision becomes real such as terms of service standards legal efficiency master contracts and an increased level of interconnectivity between carriers But more importantly carriers need to be willing to change the rules of the game At least one carrier has been dismissive of Enrons entrance into their sandbox saying that theres nothing an Enron could teach them about their own business This suits Joe Hirko just fine as Enron is working to set up a liquid telecommunications market and in the end like anything else the needs of the consumers will drive the market Hirko expects that activity in a liquid bandwidth market will build through But already Enron Communications has some million in streaming contracts Seeing as Akamai Nasdaq AKAM uberdataaspsymbolsAKAM whose Internet delivery service provides network flexibility is valued at billion for million in annual sales is it any wonder why some analysts believe that Enron Communications could be worth more than all of the rest of the company If Enron succeeds in its drive to create an open broadband market its billion market cap could be a distant memory Be sure to check out our Valentines Day treat Stocks Fools Love specialsspsflhtm for a few

Bandwidth Trading Description Is Latest Fiber Optic Play Enron Detail Dow Jones News Service Investors cant get enough fiber And were not talking about a bowl of Cheerios or Special K Were talking about fiber optics Telecommunications companies such as Qwest Communications QWST Global Crossing GBLX and Level Communications LVLT are racing to build new fiberoptic networks so that highbandwidth applications like video can travel faster and be clearer when they reach the desktop The huge growth of the Internet has increased the need for more capacity on old fiber and copper wire networks All sorts of new switches routers servers and software are being used to build the new networks and beef up the old ones The need for fiber and gadgets that enhance networks prompted Corning GLW that erstwhile dishmaker to announce Thursday that it will spend million to increase its fiberoptics manufacturing capacity by over the next few years And the trend has sent stocks like JDS Uniphase JDSU SDL SDLI and Sycamore Networks SCMR through the roof The excitement over fiber optics and increasing bandwidth is also juicing up shares of an old natural gas and electric company called Enron ENE True Enron isnt a typical energy or utility company The Houstonbased company is known for leading the charge of wholesale marketing and trading of gas and electricity But Enron has never been considered a telecommunications company Until now After trading between and last year Enron shares shot up to a new high of last month after the company held its annual analysts conference where it unveiled its new communications strategy and a surprising joint venture with Sun Microsystems SUNW Wall Street was smitten Although this is still an energy company in our view Enron fits the description of a new economy stock because it has moved its wholesale trading operations online and announced a unique broadband strategy wrote Donato Eassey a Wall Street Journal AllStar analyst at Merrill Lynch Enron has been building its broadband business since when it acquired Portland General Electric which started building a fiberoptic network Enron invited both telecom analysts and the usual contingent of natural gas analysts to its Jan meeting The company presented its new network which is based on fiber servers that are ramps on and off the network pooling points which are essentially switches that connect its network to other networks and software to control the transmission of data The company is using networking gear mostly from Lucent Technology LU and Cisco Systems CSCO By the end of Enron expects to increase its network to miles from about miles now a sizeable slice of the roughly miles of fiber in the US The company also announced a joint venture with Sun Microsystems to develop a standard technology for accessing realtime bandwidth and supply Enron with servers With Sun CEO Scott McNealy at their side Enron executives said Sun will purchase broadband video streaming services from Enron All we can say is WOW wrote Edward Tirello Jr at Deutsche Bank Alex Brown in a note after the show Just when we began to ponder the potential with a very healthy skepticism Enron brilliantly anticipated the reaction and thrust Sun Microsystems billionaire CEO Scott McNealy into the mix Fund managers have been intrigued by Enrons transformation too Back in December the Janus Fund JANSX snapped up million shares of Enron bringing its stake to more than million shares and making it by far the largest holder of the stock according to the latest monthly data from Morningstar And Fidelitys huge Magellan FMAGX fund nearly doubled its stake in Enron to million shares in December Says Marion Schultheis managing director at J W Seligman who owns the stock in two growth funds and is looking to buy more Now there are real tech people looking at Enron Analysts think Enrons stock can climb even higher In January it was just the first step of the market realizing what this company is doing says Erik Ruben an analyst at Janus Capital It is such an extraordinary story Wall Street Journal AllStar analyst Rick Gross at Lehman Brothers agrees The natural gas analyst is quick to point out that the stock is also reflecting strength in Enrons wholesale gas and electric business and the companys success in turning its energy services business profitable for the first time in the fourth quarter Enron plans to use its network in two ways The first business is bandwidth intermediation which involves using its own network and other networks to provide businesses and Internet service providers with full bandwidth needs Enron aims to lower the cost of using networks by charging customers for only the time and space they use on the network Right now customers that need space on a network have to enter longterm contracts for preset amounts of capacity with major telecommunications providers such as ATT T and MCI WorldCom WCOM Enron has also developed a standard bandwidth contract that pools existing contracts or unused capacity that can be traded in a marketplace see story for more Basically the company plans to make money on the spread

Ronald Barone at PaineWebber figures that the bandwidth intermediation business will generate gross operating income of more than million in from an estimated million this year The second business is providing broadband content services such as video conferencing and streaming The company is using its own messaging software acquired from a company called Modulus along with Inktomi INKT caching software to control distribution of content across its network and RealNetworks RWNK video streaming software It is also using switch routers that control data flows made by a privately held company called Avici Systems The company expects to generate content revenue of billion in up from an estimated million this year according to Barone The whole broadband services unit is expected to spend million and lose million before interest and taxes this year Barone says But right now the stock is hardly reflecting this business says Lehmans Gross The nonbroadband business is valued at to so

strategy is catching a lot of attention but some of the established telecom companies such as MCI WorldCom WCOM doubt that it will be successful Still Global Crossing which was the first to sell bandwidth between New York and Los Angeles to Enron in December has indicated that it thinks the bandwidth trading concept can work Its just a question of when Enron is going to be a winner in bandwidth trading agrees Brad Bradshaw senior director at the Yankee Group Its going to take a while though Even if the broadband plans dont work out Enron has a thriving energy business to fall back on The company owns gas pipelines sells wholesale gas and electricity in North America both traditionally and online and manages energy needs for large companies such as Chase Manhattan CMB and Simon

Jones Enron Corp ENE is currently testing hardware and software in order to start trading telecommunications bandwidth capacity early next month The installations in New York City and Los Angeles are key steps in a pioneering proposal that could create a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year Tom Gros Enron Communications vice president of global bandwidth trading told Dow Jones Newswires Enron has proposed trading Time Division Multiplexing or TDM and Internet Protocol or IP bandwidth TDM is used mostly for voice transmission and IP is used mostly for data transmission In nontechnical terms TDM and IP have been compared to two different systems for moving commuters TDM is comparable to a rail system moving commuters by train with only one train at a time moving on the track between two points IP is comparable to commuters moving in smaller groups in several cars between the same two points The route between those two points can be used by other commuters or other data at the same time In other words TDM sends one signal at a time between two points IP breaks a single transmission of data into packets of data moves them to another point where they are reassembled into one message With IP packets of many separate data transmissions can be sent simultaneously over a path Trading of TDM bandwidth will start in December and trading of IP will start early next year Gros said Trading will begin with TDM because its a more liquid market Three types of TDM bandwidth will trade DS OC and OC DS moves about million bits per second OC moves Mbps and OC moves Mbps Enrons proposal would establish a master agreement covering quality specifications and the delivery mechanism for trading bandwidth as a commodity After companies sign that agreement all their trades would be covered by it Individual deals could then be negotiated over the phone to cover price time period segment and quantity in a few minutes Gros said The standard terms and conditions Enron has come up with should make deals happen more quickly said Amanda McCarthy an analyst for Forrester Research a technology research company Each deals contract would be confirmed the same day by facsimile or electronic communication between the buyer and seller They would be unregulated overthecounter transactions If a company fails to make or take delivery according to the deal specifications it would be subject to liquidated damages By installing the hardware and software needed for trading Enron will become the first pooling point developer called for in its proposal The hardware and software will establish connections with other carriers enabling trades of TDM bandwidth capacity between New York and Los Angeles The path between New York and Los Angeles is the most liquid in North America Gros said Its also an excellent launching point to connect with European and Asian markets Because that path is volatile it will motivate industry players to mitigate price risk and will give speculators trading opportunities according to Enrons proposal Developers will build up to other pooling points in North American cities in the next months Gros said Those pooling points will allow bandwidth between other pairs of cities to trade under the standard terms and conditions As many as more pooling points will be built outside of North America particularly in Western Europe and the Pacific Rim creating a global market for bandwidth he said Enron Chairman Ken Lay said recently that bandwidth would be trading under Enrons proposal in Europe by the first half of next year and in Asia by the second half of next year Enron is willing to build all the pooling points at a cost of a few million dollars each Gros said But other companies also are interested in being pooling point developers Once we build the first two and prove the concept were looking forward to pretty healthy competition for people who want to be pooling point developers Having Enron own any of the pooling points is a problem said Forresters McCarthy Enron is not a disinterested party It has its own network and it owns hubs so a company like ATT wont fully participate in that market The idea of a neutral third party is important she said Gros said Enron has addressed that potential problem with the concept of a pooling point administrator or PPA The PPA a neutral third party would help to arrange physical delivery of the bandwidth The PPA and both parties to the trade would monitor quality of service and other terms of the deal as it runs its course Enron is talking to PricewaterhouseCoopers about being the pooling point administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers already has been working with Enron for months to develop the role of the pooling point administrator Pooling point developers will have to build to meet specifications of the bandwidth trading organization or BTO Gros said The bandwidth trading organization will be made up of traders in industry and will be authorized to approve pooling point developers and the pooling point administrator We hope thatby the end of the first quarter of we will have the founding members of the trading organization Gros said Thats not a firm date but a reasonable time frame The BTO wasnt part of the original trading proposal Enron released in May It was added recently to help allay any fears about Enron or any other company developing and owning pooling points Some skeptics doubt there will be a rush to sign up for the BTO or to accept Enrons proposal for trading They cite what they call a poor turnout at Enrons industry summit in September in California Gros wouldnt name specific companies that attended the meeting He said only that it was attended by telecommunications carrier firms that have significant physical capacity in the Pacific Atlantic and North American segments There were also hardware firms and a couple of consulting firms represented An attendee who didnt want to be identified said only two carriers attended Global Crossing Ltd and Williams Communications Group They were having a tough time with the proposal he said Gros said Enron had the turnout it expected Attendance was limited purposely so the meeting would be a roundtable discussion We turned away dozens who had asked to come Gros said He isnt bothered by skeptics Enron encountered skeptics when US natural gas and electric power markets were commoditized in the last two decades he said The company worked to establish both of those markets and now it is the largest player in each of them It also plans to be a firstmover in the bandwidth market When trading starts in December Enron will be a marketmaker buying or selling as needed to get the market moving Gros said And he wont be discouraged if the market doesnt grow quickly The commodity market for gas and power each took off slowly he said Instead he continues to promote the benefits of a bandwidth commodity market Even if you dont own any physical capacity it will be so easy for you ina couple of phone calls to effectively nail up a national or possibly international telecommunications grid If the market develops as Enron has predicted it could prevent major headaches for telecommunications carriers and their customers When Uunet a unit of MCI Worldcom Inc WCOM had a system problem recently the Chicago Board of Trade one of its customers lost its online trading system for a few days If bandwidth had been trading as a commodity when MCI had its problems last month it would have given the company a range of choices to solve the problem said Forresters McCarthy Gros agreed A realtime market in bandwidth could develop If that market had existed when Uunet had its problem the CBOT would have been able to get its online trading system back up in a matter of minutes or hours he said By Michael Rieke Dow Jones Newswires
