business school hit home for many Weekly Career Update readers Heres what some o f you had to say To see the original article The BSchool Decision go here I just wanted to point out that there are a few aspects of se eking an MBA that you neglected to mention in your BSchool Decision art icle I am a year IT veteran who returned to school to obtain an MBA i n Technology Management from The University of Phoenix Online in I took a one year break for the birth of each of my two dughters but am fin ally about to finish Ive been around long enough to know that an MBA is not an instant ticket to fame and fortune but I also know that an MBA can pay off even if you arent planning to look for a new job as soon as you graduate First employers are often highly supportive of employees wh o wish to return to school to obtain advanced degrees Many employers wil l pay anywhere from half of tuition up to the entire amount of the degree plus books and lab fees With incentives like that the FIRST place you should look in financing a degree is with your current employer Some em ployers seek a contractual obligation that you will stay with them after y ou graduate but even with this clause if you are set on leaving you shou ld still be able to leverage a better salary or position for the stay An other option would be to negotiate with your prospective employer to pay p art of the obligation to your past employer Its a long shot but worth a try Another thing you neglected to mention is that many schools now h ave programs that are geared to adult fulltime employees I chose the University of Pheonix specifically for this reason Class in the evening or better yet online allow the student to return to school with a minim al impact on work Sure an online degree is not an MBA from Harvard yet but an MBA from a school like UOPHX is still an MBA and unlike the smal l college down the street UOPHX is pumping out enough MBA graduates on a national level to at least be recognized by employers And lastly whe n considering whether to obtain an MBA you have to consider the cost of N OT pursueing one As you get older credentials are not as important as e xperience but most employers have bought into the idea that learning is a lifelong activity and they look favorably on anyone who demonstrates that they want to keep learning regardless of their age or position And the percentage of employees who are seeking some kind of certification or deg ree is increasing all the time The truth is if you are not making some e ffort to continue your education in some form chances are you are at a di sadvantage to those who are when promotion time comes I thought that the MBA article made a good point dont go back to school simply to hide out The article however failed higher education in a major way b y mostly presenting a short term cost benefit analysis The most important benefit of a graduate level education is the development of the cognitive a bilities of the student This accomplishment is opens then mind last a lif e time and can positively affect many generations within the graduates fa mily While financial factors are reality and should be considered caref ully they should not be the primary deciding factor when determining wheth er or not to obtain a graduate degree I hope that you did not discourage t oo many people with your article I enjoyed your article on making t he B school decision I was one that decided not to do it several years ag o Mainly because I did not see where the curriculum really prepared you f or practicing management in the real world My undergraduate degree was i n Business Administration More importantly proven experience almost al ways out weighs the MBA I consistently volunteered for projects at work a nd always tried to continuously improve myself and the organization This led to me becoming a Vice President by age My recommendation is if yo u need the knowledge of how businesses work look into an MBA but realize p racticing management is much more powerful than studying it An MBA will n ot teach taking risk overcoming adversity resiliency and making decisions that has powerful impacts on people Those can only be learned through th e school of hard knocks Regards Paul IMAGE IMAGE IMAG E Advertisement IMAGE IMAGE ADVERTISE IMAGE At Capella Universit y you can earn your Masters in Human Resource

readers wrote in to point out that our article on MBA degrees last week failed to mention th e decision to get an online degree Hence we bring you the results of a V ault survey on employer perceptions of an online education Vault surveye d HR professionals on their opinions regarding candidates with online d egrees The following are the results from the survey of HR prof essionals or hiring managers have encountered applicants with online degree s Selected quotes The candidates that Ive spoken with seem to be se lfdependent eager and very abreast of the latest technologically I s till view this as close to the equivalent of earning a GED through a Sally Struthers correspondence course There may be some value to online degr ees but in order for them to be truly worthwhile they need to overcome th e stigma of being just another degree mill or correspondence course adver tising on matchbooks I usually like these candidates more than those f rom traditional universities most of them have been working in the indust ry and have some years of experience and accomplishments to their credit of HR professionals or hiring managers believe that an online degree e arned at an accredited institution Duke Stanford is more credible than o ne earned at an Internet only institution Jones International Do you w ish to read more But of course you do Get thee hence to Vault now
