<5239328.1075843676395.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.etringer@enron.com,2001-05-03 04:50:00,Proposal for QF Contract Restructure Cc I had a good discussion with Milton Schultz GM of Burney Forest Products Milton indicated they have years left on a PPA SO with PGE Their plant provides MW of peak generation with firm capacity on MWs and as available on volumes above MW which Milton indicated has the flexibility to be turned down on off peak hours In addition their fuel costs are a function of demand and if they were able to fill the energy from the market it would likely lower the overall cost of fuel wood chips The economics of the deal for ENA appear to be good enough for ENA to be able to pay a decent option premium up front which could be structured as partial relief of the PGE receivable Milton indicated that the PGE receivable is approx Below is the email I sent Milton and an attached outline sheet Milton indicated the he would discuss the idea with Rich Purcell apparently a main partner in the project He seemed to be genuinely interested and felt it was something Rich would also like The question is Can we facilitate through the QFs a contract restructuring with PGE and if so what steps would we propose at this point assuming I get interest back from Burney Forest Products I would propose that ENA work with the QF to structure the terms of the restructed PPA between the QF and PGE and that simultaneous with that agreement ENA enter into a long term services deal to supply the market based energy as well as provide for an upfron option premium for the right to put market based power to the QFutility Let me know your thoughts Mike Forwarded by Michael EtringerHOUECT on PM Michael Etringer PM To cc Chris H nronXGate Subject Proposal for QF Contract Restructure Milton I very much enjoyed talking with you today As we discussed please find attached a general discussion outline for the QF restructuring proposal I hope this gives a fair assessment of the proposal but as usual words are always subject to interpretation so I would look forward to discussing these ideas in greater detail Although the landscape is currently a mess at best I do believe it provides some unique opportunities to explore alternative solutions to the current energy crisis As I indicated Enron would be very interested in working with a QF or group of QFs to explore and develop an approach which the QFs can take to the utilities and potentially the PUC and bankruptcy courts Look forward to talking with you and Rich after youve had a chance to further consider the proposal Thanks again for your time Sincerely Mike Etringer West Power Origination
