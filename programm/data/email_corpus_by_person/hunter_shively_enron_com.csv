SteffesNAEnron on AM Susan M Landwehr AM To James D nron cc Harry nron Janine nron Roy ES Subject Crains January Jimplease take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains magazine tomorrow Youll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debatethe ENA Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan The articles and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks point out that Peoples is in hot water politicallyI would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool On the other hand if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate this could be the time to make the playwhile the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not Id appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICCI have not heard back from her but Roy may have Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call Forwarded by Susan M LandwehrNAEnron on AM Fein David I CHI PM To cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains January Sue Roy We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest To solve gas bill crisis turn heat up on Peoples Crains Editorial January Considering the fingerpointing thats going on between politicians regulators and Peoples Energy Corp executives one thing is becoming obvious Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices is much simpler than fixing the problem Nonetheless all of these factions bear some responsibility for this winters monthly home heating bills which for many residents are soaring by hundreds of dollars over last winters tabs Each of these groups should be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to blunt future price spikes Make no mistake about it this crisis will not melt away with the spring thaw Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just snap your fingers and it happens David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle

SteffesNAEnron on AM Susan M Landwehr AM To James D nron cc Harry nron Janine nron Roy ES Subject Crains January Jimplease take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains magazine tomorrow Youll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debatethe ENA Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan The articles and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks point out that Peoples is in hot water politicallyI would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool On the other hand if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate this could be the time to make the playwhile the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not Id appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICCI have not heard back from her but Roy may have Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call Forwarded by Susan M LandwehrNAEnron on AM Fein David I CHI PM To cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains January Sue Roy We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest To solve gas bill crisis turn heat up on Peoples Crains Editorial January Considering the fingerpointing thats going on between politicians regulators and Peoples Energy Corp executives one thing is becoming obvious Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices is much simpler than fixing the problem Nonetheless all of these factions bear some responsibility for this winters monthly home heating bills which for many residents are soaring by hundreds of dollars over last winters tabs Each of these groups should be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to blunt future price spikes Make no mistake about it this crisis will not melt away with the spring thaw Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just snap your fingers and it happens David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle

SteffesNAEnron on AM Susan M Landwehr AM To James D nron cc Harry nron Janine nron Roy ES Subject Crains January Jimplease take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains magazine tomorrow Youll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debatethe ENA Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan The articles and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks point out that Peoples is in hot water politicallyI would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool On the other hand if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate this could be the time to make the playwhile the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not Id appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICCI have not heard back from her but Roy may have Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call Forwarded by Susan M LandwehrNAEnron on AM Fein David I CHI PM To cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains January Sue Roy We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest To solve gas bill crisis turn heat up on Peoples Crains Editorial January Considering the fingerpointing thats going on between politicians regulators and Peoples Energy Corp executives one thing is becoming obvious Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices is much simpler than fixing the problem Nonetheless all of these factions bear some responsibility for this winters monthly home heating bills which for many residents are soaring by hundreds of dollars over last winters tabs Each of these groups should be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to blunt future price spikes Make no mistake about it this crisis will not melt away with the spring thaw Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just snap your fingers and it happens David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle

tomorrow Youll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debatethe ENA Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan The articles and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks point out that Peoples is in hot water politicallyI would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool On the other hand if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate this could be the time to make the playwhile the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not Id appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICCI have not heard back from her but Roy may have Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call Forwarded by Susan M LandwehrNAEnron on AM Fein David I CHI PM To cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains January Sue Roy We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest To solve gas bill crisis turn heat up on Peoples Crains Editorial January Considering the fingerpointing thats going on between politicians regulators and Peoples Energy Corp executives one thing is becoming obvious Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices is much simpler than fixing the problem Nonetheless all of these factions bear some responsibility for this winters monthly home heating bills which for many residents are soaring by hundreds of dollars over last winters tabs Each of these groups should be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to blunt future price spikes Make no mistake about it this crisis will not melt away with the spring thaw Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just snap your fingers and it happens David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle
