Mari Hayes To CC Subject letter about Afghanistan worth reading Date Sat Sep Im forwarding this as it expresses a lot of my sentiment and I truly feel any kind of major military attack will open pandoras box or a wasp nest if you like and the results will be disasterous To have thousands more innocent people die is also an act of terrorism it IS TIME to see where all the hate comes from and clean up our own backyard children have died in Iraq because of the sanctions Afghanistan exists in the stone ageyes the Palestinians have committed acts of terror against the Israelis but the Israelis have also terrorized the Palestinians YES those that backed the crimes should be brought to justice but NOT at the cost of a lot more innocent livestime to use some of their own tricks instead of going in with the heavy artillery which kills indiscriminately Hello all I thought you might want to read this obviously heartfelt letter that was forwarded to me from an American that grew up in Afghanistan I think the perspective is an interesting one and perhaps one that few of us have access to Anne Sofia Dear Friends Yesterday I heard a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage and he asked What else can we do What is your suggestion Minutes later I heard a TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done I thought about these issues especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for years Ive never lost track of whats been going on over there So I want to share a few thoughts with anyone who will listen I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I fervently wish to see those monsters punished But the Taliban and Ben Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who captured Afghanistan in and have been holding the country in bondage ever since Bin Laden is a political criminal with a master plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would love for someone to eliminate the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country I guarantee it Some say if thats the case why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban themselves The answer is theyre starved exhausted damaged and incapacitated A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are disabled orphans in Afghanistana country with no economy no food Millions of Afghans are widows of the approximately two million men killed during the war with the Soviets And the Taliban has been executing these women for being women and have buried some of their opponents alive in mass graves The soil of Afghanistan is littered with land mines and almost all the farms have been destroyed The Afghan people have tried to overthrow the Taliban They havent been able to We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble with that scheme is its already been done The Soviets took care of it Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure There is no infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only land in the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide They have already I hear Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would be making common cause with the Talibanby raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops I think that when people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done many of them are thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed They are thinking about overcoming moral qualms about killing innocent people But its the belly to die not kill thats actually on the table Americans will die in a land war to get Bin Laden And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks To get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going The invasion approach is a flirtation with global war between Islam and the West And that is Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants and why he did this thing Read his speeches and statements Its all right there AT the moment of course Islam as such does not exist There are Muslims and there are Muslim countries but no such political entity as Islam Bin Laden believes that if he can get a war started he can constitute this entity and hed be running it He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the West wreaks a holocaust in Muslim lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong about winning in the end the west would probably overcomewhatever that would mean in such a war but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden yes but anyone else I dont have a solution But I do believe that suffering and poverty are the soil in which terrorism grows Bin Laden and his cohorts want to bait us into creating more such soil so they and their kind can flourish We cant let him do that Thats my humble opinion Tamim Ansary Get your FREE download of

Palau It seems better to just move our Hawaii tickets to another date and purchase new tix flying out of Seattle That would be total airline price for the wedding I dont know if youd like to stay at the Manta Bay hotel because you may not like scubadiving with the big manta rays Up to you She said she send us more info on Yap to be arriving in the mail shortly so we can make a decision about that I still like Carolines best for the first week and the wedding ceremony Let me know so we can reserve or what ever love you From Annie Taylor To Crystal Burreson Subject RE Palau Date Wed Oct Crystal Thanks for your email Im sorry about the Hawaii airline tickets its an oversight that allot of clients make I think your decision to use those tickets at a later date is a good one in the long run It makes sense The airfare from Seattle Palau Seattle is per person only about more pp Let me know if this appeals to you and I will rebook your flights and fax you a copy The couple that just returned stayed at Carolines Resort in Palau and Manta Ray Bay Yap divers They had a wonderful time They liked the remoteness of Carolines and they liked the staff at the Manta Ray hotel as well as the manta encounters there They are both divers Hope this information is helpful Let me know about the airline reservations Thanks Anne Original Message From Crystal Burreson mailto Sent Tuesday October PM To Subject RE Palau Anne So weve discussed it further and we dont want my mistake of ordering the cheaper Honolulu tickets to prohibit us from going to Palau to get married Would the cost to fly from Seattle to Palau and back be the same as flying out of LA We could take the train up then from Portland to Seattle and it would be much easier We are thinking two things a if the trip from Seattle to Palau is about the same as the Honolulu to Palua plus the Portland to Honolulu tickets combined then well just use the tix I already purchased and purchase the remainder of the flight to Palau or b if the Seattle to Palau tix are the same price as LA to Palau then we will just buy those and use our Hawaii tix some other time and pay the date change price of per person Does that make any sense Either way we still want to go to Palau to get married and possible Yap after we review the materials you are sending I know Im taking a lot of time to make a decision but we have had a bunch of changes lately in our worklife and its been hard to make a solid decision until now So please get back to me when you can about the tix price from Seattle March st th Thank you so much Anne Crystal PS You said a couple you booked for recently came back from Palau and Yap and had a fabulous time What hotels did they stay at Are they divers Im curious to get the inside couples view on what to do and where to stay From Annie Taylor To Crystal Burreson Subject RE Palau Date Tue Oct Hi Crystal Geir Ill send you some information rates and brochures on the Yap properties You can do a night extension and dive days its a lovely quite island with tons of culture and warm people I liked it a lot its an amazing place Their are flights between Yap Palau times a week In regards to the airline flights Our contracts and most agencies do not allow for departures outside the mainland US so it wouldnt apply to Hawaii You can purchase a retail fare from Honolulu to Micronesia Palau Yap etc but the airfare is very high I wish you would have contacted me before purchasing that ticket as I would have given you the scoop The fare from Honolulu is pp plus tax So you see its not any savings doing it that way I understand not wanting to go through LAX but we could have maybe looked at the Seattle departure to make it more convenient Sorry for the bad news Let me know your thoughts and how you want to proceed or if you have any further question Thanks Anne Original Message From Crystal Burreson mailto Sent Tuesday October AM To Cc Subject Re Palau Anne Geir and I have not put a deposit down because we were waiting to see if the fares changed and to calm our nerves about flying such a long distance again We also were hoping to get a fare out of Portland to Honolulu because we did not prefer to fly out of LA There did come up a Special Fare on Hawaiian Airlines out of Portland to Honolulu So we went ahead a booked those tickets because of the drastic fare price difference We are not scheduled to fly out of Portland Oregon to Honolulu March st at am on flight arriving Honolulu at pm Then we depart Honolulu on flight at pm on March th arriving in Portland at pm The total fare was RT for both of us so we couldnt pass it up Looking at the itinerary that you sent us over a month ago It looks like the flight leaving Honolulu on March st at pm and arriving Guam March nd at pm would still work As well as the flight from Guam to Koror However arriving in Honolulu on March th at pm from Guam is not ideal We would have to stay overnight in Honolulu to catch the flight out on Hawaiian Airlines March th at pm This is not horrible however because we would be flying straight from Hawaii to Portland instead of routing through LA So we could just get a hotel for the night of the th if necessary Sorry about all the confusion but I had to book that Portland to Honolulu flight once I found out how much money and flight time we would save not having to go through LA Is there anyway you could arrange our new itinerary accounting for our booked flights out of Portland We would like to get the deposit paid on the remainder of the flight to Palau as well as the hotel stay Thank you again for the help and look forward to hearing from you soon Crystal and Geir PS We got the brochure for the other hotel besides Carolines and Sunset Villa How much of a price difference is this other hotel comparatively Also weve been highly encouraged to stay a while in Yap on this trip Could you tell me a little about accomodations and activities etc in Yap and how we could include that in our plans Ie staying at Carolines the first week getting married on March th etc Thank you From Annie Taylor To Subject Palau Date Mon Oct Hi Crystal Geir Wanted to follow up and see what the status was for your trip to Palau in March Our accounting department advises me that they havent received a deposit Can you please let me know what the status is on that Also just had another couple come back from Palau and Yap extremely happy Having just experienced it myself last month I agree Thanks Anne Anne Taylor ADVENTURE EXPRESS TRAVEL Second Ave North Seattle WA Toll Free ext Fax Get
