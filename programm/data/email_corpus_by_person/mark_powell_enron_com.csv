morning I just want to confirm the following We have agreed that we will use separate guarantees for the obligations of Engage Energy Canada LP Engage Canada with respect to each of Enron Canada Corp ECC and Enron North America Corp ENA This will allow for the appropriate guarantees to reference the peculiarities of each of Canadian and American law as applicable as well as deal with the potential permanent establishment tax issues we discussed As a result Dan does not need to review the draft guarantee I sent to him on Wednesday You are going to send me a revised credit sheet for the ECCEngage Canada master physical agreement which removes references to the obligations of Engage Canada to ENA likely requiring a guarantee of Westcoast Gas Inc on behalf of Engage Canada to ECC in the amount of USmillion the New ECC Guarantee Dan is to coordinate negotiatingobtaining a new guarantee from Westcoast Gas Inc on behalf of Engage Canada to ENA in the amount of US million pursuant to the master physical agreement between Engage Canada and ENA I am still not sure what we are doing with respect to the Enron Corp guarantee which was provided to Engage Canada and Engage Energy US LP Engage US in the amount of USmillion which guarantees the obligations of ENA EPMI and ECC the Existing Enron Corp Guarantee According to the credit sheet last provided to me Enron Corp is to provide a guarantee in the amount of USmillion but you were going to check to see if we were leaving the Existing Enron Corp Guarantee in place If we are replacingamending the Existing Enron Corp Guarantee we need to coordinate with counsel from all three of ENA EPMI and ECC to ensure that we are properly revoking the Existing Enron Corp Guarantee or amending it appropriately Ultimately I would prefer that the Existing Enron Guarantee be amended to remove the references to ECC such that we can arrange for a separate Enron Corp guarantee on behalf of ECC This would allow for greater flexibilityefficiency in the event that the industry or trading relationship between ECC and Engage Canada develops and future amendments are required Please let me know how you would like me to proceed with respect to point Thanks Mark Powell To Mark CT cc Dan J CT Debra CT Subject Re Engage Energy Canada LP Guarantee Mark The guaranty you are providing to Engage Energy Canada should cover both ECC and ENA although should only reference the Master Firm Contract between ECC and Engage Canada Dan has been working on a separate guaranty that will reference the Master Contract between ENA and Engage US that is currently being drafted The reason ENA is included on the guaranty for Engage Canada is because of business done at Dawn in Eastern Canada through ENA If you and Dan want to issue one guaranty to

in order to replace the existing securities representations as found near the bottom o f this email in the ISDA to It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission Rule OvertheCounter Derivatives From my perspective there are four main reasons why this amendment would n ot be appropriate They are as follows Proposed Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives and the corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted At this time is merely a proposal In addition to checking the Ontario Securities Commission OSC website I have contacted the lawyer who firs t brought the securities representation issue to our attention and he has confirmed that is not yet in place and there have been no recent announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such adoption Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto any trade with Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada is likely to be considered a trad e within Alberta under Alberta securities law due to the fact that the head office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta As a result it is important that we get representations which address Alberta securities law In a similar vein to point number above a trade can take place in a number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade Although it may seem unlikely it is possible that trades could possibly be made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario With the exception o f British Columbia I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting similar blanket orders policies or rules with respect to this issue However it is usually Ontario Alberta and British Columbia which are at t he forefront of Canadian securities law development with the remaining jurisdictions eventually following the leaders I expect that once is in place we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions Regardless it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi a in place at this time I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th e fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an OTC Derivative and thus have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions potentially available to them I can think of no reason why it would be beneficial to either party to remove this representation With respect to our physical agreements we have addressed points and above as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are provided by blanket orders and policies as opposed to the Securities Act Alberta Securities Act British Columbia or Securities Act Ontario a nd are thus more likely to be and more easily amended with the following clause i each Transaction shall constitute a commodity

Greg CT Subject Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA Hi Carol Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited WCL in order to replace the existing securities representations as found near the bottom o f this email in the ISDA to It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission Rule OvertheCounter Derivatives From my perspective there are four main reasons why this amendment would n ot be appropriate They are as follows Proposed Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives and the corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted At this time is merely a proposal In addition to checking the Ontario Securities Commission OSC website I have contacted the lawyer who firs t brought the securities representation issue to our attention and he has confirmed that is not yet in place and there have been no recent announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such adoption Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto any trade with Enron Canada Corp Enron Canada is likely to be considered a trad e within Alberta under Alberta securities law due to the fact that the head office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta As a result it is important that we get representations which address Alberta securities law In a similar vein to point number above a trade can take place in a number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade Although it may seem unlikely it is possible that trades could possibly be made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario With the exception o f British Columbia I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting similar blanket orders policies or rules with respect to this issue However it is usually Ontario Alberta and British Columbia which are at t he forefront of Canadian securities law development with the remaining jurisdictions eventually following the leaders I expect that once is in place we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions Regardless it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi a in place at this time I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th e fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an OTC Derivative and thus have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions potentially available to them I can think of no reason why it would be beneficial to either party to remove this representation With respect to our physical agreements we have addressed points and above as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are provided by blanket orders and policies as opposed to the Securities Act Alberta Securities Act British Columbia or Securities Act Ontario a nd are thus more likely to be and more easily amended with the following clause i each Transaction shall constitute a commodity contract or an OTC derivative or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi ties legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction and ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc and paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR in either case as amended restated replaced or reenacted fr om time to time and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta British Columbia or any other jurisdictions having application to the Transaction I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to the openended nature of the abovementioned clause If we want to refer to and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place I would suggest that we amend the existing clause which states Canadian Securities Acts i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC Derivative as defined in the Securities Act Alberta and the Securitie s Act British Columbia which have application to such Transaction and ii it i s a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Se curities Commission Order Doc andor paragraph of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC as in effect on the dat e hereof to Canadian Securities Legislation i Each Transaction shall constitute an OTC derivative within the meaning of paragraph of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc ASC paragraph of British Columb ia Securities Commission Blanket Order BORBC BCSC andor paragraph of proposed Ontario Securities Commission Rule OverTheCounter Derivatives as published by the Ontario Securities Commission on January Proposed OSC as applicable to such Transaction ii it is a Qualified Party within the meaning of paragraph of ASC andor paragraph of BCSC as in effe ct on the date hereof and iii it is a qualified party within the meaning of paragraph of Proposed OSC Once is formally adopted by the OSC the bold and square bracketed language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which were drafted using such language Similarly if there are amendments to t he Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province other than Ontario Alber ta or British Columbia which could possibly haveclaim some jurisdiction with respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy y ou may want to amend the clause and possibly the preexisting ISDAs I hope this discussion is useful for you If you have any questions pleas e do not hesitate to give me a call I can be reached directly at Mark

<25073580.1075852084155.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mark.powell@enron.com,2001-09-19 12:49:33,RE PGE DocumentsI can confirm Peters assertion that the changes we have requested to the Canadian form have yet to be incorporated into the US form Generally the US form is the same as the form which PGE provided to ECC back in with the exception that the US form has been amended to contemplate confirmations through EnronOnline and the insertion of the price indices to use to calculate liquidated damages As a result some of our comments ie the idea that a transaction is entered at the time of the telephone conversationonline transaction and is not dependent upon a confirmation being issued would apply equally to both the US form and the Canadian form However there are a number of changes which would have no bearing on the US form They are insertion of representations and warranties relating to a eligible financial contracts under Canadian insolvency law b certain Canadian securities representations amendments to Article Delivery Point whereby the delivery point is to be in Canada However the US Form does contain the clause relating to extraction rights at Cochrane Extraction Point in s which we are seeking to fix amendments to the liquidated damages mechanics in the Canadian form which utilize AECONIT as a basis The amended US Form includes a number of alternative indices however the amended US form does not contemplate changes to or lack of availability of the chosen indices and in Article amendments to the Canadian form re Delivery Point force majeure may not be applicable to the US form In addition to the Canadian jurisdiction matters there are certain amendments which we are seeking for Enron Canada which are not applicable to the US form These requests were needed for the Canadian form because PGEs counsel made a number of unsolicited changes to the Canadian form in his draft in May which are not found in the US form For example amendments to section on tape retention is not necessary in the US form as there is merely an obligation to protect the tapes from improper access as oppose to an obligation to protect the tapes from loss or tampering our amendments to the payment netting provisions of section are not necessary for the US form as the US form does not restrict netting of payments solely to monthly payments for Gas deliveries our proposed amendments to the collateralization provisions of section are not as key as the US form does not have a clause which i would effectively bar Enron from calling for collateral or ii include an acknowledgement that any security may require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and our proposed changes to section are not applicable as the US form does not provide PGE with the excuse of lack of Bankruptcy Court consent with respect to the provision of collateral Hopefully this gives you an idea of where we are at with the two documents If you have further questions prior to our meeting tomorrow please give me a call at Thanks Mark Original Message From Keohane Peter Sent Wednesday September AM To Tycholiz Barry Cc Powell Mark Subject RE PGE Documents Mark can do but as general proposition I think tht you can assume that none of the changes to the Canadian form have been made to the US form some of which will be jurisdictional to Canada and others of which will not Mark please prepare a brief summary Original Message From Tycholiz Barry Sent Wednesday September AM To Powell Mark Cc Keohane Peter Subject PGE Documents If one of the exercises is to standardize as best as possible the two agreements I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements Has this been done and if so can I have a copy to review I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie Call if you want to discuss BT
