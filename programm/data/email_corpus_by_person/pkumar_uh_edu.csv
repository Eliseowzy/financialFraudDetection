<15693587.1075863444981.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,pkumar@uh.edu,2001-09-21 13:36:25,Energy Institute CurriculumDear Vince We have been working on the curriculum for some of the educational programs to be offered by the Energy Markets Institute that Arthur Warga and I discussed with you in the summer I am attaching tentative curricula for two important programs A graduate certificate in Energy Finance A year BBAMS program in Energy Finance Briefly the certificate is a course forcredit program that is available to people with sufficient basic background in finance economics statistics and mathematics This certificate includes coursework in accounting issues specific to the energy industry basic aspects of energy sources and the organization and regulation of energy industry forecasting and timeseries econometric methodologies basics of financial engineering and derivatives realoptions and project analysis as it applies to the energy industry and energy derivatives and riskmanagament The year program is more ambitious It seeks to provide a broad but rigorous curriculum for future energy industry professionals and managers In the undergraduate component students take rigorous courses in math probability and statistics economics chemistry and physics and accounting and finance This is conceived to be an elite and highly demanding program where students have to handle the more demanding courses in a variety of areas The th or graduate year of the program is given over to the energy certificate and additional graduate courses in finance and accounting I know you are extremely busy but it would be very helpful to get your reaction even at a broad level to these programs and the type of courses that are envisaged We view these programs to potentially form the core of the educational activities of the Institute but the next step would be to develop more specialized programs of shorter duration aimed at professionals already working on challenging problems in the industry We are in the process of setting up the Institute and developing its governance and administrative structure I will give you more details very shortly On another topic Darrell Duffie with whom I interacted with a lot during our student days at Stanford will be coming to present a seminar at the Bauer College on January We very much hope to see you and the Enron group there Finally I hope that you and all of your loved ones and colleagues are as well as possible in light of the recent tragedies We can only hope pray and work to see that these senseless acts never again occur anywhere Best wishes Praveen Praveen Kumar Chair and Professor of Finance CT Bauer College of Business Melcher Hall University of Houston Houston TX fax winmaildat
