credits The NCL credits are for habitat disturbance only not incidental take KWB credits which include both are per acre If we paid that fee we would be covered but we still would have to buy credits from NCL The end result would be EOTT would have acres of unused credit in KWBs bank Cheryl would like to charge EOTT the difference between NCL credit and KWB credits If NCL credits are per acre we would own KWB per acre for being covered under there Master Permit Cheryl has a call into Mark Poe for this information and he has not returned her call I spoke with Mark this morning about this issue he said compensation credit prices had increased and was not sure what he quoted Gary Mark will verify and get back to me Scott if you can find anything in Garys files about this that would be great

Re Rogas Line USFW Approval Cheryl Harding at KWB was reviewing the approval letter from the Fish and Wildlife Service yesterday and was not ready to provide the proposed contract for acquisition of

in her office today I placed a call to Mark Poe to find out what compensation credits and administration fees cost are at NCL Do you know what they are Ed This was something else Gary was doing He has not returned my call Ed we still need to provide insurance certificates to West Kern Water District before we can start construction can you help with that Edward Attanasio PM To Kenny ott Scott ott cc Matt ott Bob JacobsLong ott Susan ott Molly ott Larry CampbellET nron Rich JollyET nron John nroncom Louis SoldanoET nron Subject Rogas Line USFW Approval Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT dated February from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our project for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank and authorizing the Water Bank to extend their incidental take authority to you and your entire project under their Master Permit This is of course very good news The letter notes however that we still need to purchase compensation acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank Specifically we must do the following contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to acquire acres of compensation credits and to get included in their Master Permit and get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve Mark Poe of Aera stating that we have purchased acres of credits for North Coles Levee or that we have set aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased While I could make these contacts I do not believe that would be wise because as Kenny can attest our past experience has been that whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank it prompts them to automatically get their lawyers involved And our experience has been that this only slows things down or worse My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for proposed contract for acquisition of acres of compensation credits and perperwork to include EOTT and its contractors in their Master Permit She should also be informed that while we have not yet purchased the acres of NCL credits we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security as allowed under our State Take Permit to cover this amount of acreage Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes or whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed Please call me if you have any questions or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to approach this issue Thanks a lot ETA

contractors to be put on Kern Water Banks Master Permit Compensation credit will cost with an additional to add EOTT to the Master Permit so we are covered for incidental take at NCL In order for the pipeline project to get started the following things must happen Give the Kern Water Bank a check for A contractor constructing a water line adjacent to EOTTs ROW has cleared the habitat This should reduce EOTTs disturbance acreage by a small amount I suggest we go ahead an purchase the acres so we can get started if we have any credits left we can use them on the removal of the existing Rogas pipeline We need to make a decision on weather we are going to purchase acres of compensation credit from Area for NCL or try to use the existing credits we received with the purchase of the plant I have tried to get in contact with Jeff Single at the Fish and Game to set up a meeting to work out details of managing the existing credits but have not been able to speak with him I believe the process to enable us to use credits we already own will not be accomplished in time to use on this project Scott Jones is working with Mark Poe at Area on what compensation credits from Area will cost He originally was quoted an acre to Area an acre endowment fee to the Fish and Game and an acre for fencing to the Fish and Game Scott talked with Gary Fuller and was informed that Mark had previously quoted an acre to Area Scott asked Mark about the lower price he is checking into it and will get back to Scott Once we purchase the compensation credits from Area Mark will need to notify Cheryl Harding at KWB and then she will sell EOTT the KWB compensation credits and add EOTT to the Master Permit Since the Fish and Wildlife project approval letter stated she was to be notified of the purchase of credits form Area a letter of credit will not be acceptable We also need to provide the letter of approval for the project from the Fish and Game to Mark Poe It is my understanding we have only received verbal approval and have not gotten a hard copy Randi McCormick is going to get the letter We need to provide insurance certificates to West Kern Water as stated in the encroachment permit before start of construction Josie Castrejana is going to provide those We still do not have the permits for the road bores at State Hwy and Interstate The state has the permits ready but they want proof we have ROW with the land owners on either side of the highways As soon as KWB gives back the signed recorded agreements I will provide that to Caltrans and then they will issue the permits The other missing permit is for the crossing of the Kern River bypass channel Larry is working on that permit we should have the permit by the time we reach the channel with the pipelines Scott Jones
