Reload Facility Premier Yesterday I was informed that there was a concern about the financial stability of one of the reload facilities we currently use in the Chicago area Premier Reload Inc I met with Romney Ruder Lumber trader Roy Lipsett Logistics and Mike Moscoso Lumber business controller this morning to gather information and develop a plan This is summarized below General Information Premier is a facility we have been using for a few months located in Franklin Park within Chicago We deliver to the facility via railcar and ship out via truck We currently have about million board feet valued at about million in the facility During the holidays we began experiencing problems with our railcars not being unloaded timely We have been pressing for information and are hearing rumors that have raised significant concerns Although Enron has not received written notification we learned today that Premier notified customers that they would not be taking in any more products Additionally we have heard that the owner Jeff Leske is closing the facility and will be going to work for another reload facility in Chicago Reserve Marine Terminal RMT We have been in negotiations with RMT for a long term arrangement and much of the information we have obtained is through our contact there In fact we have diverted recent shipments to RMT There is a rumor that Premier and or Leske may declare bankruptcy There is a rumor that Premier has been incurring switching fees with the railroad IHB and has not been paying them There is a rumor that Premier has not been paying employment taxes and there are problems with the IRS All in all there are many rumors but very few known facts Plan Met with Legal today to get advice They recommended moving the product ASAP but until moved we needed to confirm the product was marked as Enron product and that it is stored separately from other product They are drafting a contract to specify the arrangement with Premier It will be ready tomorrow Met with Credit They are not a included in the reload selection process so the financial stability of the company has not been reviewed A DB was pulled today and it confirms a lien filed by the IRS on for There is one suit pending by a trucking company in a nominal amount filed The company is owned by Leske and was started in Very little other information is available and DB did not assign a PAYDEX score Mike Moscoso and Romney Ruder are going to the premises tomorrow to gather financial information intentions of the owner and the associated timeline substantiate the inventory and get the contract signed that Legal is drafting On Friday morning Roy Lipsett will join them to meet with RMT discuss movement of the product and complete the negotiations Depending on the information gathered tomorrow we will determine next steps If we start moving the product to RMT the estimated timeline is about to days moving trucks per day total truckloads Estimated cost for the movement is about is Another would be incurred for unload fees at RMT if we cant get them to wave them About half of the product has already been sold and will be delivered over the next weeks Romney is working with customers to determine if they can take the product earlier I will keep you informed as to the next events However we need to take immediate steps to put a policy and process in place for warehousing facilities I have initiated weekly crossfunctional staff meetings Tax Legal Credit IT Logistics Fundemental Analysis Accounting etc and our first meeting is scheduled for
