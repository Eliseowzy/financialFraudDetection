organizational framework has been set As you know Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new responsibilities within Enron Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and Joe Kishkill who will become the CoPresidents of South America reporting to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato They will share overall responsibility however Orlandos focus will be on direct sales origination commercialgovernment relationships and regulatory issues Joes focus will be on wholesale origination financial and operating performance and overal l country management In addition Orlando will continue as President and CE O of Elektro until its ultimate sale The existing large integrated asset base in South America excluding Elektro will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in Enron Global Assets which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark Frevert Ultimately there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a nd Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our reputation in South America is protected our asset positions are being managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset s are pursued The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo rk business model This model employs people market making physical commodities capital and assets to provide reliable flexible and highvalu e products to our customers It is people and intellectual capital based and enjoys high rates of return on invested capital In the interest of pursuing this strategy the following teams will report to Joe and Orlando The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs The team will focus on covering South American markets primarily Brazilian and Argentine natural gas and electricity with the following goals Generating new innovative reliable and high value products and services needed by the market by utilizing our commodity asset and capital capabilities Providing those products and services across South America and across the value chain including wholesale and retail based upon the highest value opportunity Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move quickly to capitalize Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the overall risk of the organization Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri ca consistent with this strategy and Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization

John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ as risk activities The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups

focused The following support functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea m and will report into Joe and Orlando plus into their line functions in Houston The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities as well as manage daytoday business and risk Otherwise the Houston infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements in South America not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas These groups include The Government Affairs team which will be headed by Sergio Assad will manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as governmental ministries The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate in the near term substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina Sergio will assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale During th is interim period Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator y function Once Sergio makes the transition he will also report to Rick Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs The Finance

who will become the CoPresidents of South America reporting to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato They will share overall responsibility however Orlandos focus will be on direct sales origination commercialgovernment relationships and regulatory issues Joes focus will be on wholesale origination financial and operating performance and overal l country management In addition Orlando will continue as President and CE O of Elektro until its ultimate sale The existing large integrated asset base in South America excluding Elektro will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in Enron Global Assets which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark Frevert Ultimately there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a nd Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our reputation in South America is protected our asset positions are being managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset s are pursued The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo rk business model This model employs people market making physical commodities capital and assets to provide reliable flexible and highvalu e products to our customers It is people and intellectual capital based and enjoys high rates of return on invested capital In the interest of pursuing this strategy the following teams will report to Joe and Orlando The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs The team will focus on covering South American markets primarily Brazilian and Argentine natural gas and electricity with the following goals Generating new innovative reliable and high value products and services needed by the market by utilizing our commodity asset and capital capabilities Providing those products and services across South America and across the value chain including wholesale and retail based upon the

<7332221.1075855830353.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kay.chapman@enron.com,2000-04-18 01:55:00,Meetingscurrently we have two meetings a week between the business unit heads to discuss deal flow and communicate issues and opportunties the Monday morning meeting and the Friday managing director meeting I would suggest that we eliminate both these meetings I would propose that we replace them with a single Friday afternoon meeting from PM to PM The business unit heads identified above would be invited At this meeting I would expect less of a reporting focus and employ a more candid and detailed discussion of opportunities problems and issues between the partners in this company It would include i a review of current DASHs ii a more detailed discussion around the opportunities identified on the Hot Sheet iii a more candid discussion around the PL and tactics required to meet overall financial targets and iv provide a forum to provide input into and communicate business strategies between the business units In other words employ the goals of the Friday managing director meeting with all the business unit leaders represented Given the religious holidays this week there will be no meeting this Friday I would suggest that we have a regular Monday morning meeting next Monday and we will start this new forum a week from this Friday This meeting would be held in C and Monterrey Calgary and Portland should be connected via video conference In order for this to work and be effective the business unit heads need to be available and participate actively in the discussion If you have questions comments or concerns do not hesitate to let me know Regards Delainey

<31880823.1075854481463.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kay.chapman@enron.com,2000-11-13 05:31:00,Re ConfidentialW Delainey AM To cc Brian CT Timothy J CT Subject Confidential Dwayne in response to your request I am providing a quick summary of our discussion on Friday As I had mentioned this is a competitive process and time is of the essence If we get resolution to these points I would be prepared to sit down over a finite period of time three or four days to try and hammer out the transaction Specifically AEP Point ENA would accept a triggering event and MAC clause for the lease This would under certain conditions allow AEP to purchase the leased assets at the present value of the future lease payments plus the fair value in year thirty of the underlying assets at an agreed upon discount rate The triggering events would include bankruptcy insolvency or Enron Corp falling below investment grade An Enron Corp guarantee would be offered to secure that covenant We would similarly ask for similar credit language in the lease agreement with an AEP parental guarantee securing the lease obligation from AEP These paragraphs would be constructed in a similar manner to triggering events and MAC clauses in master commodity documents ENA would also acknowledge that it would not sell the lease or physical assets underlying the lease to any other party but AEP I would anticipate that this would be managed through a ROFR structure This would ensure that AEP would have access to the assets if sold and that AEP can feel confortable that they will be dealing with Enron for the period of the lease Notwithstanding above Enron needs the flexibility to pledge or sell the AEP lease stream in order to monetize your obligation to cash if desired This makes the setoff language difficult With the triggering event and MAC clause the need for setoff to protect AEP in the event of Enron default should not be required AEP Point ENA would agree to a three month noncompete which prohibits ENA from soliciting business with the suppliers or producers connected to the Pipeline This noncompete would apply to transactions over one month in duration This would apply to ENA only and no other Enron Corp affiliates AEP Point I believe that ENA has already agreed in principal to your request under this point AEP Point ENA would require indemnity limitation including representation and warranties and basic construction similar to our last draft language previously provided to you Would also request a two year window rather than three on environmental claims AEP Point ENA would counter with a million break up fee if AEP does not get requisite SEC approval by April AEP Point On HSR and FERC approvals AEPs position as layed out in the letter is not practical since it would be very difficult to pull out certain pieces of the pipe from the deal and ensure that both parties get the benefit of the bargain If AEP is unwilling to give an asset divestment covenant and given AEPs limited gas infrastructure position ENAs position is that AEP should take the risk that they will be able to get the approvals Other ENA will not agree as a condition to this transaction a settlement of any FERC issues between AEP and EPMI however ENA would always be willing to discuss such items in a different forum If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact myself or Tim Detmering Regards Dave Delainey

who will become the CoPresidents of South America reporting to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato They will share overall responsibility however Orlandos focus will be on direct sales origination commercialgovernment relationships and regulatory issues Joes focus will be on wholesale origination financial and operating performance and overal l country management In addition Orlando will continue as President and CE O of Elektro until its ultimate sale The existing large integrated asset base in South America excluding Elektro will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in Enron Global Assets which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark Frevert Ultimately there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a nd Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our reputation in South America is protected our asset positions are being managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset s are pursued The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo rk business model This model employs people market making physical commodities capital and assets to provide reliable flexible and highvalu e products to our customers It is people and intellectual capital based and enjoys high rates of return on invested capital In the interest of pursuing this strategy the following teams will report to Joe and Orlando The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs The team will focus on covering South American markets primarily Brazilian and Argentine natural gas and electricity with the following goals Generating new innovative reliable and high value products and services needed by the market by utilizing our commodity asset and capital capabilities Providing those products and services across South America and across the value chain including wholesale and retail based upon the

be headed by Sergio Assad will manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as governmental ministries The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate in the near term substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina Sergio will assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale During th is interim period Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator y function Once Sergio makes the transition he will also report to Rick Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs The Finance

organizational framework has been set As you know Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new responsibilities within Enron Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and Joe Kishkill who will become the CoPresidents of South America reporting to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato They will share overall responsibility however Orlandos focus will be on direct sales origination commercialgovernment relationships and regulatory issues Joes focus will be on wholesale origination financial and operating performance and overal l country management In addition Orlando will continue as President and CE O of Elektro until its ultimate sale The existing large integrated asset base in South America excluding Elektro will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in Enron Global Assets which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark Frevert Ultimately there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a nd Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our reputation in South America is protected our asset positions are being managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset s are pursued The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo rk business model This model employs people market making physical commodities capital and assets to provide reliable flexible and highvalu e products to our customers It is people and intellectual capital based and enjoys high rates of return on invested capital In the interest of pursuing this strategy the following teams will report to Joe and Orlando The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs The team will focus on covering South American markets primarily Brazilian and Argentine natural gas and electricity with the following goals Generating new innovative reliable and high value products and services needed by the market by utilizing our commodity asset and capital capabilities Providing those products and services across South America and across the value chain including wholesale and retail based upon the highest value opportunity Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move quickly to capitalize Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the overall

focused The following support functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea m and will report into Joe and Orlando plus into their line functions in Houston The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities as well as manage daytoday business and risk Otherwise the Houston infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements in South America not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas These groups include The Government Affairs team which will be headed by Sergio Assad will manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as governmental ministries The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate in the near term substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina Sergio will assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale During th is interim period Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator y function Once Sergio makes the transition he will also report to Rick Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs The Finance

Services Legal Department Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff Human Resources Information Technology Treasury Accounting Reporting as well as Administration wil l report to Miguel This will bring focus to essential but noncommercial functions as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting relationships with Enron Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron Wholesale Services Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale Services Business Analysis and Reporting These changes are consistent with Enrons evolving business strategy and reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our financial and intellectual capital However in line with the new organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the region further budget reductions will be necessary People directly affected will be notified shortly Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its businesses in South America We believe that as the markets
