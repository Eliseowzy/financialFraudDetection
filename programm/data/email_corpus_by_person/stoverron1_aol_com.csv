friends I do not usually forward messages but this is from my good friend Pearlas Sanborn and she really is an attorney If she says that this will work it WILL work After all what have you got to lose SORRY EVERYBODYJUST HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE Im an attorney and I know the law This thing is for real Rest assured AOL and Intel will follow through with their promises for fear of facing a multimillion dollar class action suit similar to the one filed by PepsiCo against General Electric not too long ago Were not going to help them out with their email beta test without getting a little something for our time My brothers girlfriend got in on this a few months ago When I went to visit him for the BaylorUT game She showed me her check It was for the sum of and was stamped Paid In Full Like I said before I know the law and this is for real Intel and AOL are now discussing a merger which would make them the largest Internet company and in an effort make sure that AOL remains the most widely used program Intel and AOL are running an email beta test When you forward this email to friends Intel can and will track it if you are a Microsoft Windows user for a two week time period For every person that you forward this email to Microsoft will pay you For every person that you sent it to that forwards it on Microsoft will pay you And for every third person that receives it you will be paid Within two weeks Intel will contact you for your address and then send you a check I thought this was a scam myself but a friend of my good friends Aunt Patricia who works at Intel actually got a check of by forwarding this email Try it what have you got to lose
