provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection eg the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to Transmission Service not interconnection service Although I havent done a detailed review of PGEs tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections and Also transmission service should be capitalized Some Other suggestions Preamble Sentence three delete these Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System Insert These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System Sentence four delete of the Transmission System Parts II and III are defined terms Section Under this provision if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that materially affect its interconnection it can lose its place in the queue Given how much discretion this gives PGE materially affect should be a defined term or have a standard for its application Section Revise the last sentence as follows The Interconnection Customer must execute complete and return Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures Section This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects Section iii Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection Accordingly Section iii should be changed to have the information studied for the customers information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue Section When does the customers responsibility to respond to higherqueued projects end Does this extend the day period every time it happens Section In sentence two Delete Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and Work the following definitions into Section Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission lines to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection In sentence three delete modifications or additions to the Transmission Providers transmission lines and substations and add Network Upgrades Proofread and correct section numbers To Mary CT cc James D nron Subject Re Draft interconnection procedure Comments Delete last sentence If Enron is already in the queue or considered in a queue before a TPs interconnection procedures are filed at FERC we dont want to have to resubmit something within days in order to remain in the queue I dont think this is necessary and all are protected because preexisting requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue Enron has argued for days consistent with the OATT times lost unfortunately It may look odd for PGE to ask for days PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than days you send a notification I realize that this language was included in CPL but recommend these changes for PGE Add after as modified by the Commission if Customer chooses to commence construction Modify last sentence The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable

provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection eg the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to Transmission Service not interconnection service Although I havent done a detailed review of PGEs tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections and Also transmission service should be capitalized Some Other suggestions Preamble Sentence three delete these Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System Insert These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System Sentence four delete of the Transmission System Parts II and III are defined terms Section Under this provision if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that materially affect its interconnection it can lose its place in the queue Given how much discretion this gives PGE materially affect should be a defined term or have a standard for its application Section Revise the last sentence as follows The Interconnection Customer must execute complete and return Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures Section This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects Section iii Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection Accordingly Section iii should be changed to have the information studied for the customers information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue Section When does the customers responsibility to respond to higherqueued projects end Does this extend the day period every time it happens Section In sentence two Delete Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and Work the following definitions into Section Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission lines to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection In sentence three delete modifications or additions to the Transmission Providers transmission lines and substations and add Network Upgrades Proofread and correct section numbers To Mary CT cc James D nron Subject Re Draft interconnection procedure Comments Delete last sentence If Enron is already in the queue or considered in a queue before a TPs interconnection procedures are filed at FERC we dont want to have to resubmit something within days in order to remain in the queue I dont think this is necessary and all are protected because preexisting requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue Enron has argued for days consistent with the OATT times lost unfortunately It may look odd for PGE to ask for days PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than days you send a notification I realize that this language was included in CPL but recommend these changes for PGE Add after as modified by the Commission if Customer chooses to commence construction Modify last sentence The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable

for studies ends when the IA is executed or filed unsigned at FERC Mary Hain PM To cc James D nron Christi L CT Subject Re Draft interconnection procedure As I mentioned over the phone the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection eg the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to Transmission Service not interconnection service Although I havent done a detailed review of PGEs tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections and Also transmission service should be capitalized Some Other suggestions Preamble Sentence three delete these Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System Insert These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System Sentence four delete of the Transmission System Parts II and III are defined terms Section Under this provision if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that materially affect its interconnection it can lose its place in the queue Given how much discretion this gives PGE materially affect should be a defined term or have a standard for its application Section Revise the last sentence as follows The Interconnection Customer must execute complete and return Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures Section This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects Section iii Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection Accordingly Section iii should be changed to have the information studied for the customers information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue Section When does the customers responsibility to respond to higherqueued projects end Does this extend the day period every time it happens Section In sentence two Delete Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and Work the following definitions into Section Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission lines to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection In sentence three delete modifications or additions to the Transmission Providers transmission lines and substations and add Network Upgrades Proofread and correct section numbers To Mary CT cc James D nron Subject Re Draft interconnection procedure Comments Delete last sentence If Enron is already in the queue or considered in a queue before a TPs interconnection procedures are filed at FERC we dont want to have to resubmit something within days in order to remain in the queue I dont think this is necessary and all are protected because preexisting requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue Enron has argued for days consistent with the OATT times lost unfortunately It may look odd for PGE to ask for days PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than days you send a notification I realize that this language was included in CPL but recommend these changes for PGE Add after as modified by the Commission if Customer chooses to commence construction Modify last sentence The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

<12357086.1075846198625.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,christi.nicolay@enron.com,2000-12-06 01:03:00,For the FERC staff lunch FERC Investigation summariesARE SUMMARIES OF THE HELPFUL FERC STAFF INVESTIGATIONS LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S E including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigatio n found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac k of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communicati on are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase rais es the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv e operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d o not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions i e treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio n of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal la w and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff list s a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct includin g confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchan ge information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available t o FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are attached below southeastpdf midwestpdf NORTHEAST SUMMARY Attached is a summary of FERC Staffs November report on its investigation of the Northeast region The report is very encouraging because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution s that Enron has been advocating for years The report is also encouraging because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast markets and the problems in these markets by the FERC people who worked o n this report Because this is only a brief summary the entire report particularly sections and should be read in

Comments Docket No RM In March a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market For example the Petition asserts Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing rather than accommodating transactions Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical accurate information across control areas This can take the form of outofdate or incorrect postings of ATC or in some instances intentional withholding of actual ATC Regardless of the cause more transmission capability Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference Docket No RM July transcript at Id at The group consists of a number of power marketers and users including for example Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market ELCON Electric Clearinghouse Inc and Enron Power Marketing Inc Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain OpenAccess Commercial Practices Docket No RM Docket No RM is physically available than is being released for sale The Petition alleges the existence of ATC exclusions inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities and therefore prevent reasonable access to the grid The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale EPSA the trade association representing certain power suppliers filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers by for example minimizing reported available transmission capability ATC delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS or otherwise manipulating market operations EPSA further stated that The manipulation of ATC whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS Petition at Id at Id at Appendix D EPSA Comments Docket No RM at filed September Docket No RM management is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Mississippi of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment Yazoo City as a participant has experienced first hand an individual transmission owners continued ability to use its ownership and control of transmission to disadvantage competitors notwithstanding Order s mandate of nondiscriminatory transmission access The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a MW power sale because of transmission restrictions but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself The representative concluded that Orders Nos and have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmissiondependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors Id at Comments of Robert D Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Regional ISO Conference New Orleans Transcript at After hearing this assertion Entergy Services Inc filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergyimposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase See Letter in Docket No PL filed July Docket No RM One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin CBM Although there is no single accepted definition CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC There is no uniform method for calculating CBM The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission For example with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pools historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is NERC Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations June at The Commission recently noticed a technical conference to be held May and on the issue of CBM See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity Notice of Technical Conference Docket No EL Docket No RM consistent with our open access policies The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending In another pending proceeding concerning WPSCs CBM calculation two of the parties assert that CBM removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition and fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBMrelated transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC In the same proceeding Electric Clearinghouse Inc asserts that the CBM setaside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users As we stated above we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made PJM FERC at Protest of Madison Gas Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc Docket No EL at filed August Protest of Electric Clearinghouse Inc Docket No EL at filed August Docket No RM findings They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission

on PM To Christi L Nicolay James D Steffes cc Tabors Richard Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject RE Dan Larcamp request Christi Jim et al This last exchange has been very helpful The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively Fairly quickly a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today along with the midwest and also get a glimmer on rumor picked up here the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers The conclusion from was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments load response Presumably this would carry forward to a study A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in Here we would need to do two things The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions the lesson of not all kWh This is different from price spikes in the pool markets where they set the price for all kWh The second point is to see that there is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge ie that you could look on EOL and buy forward a x for the summer say and pay a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by absorbing it in a month contract The price signal for investment conclusion would carry forward as above What do you think the level of interest need is and how quickly does he need some or all of the answers This is a good time for TCA to tackle this We have or had a quiet moment for both Fagan and Rao who are the two experts on data development and analysis from published sources Christi lets talk in the morning so I can scope an RCR Thank you Richard Original Message From Christi L Nicolay mailto Sent Tuesday July PM To James D Steffes Cc Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Thanks JimDan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff In that regard we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enrons tools He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps I didnt get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine In fact we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a seminar type activity for some of his senior staffers He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues etc He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid He also asked Kevin why Enron doesnt want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we cant trade with ourselves As it is now there are less than big players due to the transmission risk We explained in detail what happens in the Into Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmissionphysical risk Kevin said that even the big bank players like Morgan Stanley usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk Dan L having come from gas understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin He sat down in Kevins chair and looked at pricing on EOL Overall it was a very positive meeting Kevin was impressed that Dan L really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something but needed help in educating his people James D ES PM To Christi L CT cc ECT Joe CT Richard ES Steven J ES Rob NRON Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Document link Christi L Nicolay Christi etal I dont disagree with this analysis but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill Competitive generation is also about risk transfer regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders In addition I hope that Larcamp wont take our data analysis and try to argue that everything is fine Clearly there are many undone misdone public policy problems eg native load exception hourly transmission etc left in the wholesale energy markets Jim To cc Joe nron James D ES Richard ES Subject Dan Larcamp request Richard T Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year He needs this to fight price caps How much would something like that cost probably using some of the data you gathered last year How long would it take to create Thanks for your help

Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

on PM To Christi L Nicolay James D Steffes cc Tabors Richard Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject RE Dan Larcamp request Christi Jim et al This last exchange has been very helpful The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively Fairly quickly a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today along with the midwest and also get a glimmer on rumor picked up here the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers The conclusion from was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments load response Presumably this would carry forward to a study A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in Here we would need to do two things The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions the lesson of not all kWh This is different from price spikes in the pool markets where they set the price for all kWh The second point is to see that there is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge ie that you could look on EOL and buy forward a x for the summer say and pay a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by absorbing it in a month contract The price signal for investment conclusion would carry forward as above What do you think the level of interest need is and how quickly does he need some or all of the answers This is a good time for TCA to tackle this We have or had a quiet moment for both Fagan and Rao who are the two experts on data development and analysis from published sources Christi lets talk in the morning so I can scope an RCR Thank you Richard Original Message From Christi L Nicolay mailto Sent Tuesday July PM To James D Steffes Cc Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Thanks JimDan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff In that regard we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enrons tools He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps I didnt get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine In fact we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a seminar type activity for some of his senior staffers He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues etc He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid He also asked Kevin why Enron doesnt want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we cant trade with ourselves As it is now there are less than big players due to the transmission risk We explained in detail what happens in the Into Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmissionphysical risk Kevin said that even the big bank players like Morgan Stanley usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk Dan L having come from gas understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin He sat down in Kevins chair and looked at pricing on EOL Overall it was a very positive meeting Kevin was impressed that Dan L really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something but needed help in educating his people James D ES PM To Christi L CT cc ECT Joe CT Richard ES Steven J ES Rob NRON Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Document link Christi L Nicolay Christi etal I dont disagree with this analysis but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill Competitive generation is also about risk transfer regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders In addition I hope that Larcamp wont take our data analysis and try to argue that everything is fine Clearly there are many undone misdone public policy problems eg native load exception hourly transmission etc left in the wholesale energy markets Jim To cc Joe nron James D ES Richard ES Subject Dan Larcamp request Richard T Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year He needs this to fight price caps How much would something like that cost probably using some of the data you gathered last year How long would it take to create Thanks for your help

LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S E including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigatio n found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac k of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communicati on are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase rais es the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv e operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d o not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions i e treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio n of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal la w and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff list s a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct includin g confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchan ge information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available t o FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

NOPR Comments This is an excerpt from FERCs Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on RTOs eventually became Rule It references the petition that Enron etal filed at FERC which includes examples I forwarded you the petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson I thought she may be interested in this Forwarded by Christi L NicolayHOUECT on PM Linda L ES PM To Christi L CT cc Subject NOPR Comments Docket No RM In March a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market For example the Petition asserts Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing rather than accommodating transactions Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical accurate information across control areas This can take the form of outofdate or incorrect postings of ATC or in some instances intentional withholding of actual ATC Regardless of the cause more transmission capability Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference Docket No RM July transcript at Id at The group consists of a number of power marketers and users including for example Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market ELCON Electric Clearinghouse Inc and Enron Power Marketing Inc Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain OpenAccess Commercial Practices Docket No RM Docket No RM is physically available than is being released for sale The Petition alleges the existence of ATC exclusions inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities and therefore prevent reasonable access to the grid The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale EPSA the trade association representing certain power suppliers filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers by for example minimizing reported available transmission capability ATC delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS or otherwise manipulating market operations EPSA further stated that The manipulation of ATC whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS Petition at Id at Id at Appendix D EPSA Comments Docket No RM at filed September Docket No RM management is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Mississippi of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment Yazoo City as a participant has experienced first hand an individual transmission owners continued ability to use its ownership and control of transmission to disadvantage competitors notwithstanding Order s mandate of nondiscriminatory transmission access The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a MW power sale because of transmission restrictions but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself The representative concluded that Orders Nos and have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmissiondependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors Id at Comments of Robert D Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Regional ISO Conference New Orleans Transcript at After hearing this assertion Entergy Services Inc filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergyimposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase See Letter in Docket No PL filed July Docket No RM One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin CBM Although there is no single accepted definition CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC There is no uniform method for calculating CBM The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission For example with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pools historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is NERC Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations June at The Commission recently noticed a technical conference to be held May and on the issue of CBM See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity Notice of Technical Conference Docket No EL Docket No RM consistent with our open access policies The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending In another pending proceeding concerning WPSCs CBM calculation two of the parties assert that CBM removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition and fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBMrelated transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC In the same proceeding Electric Clearinghouse Inc asserts that the CBM setaside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users As we stated above we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made PJM FERC at Protest of Madison Gas Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc Docket No EL at filed August Protest of Electric Clearinghouse Inc Docket No EL at filed August Docket No RM findings They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission

includes some dings against TVA On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion

Christi L CT Sarah NRON Susan J NRON Dave CT Paul nronXgate Janel nron Jeff nron cc Subject LV valley endures blackouts Now heres an unintended consequence price caps cause less supply to be available marketers cannot sell above cap and generators must be subject to cost filings if they do and the result is black outs Alan Tuesday July Copyright Las Vegas ReviewJournal POWER SHORTAGES LV valley endures blackouts Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week By JOHN G EDWARDS REVIEWJOURNAL The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S E including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigatio n found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac k of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communicati on are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase rais es the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv e operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d o not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions i e treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio n of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal la w and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff list s a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct includin g confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchan ge information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available t o FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are attached below southeastpdf midwestpdf NORTHEAST SUMMARY Attached is a summary of FERC Staffs November report on its investigation of the Northeast region The report is very encouraging because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution s that Enron has been advocating for years The report is also encouraging because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the

incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

<18185924.1075850999915.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,christi.nicolay@enron.com,2000-11-10 07:26:00,Has TVA info FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems Cc CynthiaThe SE reports includes some dings against TVA On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement

reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion

LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area

Comments Docket No RM In March a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market For example the Petition asserts Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing rather than accommodating transactions Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical accurate information across control areas This can take the form of outofdate or incorrect postings of ATC or in some instances intentional withholding of actual ATC Regardless of the cause more transmission capability Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference Docket No RM July transcript at Id at The group consists of a number of power marketers and users including for example Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market ELCON Electric Clearinghouse Inc and Enron Power Marketing Inc Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain OpenAccess Commercial Practices Docket No RM Docket No RM is physically available than is being released for sale The Petition alleges the existence of ATC exclusions inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities and therefore prevent reasonable access to the grid The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale EPSA the trade association representing certain power suppliers filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers by for example minimizing reported available transmission capability ATC delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS or otherwise manipulating market operations EPSA further stated that The manipulation of ATC whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS Petition at Id at Id at Appendix D EPSA Comments Docket No RM at filed September Docket No RM management is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Mississippi of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment Yazoo City as a participant has experienced first hand an individual transmission owners continued ability to use its ownership and control of transmission to disadvantage competitors notwithstanding Order s mandate of nondiscriminatory transmission access The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a MW power sale because of transmission restrictions but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself The representative concluded that Orders Nos and have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmissiondependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors Id at Comments of Robert D Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Regional ISO Conference New Orleans Transcript at After hearing this assertion Entergy Services Inc filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergyimposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase See Letter in Docket No PL filed July Docket No RM One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin CBM Although there is no single accepted definition CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC There is no uniform method for calculating CBM The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission For example with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pools historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is NERC Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations June at The Commission recently noticed a technical conference to be held May and on the issue of CBM See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity Notice of Technical Conference Docket No EL Docket No RM consistent with our open access policies The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending In another pending proceeding concerning WPSCs CBM calculation two of the parties assert that CBM removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition and fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBMrelated transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC In the same proceeding Electric Clearinghouse Inc asserts that the CBM setaside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users As we stated above we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made PJM FERC at Protest of Madison Gas Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc Docket No EL at filed August Protest of Electric Clearinghouse Inc Docket No EL at filed August Docket No RM findings They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission

on PM To Christi L Nicolay James D Steffes cc Tabors Richard Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject RE Dan Larcamp request Christi Jim et al This last exchange has been very helpful The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively Fairly quickly a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today along with the midwest and also get a glimmer on rumor picked up here the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers The conclusion from was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments load response Presumably this would carry forward to a study A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in Here we would need to do two things The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions the lesson of not all kWh This is different from price spikes in the pool markets where they set the price for all kWh The second point is to see that there is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge ie that you could look on EOL and buy forward a x for the summer say and pay a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by absorbing it in a month contract The price signal for investment conclusion would carry forward as above What do you think the level of interest need is and how quickly does he need some or all of the answers This is a good time for TCA to tackle this We have or had a quiet moment for both Fagan and Rao who are the two experts on data development and analysis from published sources Christi lets talk in the morning so I can scope an RCR Thank you Richard Original Message From Christi L Nicolay mailto Sent Tuesday July PM To James D Steffes Cc Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Thanks JimDan Larcamp seemed to genuinely want to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff In that regard we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enrons tools He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps I didnt get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine In fact we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a seminar type activity for some of his senior staffers He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues etc He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid He also asked Kevin why Enron doesnt want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we cant trade with ourselves As it is now there are less than big players due to the transmission risk We explained in detail what happens in the Into Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmissionphysical risk Kevin said that even the big bank players like Morgan Stanley usually flip the product before it goes to liquidation so they do not have to take transmission risk Dan L having come from gas understood the liquidity issues and had a good discussion with Kevin He sat down in Kevins chair and looked at pricing on EOL Overall it was a very positive meeting Kevin was impressed that Dan L really understood the issues and acted like he wanted to do something but needed help in educating his people James D ES PM To Christi L CT cc ECT Joe CT Richard ES Steven J ES Rob NRON Subject Re Dan Larcamp request Document link Christi L Nicolay Christi etal I dont disagree with this analysis but the drive for competitive generation is not simply related to the short term benefits one year total energy bill versus next year total energy bill Competitive generation is also about risk transfer regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers merchant generation assigns all new plant risk to shareholders In addition I hope that Larcamp wont take our data analysis and try to argue that everything is fine Clearly there are many undone misdone public policy problems eg native load exception hourly transmission etc left in the wholesale energy markets Jim To cc Joe nron James D ES Richard ES Subject Dan Larcamp request Richard T Dan Larcamp of FERC was here today and asked for a comprehensive real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes including how much they saved as a result of hopefully lower prices for the remainder of the year He needs this to fight price caps How much would something like that cost probably using some of the data you gathered last year How long would it take to create Thanks for your help

valley endures blackouts Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week By JOHN G EDWARDS REVIEWJOURNAL The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

<3086621.1075848118518.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,christi.nicolay@enron.com,2000-12-06 01:03:00,For the FERC staff lunch FERC Investigation summariesARE SUMMARIES OF THE HELPFUL FERC STAFF INVESTIGATIONS LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S E including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigatio n found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac k of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communicati on are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase rais es the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv e operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d o not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions i e treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio n of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal la w and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff list s a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct includin g confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchan ge information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available t o FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

Comments Docket No RM In March a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market For example the Petition asserts Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing rather than accommodating transactions Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical accurate information across control areas This can take the form of outofdate or incorrect postings of ATC or in some instances intentional withholding of actual ATC Regardless of the cause more transmission capability Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference Docket No RM July transcript at Id at The group consists of a number of power marketers and users including for example Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market ELCON Electric Clearinghouse Inc and Enron Power Marketing Inc Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain OpenAccess Commercial Practices Docket No RM Docket No RM is physically available than is being released for sale The Petition alleges the existence of ATC exclusions inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities and therefore prevent reasonable access to the grid The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale EPSA the trade association representing certain power suppliers filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers by for example minimizing reported available transmission capability ATC delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS or otherwise manipulating market operations EPSA further stated that The manipulation of ATC whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS Petition at Id at Id at Appendix D EPSA Comments Docket No RM at filed September Docket No RM management is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Mississippi of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment Yazoo City as a participant has experienced first hand an individual transmission owners continued ability to use its ownership and control of transmission to disadvantage competitors notwithstanding Order s mandate of nondiscriminatory transmission access The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a MW power sale because of transmission restrictions but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself The representative concluded that Orders Nos and have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmissiondependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors Id at Comments of Robert D Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Regional ISO Conference New Orleans Transcript at After hearing this assertion Entergy Services Inc filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergyimposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase See Letter in Docket No PL filed July Docket No RM One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin CBM Although there is no single accepted definition CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC There is no uniform method for calculating CBM The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission For example with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pools historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is NERC Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations June at The Commission recently noticed a technical conference to be held May and on the issue of CBM See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity Notice of Technical Conference Docket No EL Docket No RM consistent with our open access policies The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending In another pending proceeding concerning WPSCs CBM calculation two of the parties assert that CBM removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition and fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBMrelated transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC In the same proceeding Electric Clearinghouse Inc asserts that the CBM setaside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users As we stated above we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made PJM FERC at Protest of Madison Gas Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc Docket No EL at filed August Protest of Electric Clearinghouse Inc Docket No EL at filed August Docket No RM findings They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission

marketers cannot sell above cap and generators must be subject to cost filings if they do and the result is black outs Alan Tuesday July Copyright Las Vegas ReviewJournal POWER SHORTAGES LV valley endures blackouts Utility officials expect supplies to stay tight as hot weather continues this week By JOHN G EDWARDS REVIEWJOURNAL The first rolling blackouts in Southern Nevada history hit the Las Vegas Valley on Monday with a speed that surprised even Nevada Power Co The utility company declared a red alert and initiated rolling blackouts that left an estimated customers without power It had reported customers were affected but later revised the number of customers who lost electricity The blackouts started at pm and ended at pm the utility said Nevada Power attributed the power shortages to several factors unusually high temperatures for this time of year three generation unit outages the areas rapid growth power shortages in California and possibly the wholesale power price caps that federal regulators imposed last month What killed us was the temperature was unbelievable said Paul Heagan vice president of Sierra Pacific Resources the holding company for Nevada Power The Las Vegas temperature soared to a nearrecord degrees As for the rest of the week power supply is going to be tight Heagan said The prospects this week are kind of tough to call The company logged record demand for power megawatts at pm Monday The previous alltime high was megawatts on Aug A megawatt is roughly the amount of power needed to supply houses By contrast on July last year the utility hit megawatts when the temperature was degrees Heagan said The company targeted nonemergency areas for Mondays rolling blackouts which affected mostly residential customers Nevada Power spokesmen declined to identify the affected areas even after the emergency was over Witnesses said power went out in one area of the Northwest and one area of the east valley Electricity customers in the affected areas said the blackouts lasted between and minutes Several traffic signals went out including those at the intersections of Buffalo Drive and Lake Mead Boulevard Tenaya Way and Lake Mead and Boulder Highway at US Highway Las Vegas Police Department officials reported few traffic problems because of the blackouts For the most part people reported few problems We only had a few customers and we couldnt do Western Union transactions without a computer but with the other customers we just winged it said Michelle Hitt a customer service representative at Mail Boxes Etc W Lake Mead Blvd Hitt said power at his store was out about minutes Across the street an assistant manager for the Vons supermarket at W Lake Mead Blvd said customers could not check out when the stores power turned off The Roadhouse Grill at Lake Mead Boulevard and Tenaya Way was shut down for about minutes shortly after pm restaurant manager Kim Tuerk said We had to evacuate the building because of health department and fire codes but it was no big deal he said Heagan said Nevada Power will start its rolling blackouts in other areas of the valley if it needs to cut power again this week The utilitys policy calls for no notification to areas that will lose power unlike California where a minimum of hours notice is required Nevada Power fears that notification would be used by burglars to locate unoccupied houses during the emergency Tim Hay state consumer advocate said he thinks customers in affected areas should be notified of possible outages They need to provide notice to affected areas at least in general areas to help people prepare Hay said Elsewhere in the valley consumers and businesses continued operating normally during the emergency Meadows mall General Manager Frank Wheat said power was not affected at the shopping center We know rolling blackouts can occur he said We do have backup generators for emergency lighting during hours of darkness but not for all the stores Spokespeople at University Medical Center and Sunrise Hospital also said they were not affected by Mondays blackouts and have their own backup power supplies Minta Albietz vice president of maternalchild services at Sunrise We have our own little power plant in the back We can generate our own power for days longer as long as we have fuel The company said its power woes began Friday when it internally declared a yellow alert and warned employees that it was running short of power Heagan said On Friday Nevada Power customers were pulling down megawatts the second or thirdhighest peak in the company history he said Meanwhile one of Nevada Powers electrical generation units at the Reid Gardner site miles north of Las Vegas has been down since Friday because of a leaking boiler he said Also Southern California Edison which operates the Mohave Generating Station at Laughlin for several utilities notified the company Friday that two of Nevada Powers units were down Nevada Power said it was able to obtain additional power on the spot market and avoid blackouts last week and did not need to seek any power use curtailment by major users The yellow alert continued through the weekend a period when electric consumption usually declines because businesses are closed and many people are driving around The company made arrangements to buy another megawatts of electricity Monday when most businesses reopened That got eaten up by early afternoon Heagan said The utility said casinos reduced about megawatts by switching to backup generators and starting conservation measures But several Strip casino operators said they received no requests to conserve power or to turn on their backup generation units Nevada Power hasnt asked us to shed power load said Debbie Munch Park Place Entertainment spokeswoman They asked us to cut our power usage a couple of times last summer and we did so If they do ask us well do what we can to help the community Mandalay Resort Group and MGM Mirage executives said they were not asked to cut their power use Monday Our facilities guys said nobodys asked us for anything and we havent done anything said Fred Lewis Aladdin spokesman At first glance it appears the problem was handled very well said Don Soderberg chairman of the Public Utilities Commission which regulates Nevada Power Its always hard to predict when were going to have abnormal temperatures and power plants are going to go offline Soderberg said The situation he added underlines the need to build more power plants Mondays degree high was one degree shy of the record for the date The heat follows the warmest May on record said Joe Nemeth a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service Temperatures are expected to stay warm but tapering off as the week progresses and the risk for thunderstorms increases meteorologists reported Highs will stay in the tripledigit range but drop to degrees today on Wednesday on Thursday and on Friday A less than percent chance for rain exists today a chance that increases to percent Wednesday Forecasters expect a to percent chance of rain the rest of the week This story is located at

forwarded you the petition last week for you to send to Miriam Erickson I thought she may be interested in this Forwarded by Christi L NicolayHOUECT on PM Linda L ES PM To Christi L CT cc Subject NOPR Comments Docket No RM In March a group referring to themselves as power industry stakeholders filed a petition for rulemaking on electric power industry structure Although we are not addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that Petition the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific allegations indicating problems in the market For example the Petition asserts Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles for obstructing and curtailing rather than accommodating transactions Incumbents are able to deny new entrants access to critical accurate information across control areas This can take the form of outofdate or incorrect postings of ATC or in some instances intentional withholding of actual ATC Regardless of the cause more transmission capability Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference Docket No RM July transcript at Id at The group consists of a number of power marketers and users including for example Coalition for a Competitive Electric Market ELCON Electric Clearinghouse Inc and Enron Power Marketing Inc Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or Reconsider Certain OpenAccess Commercial Practices Docket No RM Docket No RM is physically available than is being released for sale The Petition alleges the existence of ATC exclusions inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to evaluate market opportunities and therefore prevent reasonable access to the grid The Petition cited specific instances of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by the systems on either side an OASIS showing ATC that was not in fact made available for scheduling and an OASIS showing no ATC but the utility then using that path for a sale EPSA the trade association representing certain power suppliers filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed many of the same experiences EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists principally because of the continuing incentives and opportunity for transmission owning public utilities covertly to discriminate against other transmission customers by for example minimizing reported available transmission capability ATC delaying or inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS or otherwise manipulating market operations EPSA further stated that The manipulation of ATC whether with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS Petition at Id at Id at Appendix D EPSA Comments Docket No RM at filed September Docket No RM management is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power suppliers At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans we were told by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Mississippi of a specific instance of what it considered to be discriminatory treatment Yazoo City as a participant has experienced first hand an individual transmission owners continued ability to use its ownership and control of transmission to disadvantage competitors notwithstanding Order s mandate of nondiscriminatory transmission access The representative then went on to describe an instance where a marketer could not complete a MW power sale because of transmission restrictions but then the transmission provider offered to supply the capacity itself The representative concluded that Orders Nos and have not fully eliminated undue discrimination and this will not be achieved as long as transmission owners are allowed to fence in transmissiondependent utilities and others located on their transmission system to enhance the value of their generation assets at increased cost to competitors Id at Comments of Robert D Priest on behalf of the Public Service Commission of Yazoo City Regional ISO Conference New Orleans Transcript at After hearing this assertion Entergy Services Inc filed a letter in which it stated that it was unable to identify any Entergyimposed restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase See Letter in Docket No PL filed July Docket No RM One specific area where there have been allegations that transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit Margin CBM Although there is no single accepted definition CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation reliability requirements Some utilities subtract CBM from their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC There is no uniform method for calculating CBM The ability to withhold CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability advantage for the transmission provider but may give the transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC over paths and interconnections useful to its generation competitors The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being considered in several cases pending before the Commission For example with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO the Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pools historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is NERC Available Transfer Capability Definitions and Determinations June at The Commission recently noticed a technical conference to be held May and on the issue of CBM See Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission Capacity Notice of Technical Conference Docket No EL Docket No RM consistent with our open access policies The Commission observed that the load serving entities that own generating capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load serving entities The Commission set the issue for further briefing and it remains pending In another pending proceeding concerning WPSCs CBM calculation two of the parties assert that CBM removes firm transmission capacity from open access offerings thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable barrier to competition and fosters discrimination by giving merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBMrelated transmission access and by giving individual interface transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM is withdrawn from ATC In the same proceeding Electric Clearinghouse Inc asserts that the CBM setaside embodies undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of other firm transmission users As we stated above we fully recognize that these are assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made PJM FERC at Protest of Madison Gas Electric Company and Wisconsin Public Power Inc Docket No EL at filed August Protest of Electric Clearinghouse Inc Docket No EL at filed August Docket No RM findings They are referenced here as illustrative of the suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain competitors where generation owners continue to operate transmission

includes some dings against TVA On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion

incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for

LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer

on PM To Christi L Nicolay James D Steffes cc Tabors Richard Joe Hartsoe Richard Shapiro Steven J Kean Rob Bradley Subject RE Dan Larcamp request Christi Jim et al This last exchange has been very helpful The question that we need some guidance on is how detailed he wants these answers and what he will do with the results There are at least two levels that we could look at effectively Fairly quickly a repeat of the analysis done in the summer of when we looked at the price spikes in the midwest It would need to focus on San Diego since that seems to be where the price problem is today along with the midwest and also get a glimmer on rumor picked up here the impact of CA price spikes on Oregon consumers The conclusion from was that price spikes are necessary to send investment price signals for both generation additions and for DSM investments load response Presumably this would carry forward to a study A more careful look at the same areas described above but more focused on how the wholesale prices find their way to end use consumers WE covered this only in a cursory fashion in Here we would need to do two things The first is make certain that Dan and the FERC senior folks understand the basics that the price spikes in the midwest and in the other bilateral markets only affect the incremental transactions the lesson of not all kWh This is different from price spikes in the pool markets where they set the price for all kWh The second point is to see that there is an understanding of the role of a forward market and a hedge ie that you could look on EOL and buy forward a x for the summer say and pay a market price to protect you against the volatility on an hourly basis by absorbing it in a month contract The price signal for investment conclusion would carry forward as above What do you think the level of interest need is and how quickly does he need some or all of the answers This is a good time for TCA to tackle this We have or had a quiet moment

to learn what the problems are and to educate his staff In that regard we have offered to have some of his staff down to use some of Enrons tools He was specifically asking for the data below to counter the bent at FERC for price caps I didnt get a feeling that he would use the data to say that everything is fine In fact we took him through some parking examples and he asked that we hold a seminar type activity for some of his senior staffers He is in the process of bringing on some staffers that can act agressively on hotline issues etc He was very familiar with the other problems on the grid He also asked Kevin why Enron doesnt want LMP everywhere because with our staffing we can run over everyone else Kevin told him that then there is no market liquidity and we cant trade with ourselves As it is now there are less than big players due to the transmission risk We explained in detail what happens in the Into Markets and why it is so difficult to deal with transmissionphysical

energy bill versus next year total energy bill Competitive generation is also about risk transfer regulated monopolies assign all new plant risk to customers merchant generation assigns all new plant

comprehensive real price study using data from last summer or the last two summers showing how much on a kw basis that retail customers were affected by the price spikes including how much they saved

LEAD BY SCO TT MILLER WHO REPORTS TO DAN LARCAMP BOTH WILL JOIN THE ENRON EXECUTIVES AT LUNCH THURS MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES On FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss ed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme nt for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Sta ff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p ro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simp ly relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and import s and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as we ll as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi cs similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic e to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lac k of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan ts to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commissi on has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat I n addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase d loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants belie ve that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of informati on in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules fo r service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a nd protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk advers e eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted th at because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp er implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however al l three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM Th e result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC aud it this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several are as of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flo w input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission coul d benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t he TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to ha ve the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha ve against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation d ue to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has act ed as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th is summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S E including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigatio n found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac k of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communicati on are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase rais es the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv e operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d o not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions i e treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio n of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal la w and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff list s a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct includin g confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchan ge information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available t o FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

of growing energy sh ortages the new plants are part of a power clash that presents the Bush ad ministration and federal and state regulators with one of their knottiest p roblems Who controls the nations power grid On one side is a new breed o f freewheeling energy dealers called merchant traders spurred by deregulat ion to generate and trade electricity Led here by Enron Corp they build small gasfired generating plants but most dont construct their own powe r lines Instead they hook up the plants to existing lines and sell electr icity wholesale over long distances when prices peak during the summer Thu s many of their plants are called peakers On the other side are oldlin e utilities represented here by the federally owned Tennessee Valley Autho rity They operate the power lines and warn that the system could become ov erloaded leading to blackouts from the imbalance Near Nutbush here in Ten nessees southwest corner naturalgas pipelines run from the Gulf Coast an d intersect with some of the TVAs miles of transmission lines whic h are spread over seven Southern states That is what is making Nutbush boo m It is an attractive place to connect to the grid By at least new merchant plants altogether will be hooked up across the TVAs system T here will be dozens more on neighboring systems that will also use TVA line s says W Terry Boston a TVA executive vice president This year TVA exp ects requests for wholesale power deals on its system up from last year and just in Mr Boston foresees a congestion pro blem that will make it more difficult for the utility to maintain its recor d of reliability This summer is going to be interesting he says Co mbat started here in the spring of when an Enron plant at nearby Brow nsville began bombarding TVA with about requests for summer transmissio n service up from the TVA had received from merchant plants the year be fore Some were huge elaborate trades involving brokered electricity from other sources that Enron wanted to ship across the TVA system Kevin Presto an Enron vice president recalled The TVA pretty much fought us the who le way even though they needed the megawatts That June TVA pulled the p lug telling Enron that from then on its wheeling and dealing would be con fined to the amount of electricity produced in Enron plants Enron claimed foul and appealed to the North American Electric Reliability Council or NE RC a voluntary organization of utilities and electricity consumers Along with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state regulators NERC f unctions as the traffic cop for North Americas power grid Enron also sued the TVA and the dispute raised a number of issues that we are trying to p ut our fingers on says Don Benjamin NERCs director of operations One u pshot is that it is busy rewriting the rules for how the national grid is c ontrolled The Bush administrations energy task force and Congress are als o looking at the control issue and ways to expand the grids capacity So f ar they have found no easy or inexpensive answers The grid with its den se webs surrounding major cities and few links in between resembles a US highway map from the s before the Interstate system was built And it is governed by rules that were negotiated by utilities at about that time as they began to interconnect their systems with their neighbors Big util ities became control areas that perform the momenttomoment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment from melting down With elec tricity supply must always match demand But lately operators of merchant plants such as Enron have also qualified to become control areas Regula tors have ordered utilities to give merchant power plants open access to th e grid though the utilities sometimes curtail access for reliability rea sons This was a very good system sighs Thomas Overbye an engineering p rofessor at the University of Illinois But while merchant plants have more access to the grid he notes they have little incentive to build more pow er lines When you restructure that way asserts Mr Overbye Youre goi ng to overload the system and thats exactly whats happening NERCs Mr Benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer Weve got to b e able to look at this and see what effects these deals are having on the w hole system he says Some ad hoc curtailment of wholesale deals and servi ce to customers may be necessary to protect the grid but the result will b e expensive he notes It means that merchants wont make money on that de al and that the customer they sold power to will have to buy it from someb ody else In the summer of there were such curtailments last summ er there were Lynn Church president of the Electric Power Supply Asso ciation which represents merchant power companies and electricity trade rs suspects that decisions taken by big utilities for reliability reason s are sometimes used to block legitimate competition from her members To p revent this her group wants more federal control over the grid Were see ing lots of discrimination The TVAs Mr Boston counters that his system cant take more surprises such as the one on Aug when a serie s of wholesale trades brought the TVAs part of the grid to the brink of co llapse from the overload This year Enron settled its fight with the TVA w ith a secret outofcourt settlement Enron says it is also in the process of selling the plant near here and two others it had hooked to the TVA syst em to other merchant power producers But it is still waging war over who c ontrols the grid In a separate case now before the US Supreme Court Enr on argues that FERC has the power to open more of the grids capacity to me rchant power plants Utility commissioners from several states argue it doe snt While this is going on FERC is pondering how to cut back the grids proliferating number of control areas Right now there are about Accor ding to one FERC expert who asked not to be identified to avoid complica tions there should be around Meanwhile officials in Tina Turners hom e turf still want the power plant construction to keep on rocking Theres going to be others predicts John Sharpe the executive of Haywood County who has been out recruiting more power plants to keep the local economic boost going Im working my pants off to try and make that happen Write to John J Fialka at

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

CT Steve Van CT Jeffrey T CT cc James D nron Subject Interconnection Information Barbara Steve and JeffBelow is information I sent out last year as updated today dealing with some interconnection issues I look forward to working with you on interconnection and other power transmission issues Thanks Christi This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBa I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not necessary allowed under the new FERC rule because such costs should be charged when a separate request for transmission is made Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me FERC has approved some longer deadlines in certain utility specific filings There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC for example PJM NEPOOL VEPCO Ameren Entergy ComEd Arizona Pub Serv CPL FERC has issued orders in most of the filings An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Enrons Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not

Horizon is not subject to the Sch load imbalance penalties to the extent that its load is dynamically scheduled as long as the dynamic scheduling is successful even if the re are some imbalances during successful dynamic scheduling New Horizon is not a control area It is important to note that these provisions were included in New Horizons network operating agreement with Duke We can pu ll the New HorizonDuke contracts if necessary for language but need to include some language if Enron takes the service or alert our potential services customers to this requirement FERC did not discuss whether this same result would be applicable to generation imbalances that are dynamically scheduled but we would argue a similar result In addition FERC has stated that there cannot be double counting of the generation imbalance provision and the Sch load imbalanc e provision Forwarded by Christi L NicolayHOUECT on PM Linda L NRON PM Sent by Linda L NRON To Christi L CT cc Subject Re New Horizon FERC Order UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FERC F FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey and Linda Breathitt New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc v Docket No EL Duke Power Company ORDER ON REHEARING Issued February In response to a request for clarification or rehearing of our order issued in this proceeding on October New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc v Duke Power Company FERC F October Order we clarify that to the extent dynamic scheduling by New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc New Horizon operates successfully New Horizon should not be subject to charges under Dukes Schedule Energy Imbalance Service In such circumstances any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of New Horizon and New Horizons load should be accounted for by Duke as inadvertent interchanges only In addition we direct the parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation of dynamic scheduling BACKGROUND Our October Order addressed a complaint by New Horizon agains t Duke under section of the Federal Power Act seeking Commission resolution of four disputed issues including the treatment of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling New Horizons complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it since it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Dukes control area Further New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted inadvertent interchange energy which is the net difference between actual and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas and proposed that any differences would be returned inkind within two hours Duke agreed that energy imbalance does not apply to a transmission customer like New Horizon that electronically USC F e New Horizon requested fast track resolution of this issue F Docket No EL transfers its load from its control area via dynamic scheduling to the extent such load is in fact transferred However Duke asserted that New Horizon should be required to procure energy imbalance service from Duke to the extent dynamic scheduling fails and there is a mismatch between scheduled delivery of energy by New Horizon and the actual loads of New Horizon served by that energy In our October Order we found that in the absence of backup procedures a Duke customer that dynamically schedules its load is subject to Schedule Energy Imbalance Service under Dukes Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT if the customers dynamic scheduling syste m fails to effectively transfer its entire load out of Duke s control area We agreed with Duke that New Horizon should be subject to Dukes Schedule Energy Imbalance Service to the extent its dynamic scheduling model failed to remove its load from Dukes control area We disagreed with New Horizons contention that such mismatches constitute inadvertent energy and therefore should receive comparable or similar treatment as the mismatches between the net interchange schedules that exist between control areas In addition we agreed with Duke that if New Horizons load is not dynamically transferred it remains within Dukes control area and Dukes generators will respond automatically to mismatches between scheduled and actual energy to load In making these determinations we relied on our findings in American Electric Power Company FERC F AEP where we reviewed service agreements related to dynamically scheduling load for Blue Ridge Power Agency American Electric Power Service Corporations NITSA included provisions that stated that for such time as the customer successfully employs dynamic scheduling the provisions of Energy Imbalance Service Schedule will not apply However the agreement also provided that in the event of data outages the provisions of Schedule Energy Imbalance Service will also apply Consistent with the provisions in the AEP agreements we found that New Horizon is required to take Schedule Energy Imbalance Service from Duke or it must make alternative comparable arrangements to the extent dynamic scheduling is unsuccessful Duke Answer at FERC at FERC at F Docket No EL New Horizon seeks clarification or in the alternative rehearing of the Commissions October Order Duke filed an answer to New Horizons request for rehearing New Horizon filed a motion for leave to respond to Dukes answer and Duke filed an answer to New Horizons motion DISCUSSION Procedural Matters Pursuant to CFR F we will deny Dukes answer as an impermissible answer to a request for rehearing This being the case we will deny New Horizons response and Dukes response thereto as moot Request for Clarification or Rehearing New Horizon argues that there may be times when despite the successful operation of dynamic scheduling some mismatches between its load and energy deliveries would still result In these instances New Horizon argues it should not be subject to Duke s Schedule Energy Imbalance Service and that the mismatches should be accounted for as inadvertent interchanges as is customary between adjacent control areas Furthermore New Horizon requests that we require Duke to negotiate with it in good faith to establish a standard for successful operation of dynamic scheduling We agree with New Horizon that it is possible that some mismatches could result even during successful operation of dynamic scheduling In fact Duke and New Horizon agreed in their network operating agreement NOA that the dynamic scheduling information may not be percent accurate and also that this should not be a basis for penalties Duke may not file an answer to New Horizons rehearing request merely because New Horizon alternatively argued for clarification These mismatches are the result of the inherent differences between the actual metered load for an hour and the dynamic schedule value for the same hour created by integrating the four second dynamic scheduling signal values over the hour See NOA section g Original Sheet No We further note that section e of the NOA allows for the estimation of dynamic scheduling data and that the use of estimated data would not be a ground for a claim of unsuccessful operation of the dynamic scheduling arrangements or a claim for penalties F Docket No EL Mismatches that result during successful operation of dynamic scheduling if accounted for by Duke through Schedule Energy Imbalance Service would cause double recovery once through inadvertent interchange and again through Schedule Energy Imbalance Service charges Therefore we will require that mismatches that result during successful operation of dynamic scheduling be accounted for by Duke only through inadvertent interchange New Horizon should only be subject to Duke s Schedule Energy Imbalance Service during periods when New Horizon s dynamic scheduling fails to operate successfully We further agree with New Horizon that it is necessary to define what constitutes successful dynamic scheduling in order to then determine what should occur in the event that dynamic scheduling is not successful Accordingly we direct the parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for successful operation of dynamic scheduling and to incorporate this standard in the parties agreements and to file such changes with us The Commission orders New Horizons request for rehearing or clarification is hereby granted as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission S E A L Linwood A Watson

yet but many times there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency power to the interconnected transmission provider in which case you would want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to replace the energy at a different location usually it is difficult to get this agreement so you should check and then factor that into the equation I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting transmission It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission or use its network transmission when the Delivery Point is the plant Enron will have to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to supply at an alternate delivery point Please discuss this with Kevin Prestos tranmission people Bill Rust on Enron cannot use VEPCOs network transmission to delivery to third parties Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet Also FERC has issued some recent rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies etc While VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built you want to make sure that you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to transmission constraints A request for transmission on OASIS is the only way to ensure deliverability to third parties c Intraday schedulingYou may have hourly transmission risk for an increase Unless you buy longer term firm you will deliver from other sources using hourly nonfirm which is the lowest priority of transmission and subject to getting cut You may want to consider doing this on bestreasonable efforts basis Also even if you purchase dailymonthlyyearly firm to serve third parties if you change the point of receipt or point of delivery temporarily your request is treated as nonfirm Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO an RTO that has not been approved by FERC yetcompeting ISO to Midwest ISO but since FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet there could be significant changes in the transmission chargesmethods of obtaining transmissiongrandfathering of current transmission etc during this contract Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this outincrease in price covers that circumstance Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at most any time subject to the provider filing a rate case Therefore any current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this contract Generally transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates Tom Chapman PM To Christi L CT cc Subject VEPCO PPA Christi This is the note that I received on Tuesday June This is a relatively early draft of the PPA I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues IN addition in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up the regulatory process in the NCUC I think that this will make the issue less contentious because of the NCUCs acceptance of the Dynegy plant at Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline their only stumbling block was their gas agreeement They built a bypass off Transco We would be taking gas from the LDC of Rocky Mount Having talked with the regulatory folks at the NCUC who handle gas issues this is the preferred route So I do not think that we have any major state issues I think that right now we are simply working on some of the siting issues That being said I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or Jeff Keenan

Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO based on the current version of the term sheet In preparing the draft we did encounter several additional questions for Enrons consideration These are noted with brackets and in some cases italicized notes in the draft and are also highlighted below You may want to address these issues before this goes to VEPCO Cover and first page Should the party to the agreement for the moment be ENA or a special purpose company Definitions We included a defined term Emergency StartUp a start up or increase in energy scheduled during a day and a place in Exhibit A to include a price for this although this was not covered in the term sheet Section We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy energy charge only no demand chargedo you want this Section This was taken from the term sheet but is it correct that COD will be July since the demand charge is supposed to start June Also it would be best to define commencement of construction to avoid controversy down the road We could either do this now or put in a placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent whichever is your preference Also bear in mind that we have not included a specific remedy eg liquidated damages if the Seller does not achieve that milestone on time Under the default provision Section c there would be a day period to cure before Buyer could terminate extendible to days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the cure Would you prefer the right to pay lds and extend the time period Section b Should the hour limitation apply to all sales under this PPA or only sales from the Facility Ie would you use this Agreement to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the Facility Also is this a calendar year limitationie could they take hours in the period JuneDec or does the hours need to be prorated for the first year Section Since this is not a base load plant the normal definition of Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable Instead we stated that the Facility would be capable of being available of the year other than due to Force Majeure and hours weeks of scheduled maintenanceie that if they tried to schedule it it is expected to be available Is that what Enron intended Additionally the term sheet stated that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreedwhy wouldnt cost of cover damages be appropriate Also please note that we included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during peak periods Section b Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of Energy We have MW minimum blocks but the capacity is should we allow the last Block to be if theyve scheduled all the rest Section c Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section Section Should there a required minimum take of Energy Article The GencoSantee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not have any provisions on metering See placeholder note in Article Do you want to add such a provision ignore it or just include a placeholder for now Section Is days from invoice correct for the payment due date or would you prefer a shorter period Article The GencoSantee Cooper form had mediation as a required step prior to arbitration Should we keep that Also the form of arbitration is baseball arbitrationie the arbitrators have to chose one partys position or the others Is that what you want Section We used New York for governing law on the premise that it will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not recommend Virginia law for this contract Exhibit A There are a number of questions on the pricing

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

CT Steve Van CT Jeffrey T CT cc James D nron Subject Interconnection Information Barbara Steve and JeffBelow is information I sent out last year as updated today dealing with some interconnection issues I look forward to working with you on interconnection and other power transmission issues Thanks Christi This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBa I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not necessary allowed under the new FERC rule because such costs should be charged when a separate request for transmission is made Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me FERC has approved some longer deadlines in certain utility specific filings There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC for example PJM NEPOOL VEPCO Ameren Entergy ComEd Arizona Pub Serv CPL FERC has issued orders in most of the filings An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Enrons Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

is not subject to the Sch load imbalance penalties to the extent that its load is dynamically scheduled as long as the dynamic scheduling is successful even if the re are some imbalances during successful dynamic scheduling New Horizon is not a control area It is important to note that these provisions were included in New Horizons network operating agreement with Duke We can pu ll the New HorizonDuke contracts if necessary for language but need to include some language if Enron takes the service or alert our potential services customers to this requirement FERC did not discuss whether this same result would be applicable to generation imbalances that are dynamically scheduled but we would argue a similar result In addition FERC has stated that there cannot be double counting of the generation imbalance provision and the Sch load imbalanc e provision Forwarded by Christi L NicolayHOUECT on PM Linda L NRON PM Sent by Linda L NRON To Christi L CT cc Subject Re New Horizon FERC Order UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FERC F FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey and Linda Breathitt New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc v Docket No EL Duke Power Company ORDER ON REHEARING Issued February In response to a request for clarification or rehearing of our order issued in this proceeding on October New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc v Duke Power Company FERC F October Order we clarify that to the extent dynamic scheduling by New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc New Horizon operates successfully New Horizon should not be subject to charges under Dukes Schedule Energy Imbalance Service In such circumstances any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of New Horizon and New Horizons load should be accounted for by Duke as inadvertent interchanges only In addition we direct the parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation of dynamic scheduling BACKGROUND Our October Order addressed a complaint by New Horizon agains t Duke under section of the Federal Power Act seeking Commission resolution of four disputed issues including the treatment of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling New Horizons complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it since it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Dukes control area Further New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted inadvertent interchange energy which is the net difference between actual and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas and proposed that any differences would be returned inkind within two hours Duke agreed that energy imbalance does not apply to a transmission customer like New Horizon that electronically USC F e New Horizon requested fast track resolution of this issue F Docket No EL transfers its load from its control area via dynamic scheduling to the extent such load is in fact transferred However Duke asserted that New Horizon should be required to procure energy imbalance service from Duke to the extent dynamic scheduling fails and there is a mismatch between scheduled delivery of energy by New Horizon and the actual loads of New Horizon served by that energy In our October Order we found that in the absence of backup procedures a Duke customer that dynamically schedules its load is subject to Schedule Energy Imbalance Service under Dukes Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT if the customers dynamic scheduling syste m fails to effectively transfer its entire load out of Duke s control area We agreed with Duke that New Horizon should be subject to Dukes Schedule Energy Imbalance Service to the extent its dynamic scheduling model failed to remove its load from Dukes control area We disagreed with New Horizons contention that such mismatches constitute inadvertent energy and therefore should receive comparable or similar treatment as the mismatches between the net interchange schedules that exist between control areas In addition we agreed with Duke that if New Horizons load is not dynamically transferred it remains within Dukes control area and Dukes generators will respond automatically to mismatches between scheduled and actual energy to load In making these determinations we relied on our findings in American Electric Power Company FERC F AEP where we reviewed service agreements related to dynamically scheduling load for Blue Ridge Power Agency American Electric Power Service Corporations NITSA included provisions that stated that for such time as the customer successfully employs dynamic scheduling the provisions of Energy Imbalance Service Schedule will not apply However the agreement also provided that in the event of data outages the provisions of Schedule Energy Imbalance Service will also apply Consistent with the provisions in the AEP agreements we found that New Horizon is required to take Schedule Energy Imbalance Service from Duke or it must make alternative comparable arrangements to the extent dynamic scheduling is unsuccessful Duke Answer at FERC at FERC at F Docket No EL New Horizon seeks clarification or in the alternative rehearing of the Commissions October Order Duke filed an answer to New Horizons request for rehearing New Horizon filed a motion for leave to respond to Dukes answer and Duke filed an answer to New Horizons motion DISCUSSION Procedural Matters Pursuant to CFR F we will deny Dukes answer as an impermissible answer to a request for rehearing This being the case we will deny New Horizons response and Dukes response thereto as moot Request for Clarification or Rehearing New Horizon argues that there may be times when despite the successful operation of dynamic scheduling some mismatches between its load and energy deliveries would still result In these instances New Horizon argues it should not be subject to Duke s Schedule Energy Imbalance Service and that the mismatches should be accounted for as inadvertent interchanges as is customary between adjacent control areas Furthermore New Horizon requests that we require Duke to negotiate with it in good faith to establish a standard for successful operation of dynamic scheduling We agree with New Horizon that it is possible that some mismatches could result even during successful operation of dynamic scheduling In fact Duke and New Horizon agreed in their network operating agreement NOA that the dynamic scheduling information may not be percent accurate and also that this should not be a basis for penalties Duke may not file an answer to New Horizons rehearing request merely because New Horizon alternatively argued for clarification These mismatches are the result of the inherent differences between the actual metered load for an hour and the dynamic schedule value for the same hour created by integrating the four second dynamic scheduling signal values over the hour See NOA section g Original Sheet No We further note that section e of the NOA allows for the estimation of dynamic scheduling data and that the use of estimated data would not be a ground for a claim of unsuccessful operation of the dynamic scheduling arrangements or a claim for penalties F Docket No EL Mismatches that result during successful operation of dynamic scheduling if accounted for by Duke through Schedule Energy Imbalance Service would cause double recovery once through inadvertent interchange and again through Schedule Energy Imbalance Service charges Therefore we will require that mismatches that result during successful operation of dynamic scheduling be accounted for by Duke only through inadvertent interchange New Horizon should only be subject to Duke s Schedule Energy Imbalance Service during periods when New Horizon s dynamic scheduling fails to operate successfully We further agree with New Horizon that it is necessary to define what constitutes successful dynamic scheduling in order to then determine what should occur in the event that dynamic scheduling is not successful Accordingly we direct the parties to negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for successful operation of dynamic scheduling and to incorporate this standard in the parties agreements and to file such changes with us The Commission orders New Horizons request for rehearing or clarification is hereby granted as discussed in the body of this order By the Commission S E A L Linwood A Watson

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

CT Steve Van CT Jeffrey T CT cc James D nron Subject Interconnection Information Barbara Steve and JeffBelow is information I sent out last year as updated today dealing with some interconnection issues I look forward to working with you on interconnection and other power transmission issues Thanks Christi This is a brief primer to assist you with current policy regarding interconnecting generation plants in the East Please forward this to your groups Thanks Christi Nicolay EBa I am available for your federalFERC regulatory questions and can point you to the correct stateregional regulatory people When initially deciding where to site a plant there are several federal regulatory issues to consider First you will need to obtain the utilitys interconnection policy and a pro forma interconnection agreement from the utility For most utilities you will need to call them to obtain their policy and agreement Some utilities have this available on their OASIS computer site or web page The OASIS sites have areas that do not require a password but if the information is not available in that area you should contact the power trading desk transmission personnel to assist in locating the information If a utility says it does not have a policy you can let me know The interconnection procedures typically require you to send in a request for the utility to study the interconnection Typically app When you return the money and the request which is usually an agreement that must be initialled by ENA legal the project will be placed in the queue The queue is usually available on the OASIS If the utility does not post the queue let me know Many times the procedures require the project to meet milestones in order to remain in the queue If the milestones look unreasonable let me know FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently issued an order Tennessee Power case in which FERC stated that asking for interconnection is separate from a request for transmission under a utilitys Open Access Transmission Tariff OATT Enron and others had lobbied FERC to issue an order dealing with interconnection Many utilities will try to charge additional network upgrade costs not simply the costs to interconnect This is not necessary allowed under the new FERC rule because such costs should be charged when a separate request for transmission is made Note PJM and NEPOOL have different rules due to their pool structure In addition in the Tennessee Power case FERC stated that utilities are required to abide by certain timelines during the interconnection study process Generally these timelines are in the attachment below Most of the interconnection policies I have seen have timelines significantly longer than what FERC is now requiring You should probably first call the utility to ask if they are planning to revise the deadlines to comply with FERCs new order If that doesnt work you can call me FERC has approved some longer deadlines in certain utility specific filings There are several utilities that have filed their interconnection procedures at FERC for example PJM NEPOOL VEPCO Ameren Entergy ComEd Arizona Pub Serv CPL FERC has issued orders in most of the filings An ENA attorney must sign off on the interconnection agreement Generally I review the interconnection agreement from a regulatory perspective It is important to have someone in Enrons Genco review it if Enron will own or operate it after inservice or if EPMI plans to purchase power from the plant The interconnection agreement usually contains operational provisions including imbalance provisions that are typically very one sided toward the utility so it is important to have Enron technical input before the agreement is executed Asking for interconnection and getting in a queue is not a request for transmission You should consult the power trading desk transmission people in order to determine whether a request for firm or nonfirm transmission needs to be made The desk can make the request if necessary While the desk may choose to use dailyhourly nonfirm transmission for some of the Enron plants the decision is made on a casebycase basis You do not want your plant to be stranded without the ability to wheel electricity away from the busbar unless you are building a plant in order to sell power directly to the interconnected utility and even then you may want to wheel power around at times If the utility does not have enough transmission capability to wheel power from the plant the plantEnron may have to pay network upgrades You want to make sure that you are reserving transmission on a firm priority basis if you pay for network upgrades Some utilities simply provide transmission credits when requiring network upgrades These are not as valuable to Enron because there may be no opportunity to ever wheel the power if Enron doesnt have a reservation for the transmission The Eastern interconnection is prone to curtailments of transmission called TLRs especially in the summer The Power Trading desk can assist in obtaining the transmission In order to sell power to the grid the plant must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subjects the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC These generally must be filed at least days before the plant will start producing any power The filings take several weeks to prepare Do not assume that you can sell ancillary services from the plant The plant may not be able to sell ancillary services into the market EPMI has the FERC authorization to sell certain ancillary services in California and NEPOOL but EPMI cannot at this time sell in other areas absent a FERC filing and setting up an OASIS web page Be aware that many utilities add language in their interconnection agreements that allow them to take the ancillary services from your plant without compensation If you are dealing with an industrial that has a plant onsite additional issues are involved You can check on the Enron home page under Sites Intranet Government Affairs State Restructuring Reports for information on the status of retail open access in that state If you need additional assistance contact Elizabeth Linnell Generally the state must have retail open access in order for Enron to sell power to a plant In order for an onsite plant to sell power to the grid it must apply to FERC for Exempt Wholesale Generator EWG status and also obtain a FERC Power Marketer license with Market Based Rates These filings make the onsite generator a utility for FERC purposes and subject the power marketer to periodic filings at FERC Because some industrials may not want to be FERC regulated ENA may be able to use a Special Purpose Vehicle SPV so that ENA may own part of the generator There are also options to establish a Qualified Facility QF that sells power to the interconnected utility The interconnected utility may also have a program in which it purchases excess power from the onsite plant Please contact Bob Frank for help on possible regulatory structures There may also be issues if the plant is connecting to a lower voltage line such as a kv or kv Some utilties have filed to put these lines into their distribution systems rather than in the wholesale transmission system which may take them out of FERC jurisdiction for wheeling purposes We have not fully examined this type of situation but can if necessary There are other regulatory issues such as site permitting political assistance environmental permits that must also be addressed The regional regulatory people in Rick Shapiros government affairs group can assist you

<20427693.1075846132182.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,christi.nicolay@enron.com,2000-06-15 10:41:00,Re VEPCO PPAthoughts from federal regtransmission side I havent worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet but many times there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency power to the interconnected transmission provider in which case you would want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to replace the energy at a different location usually it is difficult to get this agreement so you should check and then factor that into the equation I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting transmission It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission or use its network transmission when the Delivery Point is the plant Enron will have to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to supply at an alternate delivery point Please discuss this with Kevin Prestos tranmission people Bill Rust on Enron cannot use VEPCOs network transmission to delivery to third parties Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet Also FERC has issued some recent rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies etc While VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built you want to make sure that you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to transmission constraints A request for transmission on OASIS is the only way to ensure deliverability to third parties c Intraday schedulingYou may have hourly transmission risk for an increase Unless you buy longer term firm you will deliver from other sources using hourly nonfirm which is the lowest priority of transmission and subject to getting cut You may want to consider doing this on bestreasonable efforts basis Also even if you purchase dailymonthlyyearly firm to serve third parties if you change the point of receipt or point of delivery temporarily your request is treated as nonfirm Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO an RTO that has not been approved by FERC yetcompeting ISO to Midwest ISO but since FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet there could be significant changes in the transmission chargesmethods of obtaining transmissiongrandfathering of current transmission etc during this contract Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this outincrease in price covers that circumstance Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at most any time subject to the provider filing a rate case Therefore any current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this contract Generally transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates Tom Chapman PM To Christi L CT cc Subject VEPCO PPA Christi This is the note that I received on Tuesday June This is a relatively early draft of the PPA I think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and do the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues IN addition in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up the regulatory process in the NCUC I think that this will make the issue less contentious because of the NCUCs acceptance of the Dynegy plant at Rockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power Using the Dynegy plant as a guideline their only stumbling block was their gas agreeement They built a bypass off Transco We would be taking gas from the LDC of Rocky Mount Having talked with the regulatory folks at the NCUC who handle gas issues this is the preferred route So I do not think that we have any major state issues I think that right now we are simply working on some of the siting issues That being said I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or Jeff Keenan or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan if you think that there are some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level Thanks Tom Forwarded by Tom

VEPCO PPA Lisa Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO based on the current version of the term sheet In preparing the draft we did encounter several additional questions for Enrons consideration These are noted with brackets and in some cases italicized notes in the draft and are also highlighted below You may want to address these issues before this goes to VEPCO Cover and first page Should the party to the agreement for the moment be ENA or a special purpose company Definitions We included a defined term Emergency StartUp a start up or increase in energy scheduled during a day and a place in Exhibit A to include a price for this although this was not covered in the term sheet Section We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy energy charge only no demand chargedo you want this Section This was taken from the term sheet but is it correct that COD will be July since the demand charge is supposed to start June Also it would be best to define commencement of construction to avoid controversy down the road We could either do this now or put in a placeholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent whichever is your preference Also bear in mind that we have not included a specific remedy eg liquidated damages if the Seller does not achieve that milestone on time Under the default provision Section c there would be a day period to cure before Buyer could terminate extendible to days if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the cure Would you prefer the right to pay lds and extend the time period Section b Should the hour limitation apply to all sales under this PPA or only sales from the Facility Ie would you use this Agreement to sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the Facility Also is this a calendar year limitationie could they take hours in the period JuneDec or does the hours need to be prorated for the first year Section Since this is not a base load plant the normal definition of Availability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the total hours in the year would not seem to be applicable Instead we stated that the Facility would be capable of being available of the year other than due to Force Majeure and hours weeks of scheduled maintenanceie that if they tried to schedule it it is expected to be available Is that what Enron intended Additionally the term sheet stated that a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreedwhy wouldnt cost of cover damages be appropriate Also please note that we included language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during peak periods Section b Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of Energy We have MW minimum blocks but the capacity is should we allow the last Block to be if theyve scheduled all the rest Section c Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section Section Should there a required minimum take of Energy Article The GencoSantee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not have any provisions on metering See placeholder note in Article Do you want to add such a provision ignore it or just include a placeholder for now Section Is days from invoice correct for the payment due date or would you prefer a shorter period Article The GencoSantee Cooper form had mediation as a required step prior to arbitration Should we keep that Also the form of arbitration is baseball arbitrationie the arbitrators have to chose one partys position or the others Is that what you want Section We used New York for governing law on the premise that it will be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not recommend Virginia law for this contract Exhibit A There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibitplease see the bracketed notes therein Please call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft VEPPPADOC

James D nron Richard ES Joe nron Subject Re Draft Questions for Hoecker TomFor your background information for Senator Gordonyou will need to edit out the information on the part Enron played but I thought you would want the entire picture Until the Tennessee Power case issued in March most utilities considered interconnection issues and procedures to be within their discretion The only FERC approved policies were in PJM and NEPOOL These policies are fairly idiosyncratic to those pools Since Enron began siting merchant generation with our peaking plants in TVA we had told FERC that there were problems in getting utilities to be responsive The main problem was failure to provide study results in a timely manner I think it is important to note that merchant facilities are a fairly new idea They are not ratebased and have no guaranteed return paid for directly by retail customers except perhaps to the extent that a utility signs a deal to purchase capacity andor energy from the merchant Plus I think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate d structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants les s supply TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY FERC issued an order o n clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues The order is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enrons membership in t he Electric Power Supply Association EPSA In midJanuary EPSA arranged allday meetings for Sarah Novosel Enron an d other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss interconnection issues Fourteen EPSA membercompanies were represented at these meetings and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate interconnection agreements with utilities We urged the Commission to at a minimum develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating interconnection agreements less time consuming and more evenhanded The Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for interconnection and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no t abide by the procedures for interconnection requests In the Tenn Power order that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee Power Co against Central Illinois which FERC dismissed FERC clarifies that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests apply equally to interconnection requests Furthermore FERC states that a utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission service along with its request for interconnection service stating that these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests and then the utility insists on performing costly and timeconsuming system impact studies for the transmission service even if the generator does not want the transmission service By applying the pro forma tariff procedure s to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept interconnection requests without transmission service requests FERC is eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities FERC also states that if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates terms or conditions of the interconnection the transmission customer may direct the utility to file within days an unexecuted agreement with FERC FERC will then have days to determine the just and reasonable rates ter ms and conditions for the interconnection service During the FERC agenda meeting on Commissioner Massey was very please d with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry with needed guidance Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac h develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all generators requesting interconnection service and he also encouraged the industry to work together to develop an industrywide pro forma interconnection agreement EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma interconnection agreement so Commissioner Masseys comments could encourag e the utility sector to begin negotiating an industrywide standardized agreement However even without a standardized agreement we hoped that FERCs order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by utilities to delay sometimes indefinitely the citing of new generation TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING TECO made a FERC filing to require minute by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission system EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing Befor e an order was issued somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC TECO withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations At this time FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create a standard generator imbalance schedule for the OATT FERC has said it wou ld review the filings on a case by case basis FERC has not required utilitie s to file imbalance schedules it encourages them to do so At this time only Entergy SOCO TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance provisions as amendments to their OATTs Most utilities require this to be negotiated not much room for negotiation in the interconnection agreements While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the y can be filed unsigned and then protested this can be an impractical solution when building a peaker in less than one year such as Enron has done A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo re friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero us in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING On Entergy filed a proposed interconnection policy and procedure at FERC EPMI protested various aspec ts and we assisted EPSA on its protest Before the order was issued again fairly unprecedented Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos ed interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to protests Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this filing Entergy agreed to change Defines required system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect EPMI and EPSA issue Required are those such as resulting from the Short CircuitBreaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysislik e circuit breakers relaying devices system protection equipment Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when in service did not go as far as EPMI argued that we should not be required to provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have to cut our deal Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives Adopted EPMIs proposed Emergency language that loss of Entergys generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for nonemergencies except when complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER C or SERC or reg agency EPMI issue Changed force majeure language to match OATT Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short CircuitBreaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an interconnection agreement is signed although the generation projects will remain in the queue This can cause the costs to vary from the st estimat e to time of actual interconnection On FERC issued an order accepting Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement IA and procedures subject to modification A s I mentioned above Entergy had adopted some of EPMIs suggestion in EPMIs comments including limiting emergencies to not include Entergys loss of generation All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS it is not included with an interconnection request Entergys interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale as well as unbundled retail Dismisses EPSAs call for a model and approves Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement subject to modificationThe Commission stated EPSA Dynegy and PGE argue that the Commission should initiate a generic proceeding or industry collaborative to address interconnection concernsThe Commission declines at this time to issue a policy statemen t or convene a industry collarboration to establish standardized IPs Interconnection Procedures and IAs Interconnection Agreements With respect to IPs the Commissions recent findings in Tenn Power amplify the Commissions findings in Order No which established standard procedur es for obtaining transmission service It is our belief that no additional standardized procedures are necessary at this time We do however encourage utilities to do as Entergy has done here and revise their OATTs t o include procedures for requesting interconnection services and the criteria for evaluating those requests Because an RTO will administer its pro form a tariff it is our hope that compliance with our RTO rulemaking will elimina te concerns about interconnection procedures at p Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow not paid to Entergy subject to refund FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No tarifffor example Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence Holds that all other terms of the Order No pro forma tariff apply to t he IA even if the IA does not repeat all those provisions Clarifies Tenn Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate receipt of power without expansion the new generator must pa y costs of expansion Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure interconnection and which are applicable when transmissiondelivery is also requested on OASIS Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline days for st iteration system impact and to provi de a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay Entergy had included no timelines If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide Approves Entergys credits for optional upgrades required to transport power away from the plant but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque nt studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement to show more intent to actually complete the project This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue just that the generator ma y be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects Thi s is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating Per EPMIs comments Entergy cannot keep the initial deposit un less actual costs are or greater generator must pay actual costs of studies Per EPMIs comments Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency or explain why that is inappropriate Per EPMIs comments Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato r pays for subsequent changes to Entergys transmission system ComEd Interconnection procedures On ComEd filed interconnection procedures Enrons comments were included in EPSAs protest on the following issues Proposed procedures Submit valid request to interconnect include of generating units proposed max MW capacity and MVA specific location operational date Da te and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position This info will be posted on OASIS within days without listing the applicants name Within days of the request LOI will be tendered Applicant has days to respond or lose queue position LOI authorizes commencement of engineering work Within days of LOI ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with a project diagram Study assumes interconnection of all competing requests that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs that have prior queue dates Within of receiving the interconnection study Applicant must decide whether to proceed After Applicant decides to proceed Applicant may have a maximum of days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an Interconnection Agreement Although somewhat unclear if there is a competing request Applicant must exercise its ROFR within days by notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection agreement If Applicant doesnt negotiate an IA lose queue spot Once IA negotiations begin Applicant has days to execute it or submit dispute to arbitration Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities IA must be executed if generator is to come on line in year ComEd will negotiate an agreement with appropriate financial safeguards to proceed before execution of the IA ComEd will include reasonable milestones that must be met in order to maintain queue position My specific comments for comment Some items are unclear Whether the Decision to proceed is made in writing which it should be The entire ROFR procedure does it become a race to see who executes an IA faster The day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERCs new statemen t in Tenn Power days If ComEd wont start work until after the IA is executed then the days needs to be adhered to otherwise the timetable seems too long before work begins Milestones need to be specified the current proposal contains may includ e milestones and may include the following Also ComEd wants to reasonably extend the milestones This must be done on a nondiscriminatory basis ComEd allows itself days to complete the Interconnection Study and this can be extended in ComEds sole judgment I disagree and think it should only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC simila r to the pro forma procedures now in section re system impact studies On FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic interconnection proceeding but encouraged utilities to revise OATTs to include interconnection procedures FERC also stated that the timelines in the OATT for transmission system impact studies days and facilities studies days are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd is required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines FE RC required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote st FERC ORDER ON AEPS INTERCONNECTION POLICY On FERC issued a n order on AEPs proposed interconnection procedures EPMI participated in comment s through EPSA While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe r and Entergy interconnection procedure there are several items of interest AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more than days to complete the System Impact Study FERC held that AEP must commit to completing the SIS within days consistent with the pro forma tariff but if AEP determines it needs more than days it is required t o notify the customer with the reasons for the delay FERC further stated We expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques ts to eliminate its backlog FERC rejected AEPs proposal to only provide transmission credits for firm transmission to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP nonfirm PTP or network Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors since AEP would ha ve to spend time educating the third party contractors however FERC reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog SPP Interconnection procedures In SPP filed clarifications to i ts interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC EPMI participated in EPSAs protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in days or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay instead of the day s requested by SPP SPP has agreed to this change which is also consistent with FERCs recent order on AEPs interconnection procedures Also it appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi n days which is close to physically impossible especially when SPP has n o pro forma IA SPP agreed to days CPL interconnection procedures Most recently CPL filed interconnecti on procedures that ask for a day study period despite the FERC orders in AE P and SPP stating that the deadlines are days EPSA

James D nron Richard ES Joe nron Subject Re Draft Questions for Hoecker TomFor your background information for Senator Gordonyou will need to edit out the information on the part Enron played but I thought you would want the entire picture Until the Tennessee Power case issued in March most utilities considered interconnection issues and procedures to be within their discretion The only FERC approved policies were in PJM and NEPOOL These policies are fairly idiosyncratic to those pools Since Enron began siting merchant generation with our peaking plants in TVA we had told FERC that there were problems in getting utilities to be responsive The main problem was failure to provide study results in a timely manner I think it is important to note that merchant facilities are a fairly new idea They are not ratebased and have no guaranteed return paid for directly by retail customers except perhaps to the extent that a utility signs a deal to purchase capacity andor energy from the merchant Plus I think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate d structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants les s supply TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY FERC issued an order o n clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues The order is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enrons membership in t he Electric Power Supply Association EPSA In midJanuary EPSA arranged allday meetings for Sarah Novosel Enron an d other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss interconnection issues Fourteen EPSA membercompanies were represented at these meetings and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate interconnection agreements with utilities We urged the Commission to at a minimum develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating interconnection agreements less time consuming and more evenhanded The Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for interconnection and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no t abide by the procedures for interconnection requests In the Tenn Power order that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee Power Co against Central Illinois which FERC dismissed FERC clarifies that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests apply equally to interconnection requests Furthermore FERC states that a utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission service along with its request for interconnection service stating that these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests and then the utility insists on performing costly and timeconsuming system impact studies for the transmission service even if the generator does not want the transmission service By applying the pro forma tariff procedure s to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept interconnection requests without transmission service requests FERC is eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities FERC also states that if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates terms or conditions of the interconnection the transmission customer may direct the utility to file within days an unexecuted agreement with FERC FERC will then have days to determine the just and reasonable rates ter ms and conditions for the interconnection service During the FERC agenda meeting on Commissioner Massey was very please d with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry with needed guidance Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac h develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all generators requesting interconnection service and he also encouraged the industry to work together to develop an industrywide pro forma interconnection agreement EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma interconnection agreement so Commissioner Masseys comments could encourag e the utility sector to begin negotiating an industrywide standardized agreement However even without a standardized agreement we hoped that FERCs order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by utilities to delay sometimes indefinitely the citing of new generation TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING TECO made a FERC filing to require minute by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission system EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing Befor e an order was issued somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC TECO withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations At this time FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create a standard generator imbalance schedule for the OATT FERC has said it wou ld review the filings on a case by case basis FERC has not required utilitie s to file imbalance schedules it encourages them to do so At this time only Entergy SOCO TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance provisions as amendments to their OATTs Most utilities require this to be negotiated not much room for negotiation in the interconnection agreements While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the y can be filed unsigned and then protested this can be an impractical solution when building a peaker in less than one year such as Enron has done A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo re friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero us in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING On Entergy filed a proposed interconnection policy and procedure at FERC EPMI protested various aspec ts and we assisted EPSA on its protest Before the order was issued again fairly unprecedented Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos ed interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to protests Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this filing Entergy agreed to change Defines required system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect EPMI and EPSA issue Required are those such as resulting from the Short CircuitBreaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysislik e circuit breakers relaying devices system protection equipment Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when in service did not go as far as EPMI argued that we should not be required to provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have to cut our deal Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives Adopted EPMIs proposed Emergency language that loss of Entergys generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for nonemergencies except when complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER C or SERC or reg agency EPMI issue Changed force majeure language to match OATT Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short CircuitBreaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an interconnection agreement is signed although the generation projects will remain in the queue This can cause the costs to vary from the st estimat e to time of actual interconnection On FERC issued an order accepting Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement IA and procedures subject to modification A s I mentioned above Entergy had adopted some of EPMIs suggestion in EPMIs comments including limiting emergencies to not include Entergys loss of generation All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS it is not included with an interconnection request Entergys interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale as well as unbundled retail Dismisses EPSAs call for a model and approves Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement subject to modificationThe Commission stated EPSA Dynegy and PGE argue that the Commission should initiate a generic proceeding or industry collaborative to address interconnection concernsThe Commission declines at this time to issue a policy statemen t or convene a industry collarboration to establish standardized IPs Interconnection Procedures and IAs Interconnection Agreements With respect to IPs the Commissions recent findings in Tenn Power amplify the Commissions findings in Order No which established standard procedur es for obtaining transmission service It is our belief that no additional standardized procedures are necessary at this time We do however encourage utilities to do as Entergy has done here and revise their OATTs t o include procedures for requesting interconnection services and the criteria for evaluating those requests Because an RTO will administer its pro form a tariff it is our hope that compliance with our RTO rulemaking will elimina te concerns about interconnection procedures at p Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow not paid to Entergy subject to refund FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No tarifffor example Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence Holds that all other terms of the Order No pro forma tariff apply to t he IA even if the IA does not repeat all those provisions Clarifies Tenn Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate receipt of power without expansion the new generator must pa y costs of expansion Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure interconnection and which are applicable when transmissiondelivery is also requested on OASIS Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline days for st iteration system impact and to provi de a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay Entergy had included no timelines If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide Approves Entergys credits for optional upgrades required to transport power away from the plant but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque nt studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement to show more intent to actually complete the project This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue just that the generator ma y be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects Thi s is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating Per EPMIs comments Entergy cannot keep the initial deposit un less actual costs are or greater generator must pay actual costs of studies Per EPMIs comments Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency or explain why that is inappropriate Per EPMIs comments Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato r pays for subsequent changes to Entergys transmission system ComEd Interconnection procedures On ComEd filed interconnection procedures Enrons comments were included in EPSAs protest on the following issues Proposed procedures Submit valid request to interconnect include of generating units proposed max MW capacity and MVA specific location operational date Da te and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position This info will be posted on OASIS within days without listing the applicants name Within days of the request LOI will be tendered Applicant has days to respond or lose queue position LOI authorizes commencement of engineering work Within days of LOI ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with a project diagram Study assumes interconnection of all competing requests that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs that have prior queue dates Within of receiving the interconnection study Applicant must decide whether to proceed After Applicant decides to proceed Applicant may have a maximum of days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an Interconnection Agreement Although somewhat unclear if there is a competing request Applicant must exercise its ROFR within days by notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection agreement If Applicant doesnt negotiate an IA lose queue spot Once IA negotiations begin Applicant has days to execute it or submit dispute to arbitration Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities IA must be executed if generator is to come on line in year ComEd will negotiate an agreement with appropriate financial safeguards to proceed before execution of the IA ComEd will include reasonable milestones that must be met in order to maintain queue position My specific comments for comment Some items are unclear Whether the Decision to proceed is made in writing which it should be The entire ROFR procedure does it become a race to see who executes an IA faster The day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERCs new statemen t in Tenn Power days If ComEd wont start work until after the IA is executed then the days needs to be adhered to otherwise the timetable seems too long before work begins Milestones need to be specified the current proposal contains may includ e milestones and may include the following Also ComEd wants to reasonably extend the milestones This must be done on a nondiscriminatory basis ComEd allows itself days to complete the Interconnection Study and this can be extended in ComEds sole judgment I disagree and think it should only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC simila r to the pro forma procedures now in section re system impact studies On FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic interconnection proceeding but encouraged utilities to revise OATTs to include interconnection procedures FERC also stated that the timelines in the OATT for transmission system impact studies days and facilities studies days are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd is required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines FE RC required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote st FERC ORDER ON AEPS INTERCONNECTION POLICY On FERC issued a n order on AEPs proposed interconnection procedures EPMI participated in comment s through EPSA While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe r and Entergy interconnection procedure there are several items of interest AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more than days to complete the System Impact Study FERC held that AEP must commit to completing the SIS within days consistent with the pro forma tariff but if AEP determines it needs more than days it is required t o notify the customer with the reasons for the delay FERC further stated We expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques ts to eliminate its backlog FERC rejected AEPs proposal to only provide transmission credits for firm transmission to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP nonfirm PTP or network Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors since AEP would ha ve to spend time educating the third party contractors however FERC reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog SPP Interconnection procedures In SPP filed clarifications to i ts interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC EPMI participated in EPSAs protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in days or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay instead of the day s requested by SPP SPP has agreed to this change which is also consistent with FERCs recent order on AEPs interconnection procedures Also it appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi n days which is close to physically impossible especially when SPP has n o pro forma IA SPP agreed to days CPL interconnection procedures Most recently CPL filed interconnecti on procedures that ask for a day study period despite the FERC orders in AE P and SPP stating that the deadlines are days EPSA protested with yet another appeal to FERC to standardize these procedures FERC has not issue d an order The lack of standardized procedures has become problematic in just the few months since Entergys procedures were filed We are required to constantl y monitor the notices for any procedures that have been filed then check eac h one carefully to determine how it deviates from the Commissions orders in other cases The utilities are not required to point this out in their filings ie no redlining from an OATT which is required in transmission OATT changes Tom NRON PM To Richard nron Mary CT Cynthia

James D nron Richard ES Joe nron Subject Re Draft Questions for Hoecker TomFor your background information for Senator Gordonyou will need to edit out the information on the part Enron played but I thought you would want the entire picture Until the Tennessee Power case issued in March most utilities considered interconnection issues and procedures to be within their discretion The only FERC approved policies were in PJM and NEPOOL These policies are fairly idiosyncratic to those pools Since Enron began siting merchant generation with our peaking plants in TVA we had told FERC that there were problems in getting utilities to be responsive The main problem was failure to provide study results in a timely manner I think it is important to note that merchant facilities are a fairly new idea They are not ratebased and have no guaranteed return paid for directly by retail customers except perhaps to the extent that a utility signs a deal to purchase capacity andor energy from the merchant Plus I think the utilities are incentivized under the current vertically integrate d structure to benefit their own merchant plants or their utility plants les s supply TENNESSEE POWER ORDER ON INTERCONNECTION POLICY FERC issued an order o n clearly expressing its policy on interconnection issues The order is significant because it was issued in large part due to the lobbying efforts of EPMI and other generator members through Enrons membership in t he Electric Power Supply Association EPSA In midJanuary EPSA arranged allday meetings for Sarah Novosel Enron an d other EPSA members to meet with the FERC Commissioners and staff to discuss interconnection issues Fourteen EPSA membercompanies were represented at these meetings and we expressed to the Commissioners and FERC staff the problems we are facing in our efforts to successfully negotiate interconnection agreements with utilities We urged the Commission to at a minimum develop procedures that will make requesting and negotiating interconnection agreements less time consuming and more evenhanded The Commission had assumed that the procedures laid out in the pro forma tariff for requesting transmission service also applied to requests for interconnection and they were surprised to learn that most utilities do no t abide by the procedures for interconnection requests In the Tenn Power order that dealt with a complaint filed by Tennessee Power Co against Central Illinois which FERC dismissed FERC clarifies that the pro forma tariff procedures established for transmission requests apply equally to interconnection requests Furthermore FERC states that a utility may not require a generator to submit a request for transmission service along with its request for interconnection service stating that these are separate services and should be treated separately by the utility Many generators have found that utilities are requiring them to submit transmission requests at the time they submit interconnection requests and then the utility insists on performing costly and timeconsuming system impact studies for the transmission service even if the generator does not want the transmission service By applying the pro forma tariff procedure s to interconnection requests and by requiring utilities to accept interconnection requests without transmission service requests FERC is eliminating many of the roadblocks currently encountered by generators in attempting to obtain interconnection from utilities FERC also states that if the parties to an interconnection agreement fail to agree on the rates terms or conditions of the interconnection the transmission customer may direct the utility to file within days an unexecuted agreement with FERC FERC will then have days to determine the just and reasonable rates ter ms and conditions for the interconnection service During the FERC agenda meeting on Commissioner Massey was very please d with the order and congratulated his colleagues on providing the industry with needed guidance Commissioner Massey then encouraged utilities to eac h develop their own standard interconnection agreement that applies to all generators requesting interconnection service and he also encouraged the industry to work together to develop an industrywide pro forma interconnection agreement EPMI has been working with EPSA on a pro forma interconnection agreement so Commissioner Masseys comments could encourag e the utility sector to begin negotiating an industrywide standardized agreement However even without a standardized agreement we hoped that FERCs order will help remove many of the obstacles currently used by utilities to delay sometimes indefinitely the citing of new generation TECO HOURLY IMBALANCE FILING TECO made a FERC filing to require minute by minute balancing for generators that interconnect to the transmission system EPMI protested through EPSA and asked for hourly balancing Befor e an order was issued somewhat unprecedented behavior before FERC TECO withdrew its minute filing and refiled for hourly imbalance calculations At this time FERC has not accepted requests by EPSA and others to create a standard generator imbalance schedule for the OATT FERC has said it wou ld review the filings on a case by case basis FERC has not required utilitie s to file imbalance schedules it encourages them to do so At this time only Entergy SOCO TECO and several other utilities have filed imbalance provisions as amendments to their OATTs Most utilities require this to be negotiated not much room for negotiation in the interconnection agreements While FERC requires interconnection agreements to be filed at FERC and the y can be filed unsigned and then protested this can be an impractical solution when building a peaker in less than one year such as Enron has done A merchant power producer is more likely to move the project to a mo re friendly utility forum or accept some provisions that may be somewhat onero us in order to site and build the plant for summer start dates ENTERGY INTERCONNECTION FILING On Entergy filed a proposed interconnection policy and procedure at FERC EPMI protested various aspec ts and we assisted EPSA on its protest Before the order was issued again fairly unprecedented Entergy agreed to make certain changes to its propos ed interconnection procedure and interconnection agreement in response to protests Entergy asked FERC to delay an order until it could make this filing Entergy agreed to change Defines required system upgrades as those required to simply interconnect EPMI and EPSA issue Required are those such as resulting from the Short CircuitBreaker Rating Analysis and Transient Stability Analysislik e circuit breakers relaying devices system protection equipment Customers are not required to supply reactive power except when in service did not go as far as EPMI argued that we should not be required to provide it or should receive the cost of our liquidated damages if we have to cut our deal Entergy said it will pass through amounts it receives Adopted EPMIs proposed Emergency language that loss of Entergys generation and inability to meet its load requirements is not an Emergency Agreed that Entergy cannot interrupt generator for nonemergencies except when complying with reliability protocols or procedures established by NER C or SERC or reg agency EPMI issue Changed force majeure language to match OATT Entergy also states that it will not include generators in Short CircuitBreaker Analysis and Transient Stability Analysis until an interconnection agreement is signed although the generation projects will remain in the queue This can cause the costs to vary from the st estimat e to time of actual interconnection On FERC issued an order accepting Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement IA and procedures subject to modification A s I mentioned above Entergy had adopted some of EPMIs suggestion in EPMIs comments including limiting emergencies to not include Entergys loss of generation All transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS it is not included with an interconnection request Entergys interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve wholesale as well as unbundled retail Dismisses EPSAs call for a model and approves Entergys pro forma interconnection agreement subject to modificationThe Commission stated EPSA Dynegy and PGE argue that the Commission should initiate a generic proceeding or industry collaborative to address interconnection concernsThe Commission declines at this time to issue a policy statemen t or convene a industry collarboration to establish standardized IPs Interconnection Procedures and IAs Interconnection Agreements With respect to IPs the Commissions recent findings in Tenn Power amplify the Commissions findings in Order No which established standard procedur es for obtaining transmission service It is our belief that no additional standardized procedures are necessary at this time We do however encourage utilities to do as Entergy has done here and revise their OATTs t o include procedures for requesting interconnection services and the criteria for evaluating those requests Because an RTO will administer its pro form a tariff it is our hope that compliance with our RTO rulemaking will elimina te concerns about interconnection procedures at p Agreed with EPMI that billing disputes should be placed in escrow not paid to Entergy subject to refund FERC said that the IA should conform to other aspects of the Order No tarifffor example Entergy and customer are responsible for their own negligence Holds that all other terms of the Order No pro forma tariff apply to t he IA even if the IA does not repeat all those provisions Clarifies Tenn Power case that if a generator connects first and another generator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot accommodate receipt of power without expansion the new generator must pa y costs of expansion Entergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions are pure interconnection and which are applicable when transmissiondelivery is also requested on OASIS Entergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a specific timeline days for st iteration system impact and to provi de a statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an explanation for the delay Entergy had included no timelines If applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms Entergy must file the unexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide Approves Entergys credits for optional upgrades required to transport power away from the plant but requires Entergy to file an explanation of how the credits work Entergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subseque nt studies once they have signed an interconnection agreement to show more intent to actually complete the project This does not mean that failure to execute an IA results in removal from the queue just that the generator ma y be subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects Thi s is a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection Entergy will also post its queue on OASIS Reactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating Per EPMIs comments Entergy cannot keep the initial deposit un less actual costs are or greater generator must pay actual costs of studies Per EPMIs comments Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency or explain why that is inappropriate Per EPMIs comments Entergy must explain the requirement that the generato r pays for subsequent changes to Entergys transmission system ComEd Interconnection procedures On ComEd filed interconnection procedures Enrons comments were included in EPSAs protest on the following issues Proposed procedures Submit valid request to interconnect include of generating units proposed max MW capacity and MVA specific location operational date Da te and time of receipt by ComEd establishes queue position This info will be posted on OASIS within days without listing the applicants name Within days of the request LOI will be tendered Applicant has days to respond or lose queue position LOI authorizes commencement of engineering work Within days of LOI ComEd will perform an Interconnection Study with a project diagram Study assumes interconnection of all competing requests that ask for a location that affects your interconnection costs that have prior queue dates Within of receiving the interconnection study Applicant must decide whether to proceed After Applicant decides to proceed Applicant may have a maximum of days for a ROFR against lower priority requests and to begin negotiating an Interconnection Agreement Although somewhat unclear if there is a competing request Applicant must exercise its ROFR within days by notifying ComEd of the desire to begin negotiating an interconnection agreement If Applicant doesnt negotiate an IA lose queue spot Once IA negotiations begin Applicant has days to execute it or submit dispute to arbitration Before ComEd does inititates construction or installation of facilities IA must be executed if generator is to come on line in year ComEd will negotiate an agreement with appropriate financial safeguards to proceed before execution of the IA ComEd will include reasonable milestones that must be met in order to maintain queue position My specific comments for comment Some items are unclear Whether the Decision to proceed is made in writing which it should be The entire ROFR procedure does it become a race to see who executes an IA faster The day IA execution period is now inconsistent with FERCs new statemen t in Tenn Power days If ComEd wont start work until after the IA is executed then the days needs to be adhered to otherwise the timetable seems too long before work begins Milestones need to be specified the current proposal contains may includ e milestones and may include the following Also ComEd wants to reasonably extend the milestones This must be done on a nondiscriminatory basis ComEd allows itself days to complete the Interconnection Study and this can be extended in ComEds sole judgment I disagree and think it should only be extended if ComEd provides a reasonable explanation to FERC simila r to the pro forma procedures now in section re system impact studies On FERC issued an order that again declined to initiate a generic interconnection proceeding but encouraged utilities to revise OATTs to include interconnection procedures FERC also stated that the timelines in the OATT for transmission system impact studies days and facilities studies days are applicable to interconnection studies and that ComEd is required to provide an explanation for any delays past these deadlines FE RC required ComEd to change some other procedures identified by the EPSA prote st FERC ORDER ON AEPS INTERCONNECTION POLICY On FERC issued a n order on AEPs proposed interconnection procedures EPMI participated in comment s through EPSA While FERC largely reiterated its recent orders on Tenn Powe r and Entergy interconnection procedure there are several items of interest AEP said that it had a backlog of interconnection requests and needed more than days to complete the System Impact Study FERC held that AEP must commit to completing the SIS within days consistent with the pro forma tariff but if AEP determines it needs more than days it is required t o notify the customer with the reasons for the delay FERC further stated We expect AEP to dedicate sufficient resources to these interconnection reques ts to eliminate its backlog FERC rejected AEPs proposal to only provide transmission credits for firm transmission to a customer that is required to pay for system upgrades FERC said credits must apply to firm PTP nonfirm PTP or network Allows AEP discretion on hiring third party contractors since AEP would ha ve to spend time educating the third party contractors however FERC reiterates that AEP must eliminate its backlog SPP Interconnection procedures In SPP filed clarifications to i ts interconnection procedures recently filed at FERC EPMI participated in EPSAs protest that the System Impact Study should be completed in days or SPP should provide an explanation for the delay instead of the day s requested by SPP SPP has agreed to this change which is also consistent with FERCs recent order on AEPs interconnection procedures Also it appeared that SPP wanted the Interconnection Agreement to be executed withi n days which is close to physically impossible especially when SPP has n o pro forma IA SPP agreed to days CPL interconnection procedures Most recently CPL filed interconnecti on procedures that ask for a day study period despite the FERC orders in AE P and SPP stating that the deadlines are days EPSA protested with yet another appeal to FERC to standardize these procedures FERC has not issue d an order The lack of standardized procedures has become problematic in just the few months since Entergys procedures were filed We are required to constantl y monitor the notices for any procedures that have been filed then check eac h one carefully to determine how it deviates from the Commissions orders in other cases The utilities are not required to point this out in their filings ie no redlining from an OATT which is required in transmission OATT changes Tom NRON PM To Richard nron Mary CT Cynthia

not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures I cannot determine whether protest is necessary for example PJM NY and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool but that work ok for the pool The TOs have also filed Amend interconnection procedures but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these Maybe one of the paralegals could check that In addition one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct Filing letter The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERCs orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its longterm planning and expansion process but other priorities have prevented it from doing so Discusses the two previously methodologies

method of sharing upgrade costs but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision This is one we have used in other Inter Agreements If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree

consistency with FERC orders on interconnection procedures Potential issues are identified below and you all can decide if Enron should protestintervene the West Developers may want to review this too Since I am not familiar with the Cal ISO procedures I cannot determine whether protest is necessary for example PJM NY and NEPOOL have certain interconnection policies that would not be acceptable outside the pool but that work ok for the pool The TOs have also filed Amend interconnection procedures but I have not looked at those to see if they mirror these Maybe one of the paralegals could check that In addition one of you should review the filing letter and procedures to make sure that the statements made by Cal ISO are correct Filing letter The Cal ISO states that these procedures are filed in response to FERCs orders and that the Cal ISO and Market Participants are examining policies that will ensure that the ISO Controlled Grid is expanded to support competitive markets It also states that it would have liked to propose complementary changes to its longterm planning and expansion process but other priorities have prevented it from doing so Discusses the two previously methodologies regarding interconnection procedures No Grandfathering of Transmission Rights and Advance Congestion Cost Mitigation which was apparently rejected last year Filing Letter at Cal ISO does not propose a method of sharing upgrade costs but states that the procedures do not preclude such a provision This is one we have used in other Inter Agreements If required by law or if the Parties mutually agree to allow one or more third parties to use the Interconnection Facilities or any part thereof whether by transfer of the Interconnection Facilities to an RTO or otherwise and such use decreases the capacity of the Interconnection Facilities available to TO or the Facility or otherwise causes any detriment to TO or the Facility or benefits any party including TO other than Generator or if TO is compensated for the costs of the Interconnection Facilities in whole or in part for any reason Generator will be entitled to compensation from TO based upon the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third party users and Generator for the greater of i whatever costs Generator incurred in connection with the Interconnection Facilities plus interest at the Interest Rate from the date of Generators payment of the costs in connection with the Interconnection Facilities and ii the value that TO receives for the Interconnection Facilities Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence the Parties may use any other mutually agreed upon methodology to determine such compensation If one or more third parties are to use the Interconnection Facilities in accordance with Section Generators obligation to reimburse TO for the operation and maintenance costs incurred by TO in connection with the Interconnection Facilities shall be based on the pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities by TO all third parties users and Generator or on some other mutually agreed upon methodology provided however that under no circumstances shall Generators share of TOs operation and maintenance costs be greater than its pro rata use of the Interconnection Facilities Procedures The timelines for submitting applications and responding to system impact studies SIS and facilities study FS are fine per previous FERC orders in fact Cal ISO asks for days to complete the Facilities Study PGE just filed requesting days c I would add on a nondiscriminatory basis after unless otherwise agreed by the ISO and the Interconnecting PTO allows the generator to perform its own SIS and FS subject to review by the Cal ISO and TO this is a good provision that has not
