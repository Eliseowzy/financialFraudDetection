valid and had a few thoughts that might help to clarify The State Department and UK Foreign Commercial Office developed these principles with the intent that the principles would serve as broad guidelines general enough to apply to any company in any industry As you will note with the exception of the title the principles are general and applicable to any company involved with hiring security to protect an facility andor asset be it in the US or otherwise I agree that we may need to distinguish ourselves from the typical extractive sector participant Should we agree to support the principles I suggest that we draft the letter so that it distinguishes Enron from the other participating companies The letter and maybe Dept of State could also note that Enron is the first company outside of the extractive sector to support these principles This would go a long way in demonstrating our leadership on the issue of human rights Also we may want to consider that while we may be exiting the asset development business by selling our pipelines and power plants we are taking equity positions albeit minority andor short term in industries that do fall into the category of extractive industries such as coal and metals To date we have already received inquiries about our activities in these sectors particularly in the coal sector With respect to public accountability we will continue to be criticized for not being accountable in this area unless we take some policies steps in this area Our stakeholders and critics are aware that we do not have policies and procedures addressing security arrangements In addition they are aware that we have participated in this discussion and dialogue because it is our intent to strengthen our human rights policies and performance Until now the weakness in our critics arguments with respect to India and otherwise has been the lack of benchmarks andor guidelines with respect to this issue However once these guidelines are public it will be difficult to maintain the position that there is a lack of consensus on the issue A risk we should consider should we decide not to support the principles the NGOs and others will be asking us why we have not adopted theseand or any guidelines These guidelines are particularly attractive because they have been developed in collaboration with government industry and NGOs rather than by one particular interest I hope this is helpful and look forward to your feedback I am in the Washington office today but can be reached on my cell at Thanks again Lauren From John NRONDEVELOPMENT on PM To Lauren CT Kelly nron Communications Mark NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Steven J ES Vicki ES Subject Security and Human Rights Policy Question We are finishing the legal comments to the Security and Human Rights paper that Lauren Goldblatt circulated for legal review and will finalize it today ot tomorrow Before get the detailed comments out however there is a threshold policy issue that needs to be considered These guidelines expressly applicaty to the Extractive Industries which are typically thought of as the mining and oil and gas exploration and development industries The companies listed as cooperating with the UK and US governments and the NGOs in producing the principles do not include Enron peers Enron has only one unit that is engaged in that economic sector and that unit is being sold right now None of Enrons other units are in what would normally be referred to as an extractive industry Since that is the case we wonder if Enron has made an appropriate level policy decision to publicly endorse these principles and make them corporate policy when the company is energetically exiting its only remaining business line that is in the express industrial peer group targeted by the principles At first I understood that such a decision had been taken but Vicki and I wanted to confirm that before proceeding There are two major concerns Endorsing the principles would would identify Enron more closely with the members of a particular peer group that Enron is consciously exiting and distingushing itself from Once Enron endorses the principles the fact of that endorsement the resulting public accountability for the principles and the consequent need to demonstrate compliance will become essentially a permanent feature Once endorsed it would be nearly impossible for the Company to distance itself from the guidlines That being the case should Enron at this juncture endorse the guidelines when it could do so later if it ever makes a committed reentry into the extractive industry Are there other security type principles that are more appropriate to or focused on our new core business lines or the remaining asset ownership and construction lines that Enron should be looking at instead Please call either me at to discuss You can also call Vicki Sharp at Thanks
