<12679778.1075858447319.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,walsh@enron.com,2001-06-05 14:22:24,California Update Cc Summary Edisons MOU Condemned at this Fridays CPUC Meeting The Idle Plan Z Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief Edisons MOU Doubtful The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edi sons potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic investment bank analysts and other company shareholders We have reported that through all plans from BZ there is not a solid plan to save this co mpany and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may co me to fruition Over the last few days Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the C PUC meeting this Friday as a makeorbreak event for the company The is b ecause after the meeting Daviss MOU plan to buy SoCals grid will have no chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy This plan is essentially dea d although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases The fin al nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voti ng on several necessary MOU provisions Unless the CPUC makes a last minut e emergency amendment to their agenda the deal will be dead despite S oCals support for letting the deal stand past its deadline Sources indi cate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and co ntinues to distance herself from Davis Attempting to influence policy making Edison executives have spent the las t few investor phone conferences warning that June would see substantiall y increased risks for a creditorinduced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies at CPUC This is interesting since no one else seems to have been focused on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week However the re is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in two weeks As reported several times earlier most everyone had given up on the MOU long before this Fridays CPUC meeting Plan Z Shows Little Progress Meanwhile the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday has gained little progress Legislators continue to pinpoint a plan that will secure reelection votes and at the same time weigh the need for rat e hikes for Californias corporate and home electricity users As they has h it out the state is spending even more on electricity purchases In spi te of better than expected levels of conservation the states electricity expenditures over the last month rose to an average of Mday The recent rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into questio n the reassuring Angelides scenario for Californias budget prospects later this year The California Budget Crunch Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last mon ths conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Conn ell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong Angelides a rgued that B already spent to buy power since January was really the to tal amount of authorized spending through late August In fact he said on ly B of that had been spent Sources now indicate that Angelides wa s technically correct if you use spent to mean only the amount of money f or which checks had been written This is different than the amount of mon ey California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supp lied energy to the state In fact when Angelides was speaking the state h ad in fact already promised to pay B for energy it had already consumed the total committed has topped B By the time the state gets its power bonds auctioned in August they will have already spent all B and be b ack to dipping into the General Fund The idea of RANs being auctioned be fore the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund does nt make it to August The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the painful process that the legislature is undertaking now another round of huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance Then the hope is that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wh olesale rates down and the debts can be repaid The only near term path t o bringing generating assets on line immediately is the MW from QF pl ants which are off line because of cash flow problems Settling their need s is wrapped up in settling the PGE and Edison trade creditor issues whic h makes the legislatures leisurely approach to the rate hikehaircut situa tion all the more troublesome Energy Relief The House Energy Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on HR th e Emergency Electricity Relief Act tomorrow at am The bill which w as twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps but d uring the course of the markup sources indicate that it is possible even likely that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment Rep Waxman D CA offered a price cap amendment at an earlier markup of the bill at the subcommittee level The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines all Republicans and Democrats voted nay Sources inside Joe Bartons of fice report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromi se on the price cap issue but nothing has been resolved As of this aftern oon those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse i n the Committee tomorrow Since an agreement was not reached compromise l anguage is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow If it is it would not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass Sources indica te that the committee does expect Waxman and possibly others to offer pric e cap language but it is not expected to pass

<489176.1075857680320.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,walsh@enron.com,2001-06-08 13:37:18,California Update Cc Delays QF Payment Vote Sources believe that the delay in the PUC vote on paying the QFs of their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a preference payment to the QFs the PUC does follow these issues out of necessity given the current environment and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the payment The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCals and PGEs cash flows currently Additionally agreeing to pay of debts to the QFs raises legal issues in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors but not others This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the nonQF creditors
