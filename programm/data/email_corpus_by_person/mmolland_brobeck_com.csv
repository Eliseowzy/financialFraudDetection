and Dynegy and me for over two hours at the State Capital yesterday I will report fully on the meeting by telephone tomorrow morning however this report summarizes the principal issues covered in the session Dunn spent about a half hour describing the scope of his subcommittees investigation He styled it as an investigation into whether anticompetitive behavior has occurred or is occurring in the California wholesale market If they find that it has they will recommend curative legislation If they find the behavior was criminal they will refer evidence to the AG Dun vowed that he would not allow parties adverse to the generators to participate in this investigation At the same time he is inviting other county and state lawyers to help him the first volunteer is the San Joaquin District Attorney He said there was no predetermined conclusion and he would allow the generators to explain the suspicious facts He said the investigation would be fair and that if there was a leak of information we should let him know He had two initial requests first he wants immediate production of Enrons document retention he actually called it document destruction policy We are to let him know by Wednesday if we will produce the current version Second he wants the parties to stipulate to an order pledging that each will not destroy documents He says he will go to court to get such an order if we refuse The rest of the meeting was spent negotiating a confidentiality order The generators had earlier sent subcommittee special counsel Larry Drivan a discussion draft of such an order Dunn and Drivan discussed it point by point At the onset Drivan acknowledged Enron had not seen the draft and said nothing said at the meeting would bind Enron to any position about it The generators and Dunn seemed to agree on many of the principal points eg they would in fact consent to such an order the subcommittee could contest claims of confidentiality the subcommittee could require the logging of privileged documents and the assertion of privilege could be challenged in court they would all initiate a procedure for a court to sign such an order and preside over discovery disputes Surprisingly most generators did not object when Dunn suggested Sacramento Superior Court as the proper venuealthough there was no final agreement on this The dispute between the committee and the generators was primarily over who could view confidential documents The generators wanted NDAs signed by all staff as well as all consultants and experts Dunn refused Last week the subcommittee subpoenaed the ISO for documents that pertain to ISO conclusions of market manipulation The ISO has refused to allow the generators or Enron see the documents they will produce The generators have discussed seeking a protective order venue uncertain but Dunn and most of the generators seemed to believe the stipulated confidentiality order under discussion would solve the problem of ISO production Duke asked Dunn to delay the production date for ISO for a few days until they can work out the terms of the confidentiality order Duke per Kleinman is in charge of drafting the order Kleinman said he would get a draft to Dunn early next week Dunn said he had no objection if the generators got documents from ISO He asked that the generators call ISO directly and see if ISO would give the documents to them Several generators said they would do that The meeting was maintained at a very professional level Dunns approach was one of a class action lawyer in a roomful of big corporate defendants urging everyone to get along because as professionals everyone knew how the game gets played However he is seriously understaffed He has few resources for litigation nor has he resources to review the millions of documents he has requested He must be relying on either outside experts or outside allies to do that Given that it is hard to see how a confidentiality order could be enforced against him regardless of what he staff discloses Further if he uses outside experts to do who are not bound by the order they will likely go to work against us later with the information The generators already have made considerable productions to the AG and they may be less troubled by this They certainly seemed willing to play ball at the meeting although privately they may have other plans which they did not air with Dunn We should talk to them about that This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information

<18880449.1075853225772.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-06-08 04:30:00,Procedural defects in subpoena served by California AG on EES Cc You asked us to determine whether there are defects on the face of the subpoena served upon EES which may prevent its enforcement in superior court Assuming the court holds the subpoena to the standard of a deposition subpoena and we think it should it is defective in at least two respects First it was not served upon Enron by personal service as required by CCP of Second Government Code o provides that the Attorney General must first file a petition in superior court to require the custodian of records to appear and testify While the subpoena requests a deposition of the Enron EES custodian of records the AG did not file such a petition In addition Government Code o provides that a person served with such a subpoena is not obliged to attend as a witness if he or she does not reside or do business within miles of the court in which he or she is asked to appear At your request we are now researching and will draft over the weekend a memorandum to address three issues arising from this subpoena whether EES has substantive grounds to refuse to comply with the subpoena or to disqualify the AG from enforcing it whether EES may successfully remove any compliance proceeding brought by the AG to federal court and the consequences to EES if it should be held in contempt for refusal to comply A discussion of the defects in the EES subpoena follows There are three defects in the subpoena served on Enron Enery Services EES on May pursuant to California Government Code section The subpoena purports to require EES to produce its custodian of record on June to testify and to answer questions and to produce documents responsive to the document requests Subpoena at Accordingly its demands are in the nature of a subpoena for deposition and we analyze it on this basis Defective Service The subpoena appears defective because it was served by mail instead of personal service Service of a deposition subpoena pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section f requires that the subpoena be served personally not by mail For the reasons discussed below we believe that the subpoena served on EES is deposition subpoena subject to the personal service requirements of CCP o f First the subpoena is a deposition subpoena because it seeks to compel oral testimony from EESs custodian of records The method of taking oral testimony in California outside of court is by way of deposition CCP o et seq Here the subpoena commands EES custodian of records to testify and to answer questions Subpoena at It also states that the custodian of records will be questioned under oath regarding methods of compliance and whether all documents described in this subpoena have been produced Subpoena at Moreover the subpoena is issued pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government Code sections Government Code section is entitled Depositions petition order enforcement emphasis supplied The subpoena should thus properly be considered a deposition subpoena Second the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure governing deposition subpoenas applies to the subpoena served on EES Government Code section provides that in the case of deposition subpoenas the deposition is governed by the California Code of Civil Procedure The Attorney General has also issued a formal opinion stating that the Code of Civil Procedure governs subpoenas issued pursuant to Gov Code o Presumably Gov Code o authorizing the head of the Department to issue a subpoena for the production of books papers or documents would be governed by the general law relating to subpoenas duces tecum see Sec CCP Attorney Generals Opinions Opinion No see also Attorney Generals Opinions Opinion No service of subpoena pursuant to Gov Code o must comply with Code of Civil Procedure o Because the subpoena is a deposition subpoena subject to the Code of Civil Procedure the requirement that it be served personally not by mail should apply The Subpoena is Defective Because the Attorney General Failed to First File a Petition in Superior Court and Obtain a Court Order Requiring the Custodian of Records to Appear and Testify Government Code section provides In any matter pending before a department head the department head may cause the deposition of persons residing within or without the state to be taken by causing a petition to be filed in the Superior Court in the County of Sacramento reciting the nature of the matter pending the name and residence of the person whose testimony is desired and asking that an order be made requiring the person to appear and testify before an officer named in the petition for that purpose The Attorney General while purporting to serve the subpoena pursuant to this section Pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government Code section failed to comply with Government Code section by first filing a petition and obtaining a court order permitting the taking of testimony For this reason the subpoena should be considered defective The Supoena is Defective for Purporting to Compel Attendance by the Custodian of Records at a Location More than Fifty Miles from His Residence Government Code section provides a person is not obliged to attend as a witness in any matter under this article at a place out of the county in which he resides unless the distance is less than miles from his place of business emphasis supplied The subpoena is addressed to EESs custodian of records and is issued primarily for the purpose of having EES through your most knowledgeable person testify and produce documents Subpoena at Presumably EESs custodian of records who is most knowledgeable with respect to the documents requested in the subpoena resides more than miles from San Francisco If so the subpoena would be defective and EESs custodian of records would not be obliged to attend as a witness This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information Any

<17513348.1075853225879.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-06-08 07:35:00,Memorandum concerning subpoena power of California legislative co mmitteeour meeting in San Francisco yesterday a group of you asked we republish our memorandum regarding the subpoena power of California legislative committee Here is a slightly edited version What is the basis of a Legislative Committees Subpoena Power Authority Government Code Section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate Assembly or a committee may be issued by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house Govt Code Section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the Senate Assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the President of the Senate Speaker of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired Contempt Power If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt Govt Code Section If the contempt is committed while the Legislature is in session Govt Code Section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or Assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or Assembly If the Legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled Govt Code Section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested It is unclear how this provision would or could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company Motion to Quash Subpoena California courts have held under CCP Section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum See eg People ex rel Dept of Public Works v Younger CalAppd My research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting Govt Code et seq Therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear but arguable that subpoenas issued by legislative committees will be held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against Enron for outofstate Enron documents There is little case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is likely that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Accordingly we use these provisions to analyze this question a Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service However there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duces tecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to an Enron entity within California that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents While it is an open question Enron can certainly argue that the custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open b Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq An additional threshold question regarding the territorial effect of this subpoena concerns whether it is should be considered a deposition subpoena The question is If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody This email message is for the sole use of

jurisdiction In one early case the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate Committee were fatally defective Ex Parte McLain CalAppd In McLain the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr McLain the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents Mr McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents Upon representation of the Committee the Superior Court issued an order directing Mr McLain to produce the documents Mr McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating That based upon evidence in its possession the said Senate Interim Committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No and That each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate Resolution No The Superior Court found Mr McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records The Court of Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for In cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense McLain at This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting CCP which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements See eg Grannis v Board of Medical Examiners CalAppd However cases interpreting CCP also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper See eg Pacific Auto Ins Co v Superior Court CalAppd It is unclear but arguable that subpoenas issued by legislative committees will be held to this same standard What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against Enron for outofstate Enron documents There is little case law interpreting Govt Code et seq and the Govt Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on issuance of subpoenas CCP et seq Therefore it is likely that the provisions of both the Govt Code and the CCP will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee Accordingly we use these provisions to analyze this question a Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq CCP is entitled Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that A witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of Section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service However there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by Section Section provides when a subpoena duces tecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in Article commencing with Section of Chapter of Division of the Evidence Code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena Section shall not apply Evade Code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen On commentator noted the following with respect to CCP The rule limiting subpoenas to California residents CCP does not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required See CCP Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London CalAppth fn Thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in California by producing the records in accordance with Cal Evid Code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk However CCP probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California jurisdiction Otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident See Amoco Chem Co v Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of London supra Werner Fairbanks Epstein Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Trials at Moreover in one unpublished case Allee v King CalAppd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial In so holding the court stated that even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents Although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals See eg Heinz v Heinz CalAppd Pd and cases cited therein The recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders See CJS Witnesses S p S p S p AmJurd Witnesses S p S p However the Allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate Therefore even under Allee if a subpoena was issued to an Enron entity within California that possessed responsive documents that Enron entity may be obligated to respond See Boal v Price Waterhouse Co CalAppd Therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of Enron Enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under CCP It also seems probable that under Amoco and Allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a nonCalifornia Enron entity the subpoena may be invalid However if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents While it is an open question Enron can certainly argue that the custodian of records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California entity This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the CCP statutory scheme see below but is still open b Subpoenas against outofstate residents under CCP et seq An additional threshold question regarding the territorial effect of this subpoena concerns whether it is should be considered a deposition subpoena The question is If the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat Enron as a party or as a nonparty The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously different for the two The deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue After all if a court was resolving the issue at all an Enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party However it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat Enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena There are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum The second of these is the most relevant to Enron The attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken CCP b Specifically CCP b provides If the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity Some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending This question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents Weil Brown Rutter Group California Practice Guide Civil Procedure Before Trial at notes It is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state CCP d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records Whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear If it does serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere The result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody This email message is for the sole use of

whether there are defects on the face of the subpoena served upon EES which may prevent its enforcement in superior court Assuming the court holds the subpoena to the standard of a deposition subpoena and we think it should it is defective in at least two respects First it was not served upon Enron by personal service as required by CCP f Second Government Code provides that the Attorney General must first file a petition in superior court to require the custodian of records to appear and testify While the subpoena requests a deposition of the Enron EES custodian of records the AG did not file such a petition In addition Government Code provides that a person served with such a subpoena is not obliged to attend as a witness if he or she does not reside or do business within miles of the court in which he or she is asked to appear At your request we are now researching and will draft over the weekend a memorandum to address three issues arising from this subpoena whether EES has substantive grounds to refuse to comply with the subpoena or to disqualify the AG from enforcing it whether EES may successfully remove any compliance proceeding brought by the AG to federal court and the consequences to EES if it should be held in contempt for refusal to comply A discussion of the defects in the EES subpoena follows There are three defects in the subpoena served on Enron Enery Services EES on May pursuant to California Government Code section The subpoena purports to require EES to produce its custodian of record on June to testify and to answer questions and to produce documents responsive to the document requests Subpoena at Accordingly its demands are in the nature of a subpoena for deposition and we analyze it on this basis Defective Service The subpoena appears defective because it was served by mail instead of personal service Service of a deposition subpoena pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section f requires that the subpoena be served personally not by mail For the reasons discussed below we believe that the subpoena served on EES is deposition subpoena subject to the personal service requirements of CCP f First the subpoena is a deposition subpoena because it seeks to compel oral testimony from EESs custodian of records The method of taking oral testimony in California outside of court is by way of deposition CCP et seq Here the subpoena commands EES custodian of records to testify and to answer questions Subpoena at It also states that the custodian of records will be questioned under oath regarding methods of compliance and whether all documents described in this subpoena have been produced Subpoena at Moreover the subpoena is issued pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government Code sections Government Code section is entitled Depositions petition order enforcement emphasis supplied The subpoena should thus properly be considered a deposition subpoena Second the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure governing deposition subpoenas applies to the subpoena served on EES Government Code section provides that in the case of deposition subpoenas the deposition is governed by the California Code of Civil Procedure The Attorney General has also issued a formal opinion stating that the Code of Civil Procedure governs subpoenas issued pursuant to Gov Code Presumably Gov Code authorizing the head of the Department to issue a subpoena for the production of books papers or documents would be governed by the general law relating to subpoenas duces tecum see Sec CCP Attorney Generals Opinions Opinion No see also Attorney Generals Opinions Opinion No service of subpoena pursuant to Gov Code must comply with Code of Civil Procedure Because the subpoena is a deposition subpoena subject to the Code of Civil Procedure the requirement that it be served personally not by mail should apply The Subpoena is Defective Because the Attorney General Failed to First File a Petition in Superior Court and Obtain a Court Order Requiring the Custodian of Records to Appear and Testify Government Code section provides In any matter pending before a department head the department head may cause the deposition of persons residing within or without the state to be taken by causing a petition to be filed in the Superior Court in the County of Sacramento reciting the nature of the matter pending the name and residence of the person whose testimony is desired and asking that an order be made requiring the person to appear and testify before an officer named in the petition for that purpose The Attorney General while purporting to serve the subpoena pursuant to this section Pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government Code section failed to comply with Government Code section by first filing a petition and obtaining a court order permitting the taking of testimony For this reason the subpoena should be considered defective The Supoena is Defective for Purporting to Compel Attendance by the Custodian of Records at a Location More than Fifty Miles from His Residence Government Code section provides a person is not obliged to attend as a witness in any matter under this article at a place out of the county in which he resides unless the distance is less than miles from his place of business emphasis supplied The subpoena is addressed to EESs custodian of records and is issued primarily for the purpose of having EES through your most knowledgeable person testify and produce documents Subpoena at Presumably EESs custodian of records who is most knowledgeable with respect to the documents requested in the subpoena resides more than miles from San Francisco If so the subpoena would be defective and EESs custodian of records would not be obliged to attend as a witness This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information Any unauthorized review use disclosure

<17856734.1075858668420.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-06-18 16:41:37,Enforcement of subpoenas by California Attorney GeneralB NonPrivilegedpst This memorandum further analyzes the ability of Enron and EES to remove to federal court a California state court proceeding to enforce a subpoena for documents and testimony It specifically addresses the arguments raised by the briefs filed by the Reliant Mirant and the California Attorney General in April and May in litigation relating to a similar enforcement proceeding in Reliant Energy Power Generation Inc et al v Lockyer California Superior Court Los Angeles County Case No BC In light of the Reliant case if EES removes an enforcement proceeding to federal court the AG will probably argue that the petition for removal is not a civil action because a petition to enforce the subpoena is a special proceeding and not an action We also anticipate that the AG will argue that there is no federal question because the Government Code sections provide an exclusive statutory scheme which provides jurisdiction only to the California superior court These arguments do not change our previous analysis but highlight the our conclusion assuming the existence of a federal question in the AGs enforcement petition EES can file a petition for removal but its burden to prevail on a motion for remand will be difficult to meet I SUMMARY OF RELIANT ET AL V LOCKYER In early Lockyer served subpoenas for documents on Reliant and Mirant under Government Code sections et seq Reliant and Mirant did not dispute the AGs ability to seek this information and voluntarily produced nonconfidential information However Reliant and Mirant disputed the AGs ability to disclose confidential information without a protective order Several days before the AG as a petitioner filed an enforcement action in San Francisco Superior Court to compel Reliant and Mirant to produce documents Reliant and Mirant affirmatively filed a complaint as plaintiffs for declaratory relief and an injunction in the Los Angeles Superior Court The AG filed a motion to dismiss the Reliant action primarily on the grounds that the Government Code establishes the exclusive procedure for enforcement of this subpoena ie the AGs filing of a petition to enforce the subpoena the Government Code does not allow for the filing of injunctive relief and granting an injunction would violate the separation of powers and circumvent the special proceedings of the Government Code On May the Court denied the AGs demurrer The AG then agreed to a compromise interim protective order and Mirant and Reliant produced requested documents while reserving rights to continue the litigation II CASE OR CONTROVERSY UNDER ARTICLE III As an initial matter we considered whether an enforcement proceeding constitutes a case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution We conclude it probably does The power of federal courts is constitutionally limited to cases and controversies See Flast v Cohen US This doctrine limits the courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process Id at Furthermore Article III is intended to define the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assure that the federal courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government Id Applications of this doctrine include a finding of no justiciable controversy when the parties seek adjudication of only political questions when the parties are asking for only advisory opinions when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted by subsequent developments and where there is no standing to maintain the action Id This is not the issue here Upon the filing of a petition the AG will probably not dispute that there is a controversy The AG has conceded that as a matter of law there is no actual controversy in an investigatory proceeding until the Attorney General moves to enforce the subpoena AG Reply at We found no cases where removal of a similar petition was denied on the ground that it did not prevent a case or controversy under Article III III REMOVAL OF PETITION As discussed in our previous memorandum removal jurisdiction is conferred by federal statute See USC a This statute provides in relevant part that Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending As we previously concluded in order for EES to remove any enforcement action filed by the AG EES must show that the petition is a civil action under the removal statute and the AGs investigation which underlies the subpoena enforcement action is preempted by federal law thus making removal proper on the basis of federal question removal jurisdiction The AG likely will argue that that the petition to enforce the subpoena is not a civil action but rather is a special proceeding and that the petition does not present a federal question because it is undertaking an enforcement procedure created by California statutory which grants exclusive jurisdiction to California courts These arguments are analyzed below A AGs Argument That Petition is Not an Action First EES must show that a petition by the AG to enforce a subpoena is a civil action Under federal law the definition of civil action is extremely broad and appears to cover everything except criminal proceedings In our previous memorandum we concluded that EES has a good faith argument that a petition is a civil action for the purposes of removal In Reliant et al v Lockyer filed in the Superior Court County of Los Angeles the AG argued that petitions under the Government Code are special proceedings not civil actions The AGs arguments do not change our previous conclusions The AGs arguments are founded solely upon language in See People ex rel Franchise Tax Board v Superior Court CalAppd In that case the court of appeals stated that the hearing under section is a special proceeding In practice the term special proceeding is used in contradistinction to action it refers only to proceedings which were not under the common law or equity practice either an action at law or a suit in equity They are proceedings which may be commenced independently of a pending action by petition or motion upon notice in order to obtain special relief Id at Despite the AGs arguments Franchise Tax Board has no weight in determining whether the petition is a civil action under the federal removal statute Federal law determines whether there is an action is a civil action See eg In re Exhumation of Meriwether Lewis ND Tenn FSupp Without a doubt the term civil action has been construed broadly by the federal courts Wright Miller B Fed Practice and Proc Juris d West According to Wright Miller The limitation to civil actions is not particularly important however since the term civil action has been construed broadly by the federal courts For example proceedings for garnishment or condemnation and actions to compel arbitration or to confirm or vacate an arbitration award are considered civil actions within the meaning of the federal removal statute Moreover special federal statutes permit the removal of certain noncivil proceedings In effect therefore the limitation to civil actions in Section may mean no more than that state court criminal and perhaps penalty actions are not removable except as otherwise provided by a specific federal statute Applying a broad definition of civil action courts have held that petitions to exhume a body petition to enforce administrative subpoenas garnishment actions actions to compel arbitration and contempt proceedings are civil actions within the scope of Section See eg Agosto v Barcelo D P R F Supp enforcement of administrative subpoena overruled on other grounds st Cir Fd Lewis v Blackmon S D Miss F Supp garnishment action Sears Roebuck and Co v Glenwal Co SDNY F Supp action to compel arbitration Reynolds Metals Co v Crowther D Mass F Supp contempt proceeding In re Exhumation of Meriwether Lewis F Supp petition to exhume body Moreover the cases relied upon by the AG support the notion that the proceedings to enforce the subpoena are akin to an action See People ex rel Franchise Tax Board v Superior Court CalAppd in hearing on petition under the Government Code court may judicially test whether the subpoena duces tecum conforms to the requisite legal and constitutional standards Fielder v Berkeley Properties Co CalAppd hearing on petition to enforce a subpoena provides an opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights before one is required to obey the subpoena The AG also relies on Triple A Machine Shop Inc v California CalAppd This case is inapplicable Triple A has nothing to do with the application of the Government Code at issue or the enforcement of subpoenas under the Government Code Rather Triple A analyzed the propriety of enjoining criminal investigations In that case the San Francisco District Attorney and the State Department of Health commenced a criminal and civil investigation into violations of law governing the storage and disposal of hazardous waste The district attorney obtained a search warrant The district attorney also brought a suit to enjoin defendants from dissipating any assets Defendant filed an action for injunctive relief to enjoin the state from contacting high level managerial employees in violation of attorney client privilege and in violation of their ethical duties The injunction was issued The court of appeals reversed holding that there was no threat of misconduct by the district attorney or violations of the attorney client privilege The court further stated that The most significant effect of the injunction lies in its impact on the investigation and prosecution of the criminal charges The separation of powers doctrine requires judicial restraint in enjoining criminal investigations or prosecutions The discretionary authority vested in the district attorney to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct is considered too vital to the interest of public order to be subjected to prior restraint by the courts except under extraordinary circumstances Id at emphasis added EES is not asking the court to enjoin the AGs investigation EES is merely invoking the jurisdiction of the federal court pursuant to the federal removal statutes in order to litigate the legal and constitutional issues related to the AGs subpoena Thus Triple A is inapposite B The Petition Must Present a Federal Question Second EES must also argue that a federal question appears on the face of plaintiffs wellpleaded complaint or that plaintiffs artfully pleaded complaint involves a federal question As in the currently pending civil lawsuits EES will argue that the AGs investigation or some of it is completely preempted by the Federal Power Act which governs wholesale energy prices and thus presents a federal question Without a doubt this presents the biggest obstacle to successful removal especially since EES cannot inject a federal question sufficient to justify removal by way of defense This burden may be somewhat easier for Enron or Enron Wholesale services to meet since neither company does business on the retail level in California as EES does However as discussed in our previous memorandum both EES and Enron must contend with contrary Ninth Circuit precedent See Lewis v Younger th Cir Fd In addition the AG will argue that the petition does not present a federal question but is merely seeking to enforce a subpoena under the provisions of the Government Code which provides the exclusive means for adjudicating any dispute relating to an investigatory subpoena We will better know whether we have a reasonable chance to prevail on this issue when Judge Whaley rules on the currently pending remand motions This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain

<14093165.1075858668521.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-07-02 22:44:03,Status report on document identification at Enron Corp offices i n San Francisco Cc B NonPrivilegedpst Amanda Smith Peter Meringolo and I met with officers and administrators at the San Francisco offices of Enron Corp this morning and identified documents responsive to the Dunn committee subpoena Amanda and Peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in the afternoon They will continue to do so with the assistance of two paralegals tomorrow Assuming we do not produce documents relating to the development and siting of generation facilities which comprise the lions chair of the documents in San Francisco we estimate there are about ten boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office However we have not yet reviewed any electronic documents The following summarizes these discussions and the status of document identification Most of the documents in the SF office correspond to one of the three major functions of the office The predominant operation is the development of power generation facilities in the Western United States under the supervision of Dave Parquet Second the office markets wholesale power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of Mike McDonald Both these operations are done by Enron North American and both Parquay and McDonald are vice presidents of Enron North America McDonald works closely with EPMI in Portland The final significant function of the office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs which is part of Enron Corp and managed by Sue Mara We reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons working under the management of Parquet and Mara McDonald is on vacation until June and has not returned phone calls to his home message machine Given his close relationship to EPMI in Portland we need to reach him soon to interview him on the subject He is said to have potentially sensitive pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his hard drive The following summarizes our review of the documents in the Parquet and Mara supervised operations Mara Many documents may be privileged Nonprivileged documents do not appear especially sensitive examples are reports of trade association meetings and PUC and other regulatory proceedings Parquet Parquet was on the board of ISO He has about two boxes of responsive ISO information Most appear non sensitive but may require notice to ISO prior to production There is also some bid information regarding an Enron offer to buy a PG and E generating facility later purchased by Mirant These documents are also nonsensitive Parquet has financial documents including the allocation of profit and loss to certain Enron subsidiaries However there are tens to of boxes of documents relating to power plants Enron has or is planning to develop in the Western United States Generally these type of documents do not appear called for in the subpoena However embedded within these development plans are documents that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive such as pricing curves information about future contracts and forecasts of supply and demand for power Parquay says these are competitively sensitive documents It would take several days to review these documents Further many contain third party information subject to confidentiality agreements with such third parties If we produce them we would need to notify these third parties soon I suggest we not produce these documents but do so openly by disclosing to Drivon that we are treating documents relating to siting of power plants not operated by Enron as nonresponsive McDonald This operating unit has few hard copy documents Most sensitive information is said to be on McDonalds hard drive including financial information that reportedly shows how much money Enron made in California in the past year or two by selling wholesale power Someone needs to reach McDonald so we can ask him about it Document retention The office manager says that a backup tape is made of the server and the H drives on each computer every day days of backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten The backup tape from every fourth Friday of each month is kept permanently They believe email is so preserved on this back up tapes but say that only people in Houston know for sure We should find out We asked the office manager to retain copies of all backup tapes going forward EES The EES personnel in San Francisco have few responsive documents The Dunn subpoena asks for all of Enrons contracts for retail sale of power which are also requested by the AG from EES These probably total or so boxes We will ask the EES offices in San Ramon and Costa Mesa offices which house these contracts to copy them and send them to us for our review We will hold them until we make a decision whether to produce them either to the AG or Dunn PUC production Enron previously produced about a half box of documents to the PUC Most are responsive and should be also produced to Dunn I expect we will have completed at least a cursory

missed you by phone this morning and will call again when you return this afternoonWe have stopped plans to copy the EES contracts with customers for power pending further discussions with you Here are the considerations that seem relevant Both the AG and Dunn subpoenas request these contracts and supporting documents They are probably the only significant amount of EES documents in California that are responsive to the Dunn subpoena They are currently kept in several places in the San Ramon office Costa Mesa and Long Beach If we plan to gather them for a production in or around Sacramento soon we should consider making copies of the Southern California contracts so they are available for review and production in Northern California The extent of the Southern California contract documents is about four or five boxes San Ramon probably has about ten We could more easily hold off on the copying in San Ramon since it is close both to our offices and Sacramento It is unlikely we can shift copying costs for these documents to Dunns committee or the AG We could produce them in a central location but I doubt we can force them to go to several locations in the state to review documents that fall in this category Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday July AM To Cc Subject RE Status report on document identification at Enron Corp offices i n San Francisco Michael before we go to the expense of copying the EES contracts I want to see if Mike Kirby can convince the Committee that those contracts have no relevance to its investigation which in fact they dont Also why should Enron bear the costs of this massive document production The federal courts at least in Houston require the party seeking discovery to pay the cost If we conclude that we have to pay for this maybe we should make the contracts available in a room for their review Please call me Thanks Original Message From Molland Michael E ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESMollandCMichaelEECMMollandbrobeck EcomE

Francisco Amanda Smith Peter Meringolo and I met with officers and administrators at the San Francisco offices of Enron Corp this morning and identified documents responsive to the Dunn committee subpoena Amanda and Peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in the afternoon They will continue to do so with the assistance of two paralegals tomorrow Assuming we do not produce documents relating to the development and siting of generation facilities which comprise the lions chair of the documents in San Francisco we estimate there are about ten boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office However we have not yet reviewed any electronic documents The following summarizes these discussions and the status of document identification Most of the documents in the SF office correspond to one of the three major functions of the office The predominant operation is the development of power generation facilities in the Western United States under the supervision of Dave Parquet Second the office markets wholesale power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of Mike McDonald Both these operations are done by Enron North American and both Parquay and McDonald are vice presidents of Enron North America McDonald works closely with EPMI in Portland The final significant function of the office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs which is part of Enron Corp and managed by Sue Mara We reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons working under the management of Parquet and Mara McDonald is on vacation until June and has not returned phone calls to his home message machine Given his close relationship to EPMI in Portland we need to reach him soon to interview him on the subject He is said to have potentially sensitive pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his hard drive The following summarizes our review of the documents in the Parquet and Mara supervised operations Mara Many documents may be privileged Nonprivileged documents do not appear especially sensitive examples are reports of trade association meetings and PUC and other regulatory proceedings Parquet Parquet was on the board of ISO He has about two boxes of responsive ISO information Most appear non sensitive but may require notice to ISO prior to production There is also some bid information regarding an Enron offer to buy a PG and E generating facility later purchased by Mirant These documents are also nonsensitive Parquet has financial documents including the allocation of profit and loss to certain Enron subsidiaries However there are tens to of boxes of documents relating to power plants Enron has or is planning to develop in the Western United States Generally these type of documents do not appear called for in the subpoena However embedded within these development plans are documents that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive such as pricing curves information about future contracts and forecasts of supply and demand for power Parquay says these are competitively sensitive documents It would take several days to review these documents Further many contain third party information subject to confidentiality agreements with such third parties If we produce them we would need to notify these third parties soon I suggest we not produce these documents but do so openly by disclosing to Drivon that we are treating documents relating to siting of power plants not operated by Enron as nonresponsive McDonald This operating unit has few hard copy documents Most sensitive information is said to be on McDonalds hard drive including financial information that reportedly shows how much money Enron made in California in the past year or two by selling wholesale power Someone needs to reach McDonald so we can ask him about it Document retention The office manager says that a backup tape is made of the server and the H drives on each computer every day days of backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten The backup tape from every fourth Friday of each month is kept permanently They believe email is so preserved on this back up tapes but say that only people in Houston know for sure We should find out We asked the office manager to retain copies of all backup tapes going forward EES The EES personnel in San Francisco have few responsive documents The Dunn subpoena asks for all of Enrons contracts for retail sale of power which are also requested by the AG from EES These probably total or so boxes We will ask the EES offices in San Ramon and Costa Mesa offices which house these contracts to copy them and send them to us for our review We will hold them until we make a decision whether to produce them either to the AG or Dunn PUC production Enron previously produced about a half box of documents to the PUC Most are responsive and should be also produced to Dunn I expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of the responsive hard copy documents in San Francisco that do not pertain to plant construction and operation by tomorrow afternoon We then need to review the documents on the hard drives of Parquay and McDonald hopefully by Thursday afternoon We will collect examples of the most sensitive documents we find tomorrow and send them Tuesday evening to Bob

to make a motion asking the court to shift the cost of restoring the tapes if unduly burdensome to a party requesting the information Greyhound Corporation v Superior Court Cald In Greyhound the California Supreme Court held where a valid objection to disclosure is that it entails an undue burden on the other party the trial court should give consideration to various alternatives provided in the statute Requiring such party to pay the costs of disclosure is not the only such method The balancing factors suggested by the Greyhound court include the purpose of the information sought the effect that disclosure would have on the parties and the trial the nature of the objections urged the hardship of production the relative ability of the parties to retrieve the information sought and the courts authority to make another order using another form of disclosure or denying the requests completely Despite this case I suspect we will have a difficult convincing a California Superior

generally described the documents in the office He describes most as confidential or proprietary He will assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with Amanda and me and two other associates Monday morning We should be able to complete a snapshot of the documents in the office by mid Tuesday Our discussions raised the following issues Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near Palm Springs Enron Wind Energy It generates and sells power to utilities The Enron subpoena asks for generation data We will contact them Monday by phone EES has a small office in Long Beach Amanda will talk to their employees Monday A Master Limited Partnership EOTT Energy also has an office in Long Beach They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp Please let us know if we should contact him Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality agreements with Enrons clients Dave said the confidentiality of these documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron attorney in Portland he suggested Karen Jones to work on this issue with us Document Retention David said he is concerned that there is no clear corporate guideline for email retention in his office We should send him and the directors in that office as well as all EES directors a clear directive as soon as possible For the time being he is following oral instructions not to delete email or other documents Earlier Amanda talked the EES IT manager who said that it is not possible to automatically save email from most EES personnel in California those who are on the legacy email system Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the daily backup tapes made for the legacy system just as we are doing for our Portland office Telephone call with AGs office regarding the EES subpoena This afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel a deputy AG who is temporarily in charge of the EES investigation I told him we would produce some documents without waiving our objections but needed to discuss any production with him beforehand I repeated Bobs offer to meet next Friday He said they would not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in writing we would produce documents I told him we had no obligation to do that and wanted to meet with them first He then said he would have his supervisor call me early next week Directives to California officers All the EES and Enron people we have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative Given the time crunch however it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with the document review The people to contact are Messrs Reilly ParquetMcDonald MaraWright van Ulden and the head of the Enron Wind

<5948084.1075858668674.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-06-27 18:01:41,Discussion of document retention policy for EES Cc B NonPrivilegedpst Bob Williams Andrew Edison Michael Molland Amanda Smith and two IT professionals working with EES Jon Eastlund and Pete van de Gohn today discussed a going forward document retention policy for EES as a result of the California AGs subpoena This is a summary of our discussion Agreement with AG with respect to EPMIPortland I per my conversation with Gary Fergus confirmed that the document retention policy that was negotiated in December with the AG with respect to EPMI in Portland is as follows All employees are instructed not to delete any email for hours Each hours a backup snapshot of the entire email server in Portland is taken After hours employees may delete email This policy has been in place since midDecember and backup tapes should exist for email for each day from midDecember through the present Description of Email server organization within EES All EES employees are on one of two email systems the exchange serverLegacy system or Lotus Notes The exchangeLegacy system is run off of three servers located in San Ramon California Costa Mesa California and Phoenix Arizona The Lotus Notes server is in Houston The majority of EES personnel in California probably are on the exchangeLegacy server but there is no way of knowing who is which server without individually checking EES personnel who were originally hired in California probably use the Legacy system Generally the only inCalifornia personnel who use the Lotus Notes system are those who were originally hired by EES to work outside of California Virtually all EES employees outside California use the Lotus Notes system Current email retention of Legacy system The customary practice is to keep daily back up tapes which are over written weekly as well as one weekly snapshot of the system which is overwritten after days As of last week the exchangeLegacy server is being preserved as follows the daily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are being preserved by Jon Eastlund Jon is checking with his subordinate in Costa Mesa to confirm that this is also being done in Costa Mesa Jon reports that the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates from May th He is keeping that tape in San Ramon until it can be picked up by Brobeck Retention of email of Lotus Notes System The Lotus Notes server is backed up every day but the back tapes are erased after seven days and this policy is continuing As of several weeks ago when B Williams first sent out notification to Pete Van de Gohn and the IT staff in Houston the Lotus Notes server is being preserved as follows the auto purge and the delete functions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled for certain EES personneleg Sunde and Benevides In addition more recently the auto purge function was disabled on the computers of additional personnel the Golden Bear team who use the system As of today Pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnel as well Going forward we discussed several different policies that EES might institute First we discussed the idea of instituting a policy like that in place at EPMI in Portland ie preserving the daily back up tapes that are already being made but overwritten after a week or soin the ordinary course of business This policy will create a significant amount of information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it is requested However it is apparently consistent with the policy in place at EPMI Portland and is possible to do on both email systems Second as an alternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the delete function on the computers of key personnel This is now being done for the Lotus Notes system However we understand that the exchangeLegacy system may not have an auto purge function Jon will check whether the delete disabling function can be accomplished on the exchangeLegacy system and report back This second alternative preserves email that will be relatively easy to search for production However it may be difficult to implement for California personal on the legacy email system Third we discussed instructing key EES personnel at issue to move all potentially responsive emails into folders on the system which may they be protected reproduced and reviewedThis would be the least burdensome potentially leaves us open to the fox is guarding the henhouse argument by the AG Data ServersWe discussed data servers briefly All personnel are on different servers for their word documents and spread sheets This system has no autopurge function However the only way that a document can be deleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the system Accordingly there seems less need to initiate further backup of this server Finally we agreed EES lawyers should send emails to all key EES personnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not delete email documents or messages A draft email on this subject follows This email confirms that EES has instituted an interim document retention policy as a result of the investigation commenced by the California Attorney General Until further notice please do not delete any nonpersonal email from your inbox or any documents from the data servers In lieu of deleting any of your email please transfer it to a folder in your email system for storage If you need instructions on how to do this please

investigative subpoenas Cc B NonPrivilegedpst We are continuing to identify and review potentially responsive documents within California called for by the subpoena issued by Dunns Committee to Enron Corp and by the California AGs subpoenas to Enron Energy Services Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith are leading this effort at our office This is our report on the status of this document identification and our plans subject to your direction to continue this effort next week The last section of the memo poses certain logistical questions and issues regarding the production to Dunns Committee that Mike Kirby should address as soon as possible I Status of EES Response to Subpoena from AG As we previously reported we have completed a preliminary investigation of documents in the EESs offices in California which are responsive to the subpoena from the attorney general Below is a report of documents collected documents we need to collect soon and action items which we still need to do in order to identify responsive documents A Documents Collected We have copies of the following documents Contracts from the San Ramon office Contracts and documents relating to the contracts from Costa Mesa office B Documents to Collect We previously identified the following relevant documents However we have not yet collected them into one central location Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities These documents are on Mojgan Ahads hard drive in files labeled California Rapid Response and California Strike Force and email Golden Bear documents in San Ramon Costa Mesa and Long Beach Files related to status of EDIs re return of customers to PGE Presently kept by Summer Intern Kerri Bernstein Documents related to the returning customers to the Utilities These documents are on Mojgan Ahads hard drive in files labeled California Rapid Response and California Strike Force and email Golden Bear documents in San Ramon Costa Mesa and Long Beach Files related to status of EDIs re return of customers to PGE Presently kept by Summer Intern Kerri Bernstein Documents related to each contract in the possession of each account manager in San Ramon Current and Old Organization charts C Action Items To complete our review of the relevant documents in California we plan to do the following Review emails and hard drives of Tom Riley Dirk van Ulden Mojgan Ahad and Jim Wright Interview and review documents in the possession of Originators in Long Beach II Status of Enron Corporations Response to Subpoena from Senator Dunn We are prepared to produce more than pages of documents to the Sacramento repository on Monday in response to the subpoena from Senator Dunn This memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved before Enrons production of documents in California is complete This memorandum is divided into three sections substantive issues to be resolved documents remaining to be reviewed and logistical issues to be addressed by Mike Kirby A Substantive Issues We have prepared and sent to Mike Kirby and Richard Sanders and others a packet of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible We need guidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents These documents include Bids made to DWR ISO The subpoena calls for bids made to the ISO and PX and we assume that this means bid data However Enron did submit bids to provide for Summer Reliability Generation and to provide energy to the DWR Should we produce these documents Enron Business Plans These documents talk in general terms about strategies for developing revenue in California not necessarily forecasts of revenue These documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked for by the subpoena Siting Generation Development documents This is a broad category of documents which are irrelevant to the Senate investigation However if the subpoena is broadly and perhaps fairly read many documents within this category may be responsive Our suggestion is to carve out these documents and let the Senate Committee know that we are doing so For example Dunn asks for information about generation units owned or controlled by Enron We found documents in which Enron controlled the development of the unit but then sold it to a third party Likewise Enron is involved in a project to expand Las Vegas CoGen facility Many of these documents contain financial data such as supply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to go forward with the project We have numerous proposal and drafts but not finalized deals in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy the energy from the facility These drafts are not called for by the subpoena but documents related to final contracts are We have gathered documents related to negotiations with QFs to serve as Scheduling Coordinators which apparently coincide with divestiture by the utilities Documents related to meetings of the Independent Energy Producers IEP trade association These documents clearly are responsive Many however contain sensitive and privilege information including information about lobbying efforts Thus we need to provide notice to the IEP that we are required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity to review these documents before we produce them Additionally we should contact their counsel to see what if anything has already been produced I assume that they have been subpoenaed B Enron Corp Documents in San Francisco yet to be Reviewed We have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materials maintained in the San Francisco office We will complete this review next week and produce any additional documents to the repository The following is a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed Electronic documents on Sue Maras hard drive Email messages maintained by Dave Parquet Mike McDonald and Sue Mara Interview Mike McDonald Review addition materials relating to QFs recently located by Enron C Logistical Issues and Questions for Mike Kirby Delivering boxes to Sacramento repository We need someone to drive the boxes to Sacramento and obtain a key for the repository space Bob Webb a senior paralegal has volunteered if we need him to go Staffing the Sacramento repository We assume that we will need a proctor when the Senate Committee reviews the documents Can we work out a schedule or protocol with them Moreover we will need to have someone drive to Sacramento each time we produce documents We cannot simply federal express or messenger the documents because there is no one to receive them Confidential Stamping We have not marked anything Confidential Should we do that now or should we wait until the Senate selects documents for copying

<27117735.1075858668852.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-07-16 21:33:20,Meetings with EES Employees in Houston Benevides Whalon Bresna n LewisB NonPrivilegedpst Here is my report attached as a word document on my recent meetings with EES employees Jubran Whalon Neil Bresnan Dennis Benevides Jay Lewis and Scott Stoness in Houston A description of their account of the documents in Houston which appear to be called for by the AGs subpena to EES follows in the text of this email Discussion of Specific Document Requests No All contracts for retail sale These are both in California and Houston Nos and All contracts under which EES has purchased electricity on the western interconnection between and the end of About five percent of these contracts are for green power made with various entities The vast majority approximately are contracts with EPMI which purchased all electricity load for EES There may be also a few contracts with APX EES has paper fax copies of all these deals Their understanding is that EPMI charged EES exactly what the utilities would have paid on the California market While they do not know how EPMI actually provided for the power they believe EPMI probably did not buy most of it on the California market They believe all these contracts are voidable if they are revealed to any third party They characterize all this information as extremely sensitive They believe with this information if given enough time and a few other variables parties could construct Enrons price curves No Documents which identify the purchases of EES for power in the day ahead hour ahead or real time markets operated by the PX or Cal ISO They say there are none EES was a scheduling coordinator but never used the function No Documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied upon EES to meet contractual obligations to NUs customers in California There are no such documents No Documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding the cost of purchasing electricity in California They do not believe there are such documents but there may be presentations on this issue No Documents relating to strategies or business plans designed to minimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessary to serve customers All EES officers and traders receive daily reports to corporate goals for EES and show how EES was performing in conformity with these goals They characterized these documents as extremely sensitive They use these on a daily basis Most of these goals are based upon the price curves They also receive month end reports which show how each division is doing according to these corporate goals They believe that a corporate function called Risk Control would have custody of these reports Vladimir Gorny sp was said to be the person in charge of these No Documents relating to decisions to return direct access customers to default utility distributors in California including documents relating to cost savings They believe these documents exist in Houston They believe there are spreadsheets which show the cost savings or revenue enhancements that EES would have received as a result of returning customers to utilities They believe Don Black would have these They believe all these documents would reveal price curves No Communications relating to the return of direct access customers in California There may be spreadsheets which exist on this subject They believe that Don Black would have them No Documents sufficient to identify persons most knowledgeable about decisions made to return direct access customers in California These would be the same documents as No No Documents related to the assessment of the dramatic increases in electricity in California They dont know if these documents exist or not There may be some presentations on the subject No All documents relating to strategy and business plans designed to maximize revenues from the sale of electricity in California They construe this request to refer to origination documents These would be with the person that was in charge of selling services in California during the period in question They believe Doug Condon sp or Harold Buchanan would have these documents No Documents that show sales to California Department of Water Resources They dont believe there are such documents Nos Contracts obligating them to either supply or purchase electricity which they prematurely terminated They dont believe there are any contracts which they prematurely terminated Some contracts were terminated but by agreement The only possible exception may be the University of California contract No Organizational charts which show the persons with authority for risk management They believe Dave Delaney or Marty Sunde Vice Chairman of EES might have such charts No Documents relating to risk management of trading activities on California markets for electricity or natural gas and pipeline capacity These again may be guidelines which Delaney or Sunde might have No Organizational charts regarding those who have responsibility for approving charters and objectives for making risk management decisions They believe Jess Hewitts department might have these They believe these refer to risk management procedures to prevent conflict of interest among EES traders No Documents relating to development approval of charters and objectives for making risk management decisions They believe there is a master agreement on this subject They believe Rick Byers sp might have this agreement They also believe this request refers to guidelines regarding conflict of interest for traders under their risk management policies Nos Documents which identify financial and ownership positions of natural gas or capacity to deliver and transport natural gas to California Gas contracts are handled by a different department at EES They believe that some of these gas contracts were purchased by EPMI but had no direct knowledge of them They believe EES may have purchased its own gas or pipeline capacity because EES has the necessary credit to accomplish this EES had its own power desk that scheduled gas However they probably purchased most of it from Enron North America ees houston meetingsdoc This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and

<15099157.1075858669120.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mmolland@brobeck.com,2001-07-20 10:21:40,FW Atty Gen Subpena Enforcement procedures and related tactical issues for Enron Cc B NonPrivilegedpst Bob You asked us to analyze our trial court and appellate tactics in the face of the enforcement proceeding filed against EES by the AG yesterday My partner Tom Peterson drawing on the earlier work of Peter Meringolo and Amanda Smith looked at this issue yesterday afternoon and I have discussed it with him Here briefly is our initial analysis The bottom line if EES decides to raise issues relating the confidentiality of the documents and the bias of Lockyer in conjunction with the enforcement action it probably needs to file either a cross complaint or separate action with the court to address to these issues Mike and I will call you when we return from court this afternoon to discuss this further A summary of Toms initial analysis follows Under Gov code section the AG probably must file the contemplated special proceeding to enforce the subpoena and obtain an order compelling production before proceeding further Under section the language shall suggests there is no discretion about the issuance of the order to show cause which acts like a summons and probably only is adjudicatory in the sense that it specifies dates by which the issues on the petition will be joined See also Brovelli Cald Therefore we probably cannot object to the proceedings today being conducted before a Commissioner We probably can object if he refuses to order a hearing before a superior court judge The limits of the review available by the court concerning issues raised by an enforcement action under section are unclear The statute says that the court shall order compliance with the subpoena if it appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued There is case law suggesting on the one hand that this scheme provides an opportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rights before one is required to obey the command of a subpoena duces tecum issued for investigative purposes People v West Coast CalAppd at On the other hand the court has no power to grant equitable remedies and a party is not entitled to all of the protections by way of hearing and the like that might be available by way of a motion to quash Fiedler CalAppd at see also Franchise Tax CalAppd at On the one hand it would seem that we should be able to argue territoriality objectionsthese seem jurisdictional and related to the power of the AG On the other hand we cant get any relief like a declaration or an injunction because that is equitable This seems to have been a major part of the reason that Reliant etc sued in a separate action in LA because they wanted to enjoin the AG from sharing the material that they produced to the AG Of course if we can assert objections as legal and constitutional reasons not to produce we may not need equitable relief just an order finding that the administrative subpoena is not regularly issued under the Gov Code scheme It is very unclear as to whether possible objection on the ground that the AG should be disqualified could be considered by the court as part of the AGs enforcement action One might be able to argue that a lawfully constituted and conducted investigation by a duly qualified officer is part of the calculation implicit in regularly issued Conversely a disqualification motion is not within the contemplation of the immediate code sections surrounding section and the court might consider this such a significant motion that it would be reluctant to think it proper under the Gov Code scheme In view of we may want to file an action for declaratory relief either because we really think that the section proceeding may not be the proper vehicle to adjudicate our objections or because we want to take away any issue for the AG who will probably assert that an enforcement action under the government code permits only very narrow review We could therefore file such an action and say that we are doing this because we want to obviate any procedural issues and clear the path so we can get the court to resolve all the disputes and not have a piecemeal process Assuming we decide for whatever reason to file an action for declaratory relief we could file our own action and try to get it joined with the section proceeding or we could consider filing a crosscomplaint in the section action The ability to do the latter is debatable There is a wellrecognized difference under the California codes between an action and a special proceeding The Gov Code matter is a special proceeding In Tide Water the supreme court said that under the then prevailing crosscomplaint statute a suit for special proceeding would not support a crosscomplaint Cal d at However the code has since been amended and may permit a cross complaint for the following reasons First CCP section now uses the word action in a border sense It says a party may file a crosscomplaint against any other party who has filed a complaint against him It says that this does not authorize a crosscomplaint under section but that code section isnt an action in the code sense but a special proceeding so you can say the meaning of the word action in the old section construed by the supreme court in Tide Water has been completely changed and the Legislature has now expanded the definition to refer to a proceeding in court whether an action or a special proceeding The AG will probably argue that the Gov Code action is commenced by a petition rather than a complaint and thus will not support a cross complaint we would need to analyze this further Also in support of filing a crosscomplaint under the new amended code is CCP section a which says that the compulsory crosscomplaint rules do not apply to special proceedings If the parts of the CCP applicable to joinder did not otherwise apply to special proceedings then there would not be any reason to codify this carve out Finally Tide Water says that the court has discretion based on inherent power CCP section to entertain what would otherwise amount to an unauthorized crosscomplaint appended to a special proceeding NB a Be aware that there is some authority for the idea that parts of the CCP applicable to actions Part do not apply to special proceedings unless expressly incorporated See ALRB CalAppd at compare CCP adopting action rules into special proceedings of mandate review and prohibition b Be aware that an action for declaratory relief is itself a special proceeding In summary we should consider responding to the AGs case with a crosscomplaint for declaratory relief or file one independently Wed lean toward the crosscomplaint and take our chances on a motion to dismiss it procedurally since we think the court would want to get all the issues resolved There is a split of authority on whether the disposition of the section proceeding is appealable I think it may be a distinction without a practical difference since a writ of mandate is available If we want to seek appellate review of an order for us to produce issued under the Gov Code whether we proceed by appeal or writ of mandateprohibition we would have to make a prompt filling and seek urgent relief and the issue would come to a head that way by the decision whether or not to defer compliance while appellate review proceeds This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged
