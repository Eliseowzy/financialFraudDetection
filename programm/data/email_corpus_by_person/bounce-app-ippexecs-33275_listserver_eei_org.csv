order mobilizes FERCs entire energy pricing and infrastructure authority To adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission facilities Streamlines regulation of wholesale market energy facilities siting and licensing Promotes conservation and wholesale side of demandresponse bidding Order doesnt address price caps Meeting with Western state regulatorsofficials set for April in Boise Idaho FERC moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the stressed California and Western energy markets FERC proposes to increase bulk power supply in the West by removing barriers and providing incentives that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification licensing and the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce FERC quickly wants to increase electric generation and transmission capacity as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale power transactions as well as increase the capacity of the supporting infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines The order which sets new precedent in its broadness also proposes actions to reduce electricity demand in the West as well as promoting the necessary wholesalemarket portion of demandresponse bidding where states wish to implement the retail side FERC asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future by March Effective immediately FERC said in a statement the Commission is streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into California and the West including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly address pending pipeline applications and urging all licensees to review their FERClicensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential for increased generating capacity Among the actions FERC takes are to require the California ISO and transmission owners within all states of the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed in the short term waive prior notice requirements for any onsite or selfgenerators that sell at wholesale within the WSCC area grant blanket marketbased rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric energy that becomes available as a result of demandresponse reductions in retail and wholesale loads and broadening and extending through December the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for qualifying facilities QFs to increase the availability of generating capacity FERC seeks comments by March on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid including an increased rate of return on equity ROE for projects that significantly increase transmission and can be in service by either June or November Other areas that FERC requested comment on include the use of interconnection authority under the Federal Power Act and to raise the dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas pipeline construction On hydro issues FERC requested comment on ways to increase operating flexibility at FERClicensed projects while protecting environmental resources In its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure FERC asked for comments again by March on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring upgrades to the Western interconnection including the increased ROE for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in Increased ROE FERC said will also be given to system upgrades over new transmission paths that can be in service by June or November FERC seeks comment on a proposed year depreciation period for projects that increase transmission capacity in the shortterm and a year depreciation period for upgrades involving new rightsofway that can be of service by November In his dissent to the order Commissioner Massey argued the order focuses on quick fixes and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in demand in California The order also fails to address price relief noted Massey Massey also called for a full Federal Power Act FPA Section investigation of California issues which would allow for the possibility of refunds On transmission incentive provisions Massey lamented that the proposed ROE increase to percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with FERC policy under Order No The financial provisions he said appeared to be just throwing money at the problem While generally disappointed with the order Massey did express limited support for many parts of the order Many of the suggestions in the order are the same actions as authorized last May said Massey They were good ideas then and they are good ideas now he concluded For his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted Chairman Hebert said the order was designed to squeeze every additional MW of supply available and to encourage the conservation of MW and stressed that FERC is doing all it can in its power to alleviate Western problems He said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in California but noted that generationtransmission siting and conservation are generally state issues FERCs removing obstacles order is posted on its web site

March Docket No EL A detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals made follows Electric Transmission Infrastructure Within days the California ISO and transmission owners in WSCC are to prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of rights of way FERC proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at present constraints and can be in service by July would receive a costbased rate reflecting a basis point premium return on equity and a year depreciable life Projects in service by November would get a basis point premium and year depreciable life FERC would use a uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission providers in WSCC of based on the ROE FERC approved for Southern California Edison System upgrades that involve new rights of way add significant transfer capability and can be in service by November would get a costbased rate reflecting ROE or a basis point premium and year depreciable life Facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid which go into service as required to accommodate the inservice date of the new plant would get a costbased rate that reflected a ROE or a basis point premium if in service by November and ROE if in service by November For increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not involve significant capital investments for example installing new technology FERC proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each additional MW of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm pointtopoint rate FERC requests comment on whether to assign the cost of any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply or alternatively to roll these costs into the average system rate Extension of Waivers for QFs FERC proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency standards for QFs applicable throughout WSCC to allow increased generation through December The waivers were to expire on April The proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this output to purchasing utility The waiver for qualifying small power production facilities in WSCC with respect to their fuel use requirements under FERC regulation section b would be extended to December Additional Capacity From OnSite Generation FERC will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale sales from such facilities that serve load within WSCC Through December owners of generating facilities located at business locations in WSCC and used primarily for backup or self generation who would become subject to FPA by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at wholesale without prior notice under FPA section FERC also authorizes such power to be sold at marketbased rates FERC waives its prior notice requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales Quarterly reporting is required Allows Demand Response Bidding FERC will allow retail customers as permitted by state law and wholesale customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale FERC is granting blanket authorization consistent with its prior discussion on sales from onsite generation and requires similar reporting FERCs December order on the California market directed as a longerterm measure that the ISO pursue establishing an integrated dayahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue FERC seeks comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this FERC says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for resale in wholesale markets raises legal commercial technical and regulatory issues Safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail demandresponse bidding programs Intention is not to undermine state programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs Requests comments on how

respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring immediate action Longer Term Regional Solutions FERC believes an RTO for the entire western region or the seamless integration of Western RTOs is the best vehicle for designing and implementing a longterm regional solution Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity FERC has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve California and the West Requests comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new

Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies S was approved with two amendments Offered by Sen Mike Enzi RWY the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States The task force would be made up of representatives of FERC the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission as well as nonvoting representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission The amendment also contained a provision cosponsored by Sen Paul Sarbanes DMD that woul d preserve FERCs authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and d o not include the passthrough of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy Another amendment offered by Sen Jon Corzine DNJ initiated a study by the General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governmen ts in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets Institutes Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hi ll The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association APPA and the Large Public Power Council LPPC again has been introduced in the House The bill HR contains the same provisions as were in a measure HR with technical corrections introduced during the th Congress HR was introduced by Rep JD Hayworth RAZ and nine original cosponsors from the Ways and Means Committee HR contains four key provisions with tax code changes The taxfre e sale or spinoff of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed Nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to costof service ratemaking The contributions in aid of construction CIAC tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated and Private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distributio n facilities The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee and EEI has urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward Enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment the Institute noted The same legislation has been incorporated into S Senate Energ y Committee Chairman Frank Murkowskis RAK energy security bill and standalone legislation could also be introduced Hearings are expected to be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees probably after consideration of President Bushs individual tax proposal ADMINISTRATIONFERC White House Seeks Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year President Bush last week transmitted a trillion fiscal year budget request to Capitol Hill The Administration noted that its proposal moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percen t in an increase of billion over the preceding fiscal year The budget bid contains a billion total surplus in and projects a trillion surplus over the next ten years In the energy area the Administration noted the federal governments longstanding and evolving role in the sector pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts It proposed about billion in discretionary spending for energy program s and about billion in tax benefits mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources DOEs budget request was billion including billion for energy resources programs This later figure represents a decrease of million or percent from fiscal year In the environmental sector the Administration sought some billion in discretionary funding for EPA including a billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy FERCs Massey As serts Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy and its success is in the hands of regulators and policymakers FERC Commissioner William Massey has asserted Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum in Philadelphia Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to th e key elements of a national energy strategy First he specified there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity Turning to a second element Commissioner Massey told forum attendees that all the supply in the world wont help unless it can b e delivered over an adequate efficient nondiscriminatory network Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy while citing an inherent difficulty that good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions Accordingly he said FERC and the states must work togeth er on market structure The final element of a successful energy strategy the commissioner specified is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail t o do their job If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulat or to ensure reasonable prices for consumers he cautioned they will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path

Alliance Express newsletter and a special announcement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB FASB FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No that will exempt energy companies from the requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives A vote again st the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers Attached is a summary of this issue The Board is expected to vote on this issue during May EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns If you or company CFO would like more information about this effort please contact Richard McMahon Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy Suppliers at or at Alliance of Energy Suppliers ExpressApri l INSIDE WASHINGTON FEDERAL AFFAIRS Bill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee The Senate Banking Committee today approved S a bill that repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of The bill would repeal PUHCA an d transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies S was approved with two amendments Offered by Sen Mike Enzi RWY the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States The task force would be made up of representatives of FERC the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission as well as nonvoting representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission The amendment also contained a provision cosponsored by Sen Paul Sarbanes DMD that woul d preserve FERCs authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and d o not include the passthrough of holding company costs that are unrelated to energy Another amendment offered by Sen Jon Corzine DNJ initiated a study by the General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governmen ts in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets Institutes Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hi ll The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association APPA and the Large Public Power Council LPPC again has been introduced in the House The bill HR contains the same provisions as were in a measure HR with technical corrections introduced during the th Congress HR was introduced by Rep JD Hayworth RAZ and nine original cosponsors from the Ways and Means Committee HR contains four key provisions with tax code changes The taxfre e sale or spinoff of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed Nuclear decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to costof service ratemaking The contributions in aid of construction CIAC tax on interconnections to transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated and Private use tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distributio n facilities The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee and EEI has urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward Enactment will help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment the Institute noted The same legislation has been incorporated into S Senate Energ y Committee Chairman Frank Murkowskis RAK energy security bill and standalone legislation could also be introduced Hearings are expected to be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees probably after consideration of President Bushs individual tax proposal ADMINISTRATIONFERC White House Seeks Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year President Bush last week transmitted a trillion fiscal year budget request to Capitol Hill The Administration noted that its proposal moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percen t in an increase of billion over the preceding fiscal year The budget bid contains a billion total surplus in and projects a trillion surplus over the next ten years In the energy area the Administration noted the federal governments longstanding and evolving role in the sector pointing out that most federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts It proposed about billion in discretionary spending for energy program s and about billion in tax benefits mainly to encourage development of traditional and alternative energy sources DOEs budget request was billion including billion for energy resources programs This later figure represents a decrease of million or percent from fiscal year In the environmental sector the Administration sought some billion in discretionary funding for EPA including a billion operating program focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy FERCs Massey As serts Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy and its success is in the hands of regulators and policymakers FERC Commissioner William Massey has asserted Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum in Philadelphia Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to th e key elements of a national energy strategy First he specified there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy commodity Turning to a second element Commissioner Massey told forum attendees that all the supply in the world wont help unless it can b e delivered over an adequate efficient nondiscriminatory network Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential element of a national energy strategy while citing an inherent difficulty that good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail jurisdictions Accordingly he said FERC and the states must work togeth er on market structure The final element of a successful energy strategy the commissioner specified is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail t o do their job If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulat or to ensure reasonable prices for consumers he cautioned they will surely think twice before heading down the restructuring path NEW GENERATION Dynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky Dynegy has announced plans to construct a new megawatt plant adjacent t o the Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County Kentucky Dynegy will sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market Commercial operation is expected to begin first quarter of PPL To Expand Generation Capacity PPL Corporation this week said it would build a megawatt power plant ne ar Chicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by megawatts CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be in service by the summer of Constellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants Constellation Energy Group this week announced that the company is schedul ed to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer Additionally four larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two summers The four peaking plants are located in Illinois Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia The larger power plants are under construction in California Florida Illinois and Texas Were building in these seven states because they serve regions where wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support our national power marketing business said Constellation Energy Group Chairman and CEO Christian Poindexter California Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generati ng Plant PGE Corporations National Energy Group NEG last week announced tha t the California Energy Commission CEC has approved construction of the Otay Me sa Generating Plant in San Diego

order mobilizes FERCs entire energy pricing and infrastructure authority To adopt financial incentives for capacity increases in transmission facilities Streamlines regulation of wholesale market energy facilities siting and licensing Promotes conservation and wholesale side of demandresponse bidding Order doesnt address price caps Meeting with Western state regulatorsofficials set for April in Boise Idaho FERC moves to bring more economic and reliable energy supplies to the stressed California and Western energy markets FERC proposes to increase bulk power supply in the West by removing barriers and providing incentives that are within its jurisdiction over facility certification licensing and the regulation of transmission and wholesale power sales in interstate commerce FERC quickly wants to increase electric generation and transmission capacity as well as to streamline the regulation of wholesale power transactions as well as increase the capacity of the supporting infrastructure of natural gas and oil pipelines The order which sets new precedent in its broadness also proposes actions to reduce electricity demand in the West as well as promoting the necessary wholesalemarket portion of demandresponse bidding where states wish to implement the retail side FERC asks for comments on additional actions it may take in the future by March Effective immediately FERC said in a statement the Commission is streamlining regulatory procedures for wholesale electric power sales expediting the certification of natural gas pipeline projects into California and the West including the reallocation of staff resources to more quickly address pending pipeline applications and urging all licensees to review their FERClicensed hydroelectric projects in order to assess the potential for increased generating capacity Among the actions FERC takes are to require the California ISO and transmission owners within all states of the Western Systems Coordinating Council WSCC to prepare a list of grid enhancements that can be completed in the short term waive prior notice requirements for any onsite or selfgenerators that sell at wholesale within the WSCC area grant blanket marketbased rate authority for sales on the wholesale market of electric energy that becomes available as a result of demandresponse reductions in retail and wholesale loads and broadening and extending through December the temporary waivers of the operating and efficiency standards for qualifying facilities QFs to increase the availability of generating capacity FERC seeks comments by March on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring timely upgrades to the western transmission grid including an increased rate of return on equity ROE for projects that significantly increase transmission and can be in service by either June or November Other areas that FERC requested comment on include the use of interconnection authority under the Federal Power Act and to raise the dollar limits on the issuance of blanket certificates authorizing gas pipeline construction On hydro issues FERC requested comment on ways to increase operating flexibility at FERClicensed projects while protecting environmental resources In its effort to encourage investment in transmission infrastructure FERC asked for comments again by March on a series of economic incentives aimed at ensuring upgrades to the Western interconnection including the increased ROE for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained paths and can be in service by the above dates in Increased ROE FERC said will also be given to system upgrades over new transmission paths that can be in service by June or November FERC seeks comment on a proposed year depreciation period for projects that increase transmission capacity in the shortterm and a year depreciation period for upgrades involving new rightsofway that can be of service by November In his dissent to the order Commissioner Massey argued the order focuses on quick fixes and that the measures will not close the gap between supply in demand in California The order also fails to address price relief noted Massey Massey also called for a full Federal Power Act FPA Section investigation of California issues which would allow for the possibility of refunds On transmission incentive provisions Massey lamented that the proposed ROE increase to percent appeared arbitrary and inconsistent with FERC policy under Order No The financial provisions he said appeared to be just throwing money at the problem While generally disappointed with the order Massey did express limited support for many parts of the order Many of the suggestions in the order are the same actions as authorized last May said Massey They were good ideas then and they are good ideas now he concluded For his part in comments at the open meeting when the order was adopted Chairman Hebert said the order was designed to squeeze every additional MW of supply available and to encourage the conservation of MW and stressed that FERC is doing all it can in its power to alleviate Western problems He said the order seeks to eradicate the projected supply shortfall in California but noted that generationtransmission siting and conservation are generally state issues FERCs removing obstacles order is posted on its web site at electricbulkpowerELpdf Citation FERC issued is order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western United States and asking for comments was issued on March Docket No EL A detailed analysis and summary of the specific actions taken and proposals made follows Electric Transmission Infrastructure Within days the California ISO and transmission owners in WSCC are to prepare and file for information purposes a list of grid enhancement projects that may be underway or may not require initial siting and acquisition of rights of way FERC proposes a scaled transmission infrastructure incentive under which transmission owners of projects that increase transmission capacity at present constraints and can be in service by July would receive a costbased rate reflecting a basis point premium return on equity and a year depreciable life Projects in service by November would get a basis point premium and year depreciable life FERC would use a uniform baseline return on equity for all jurisdictional transmission providers in WSCC of based on the ROE FERC approved for Southern California Edison System upgrades that involve new rights of way add significant transfer capability and can be in service by November would get a costbased rate reflecting ROE or a basis point premium and year depreciable life Facilities needed to interconnect new supply to the grid which go into service as required to accommodate the inservice date of the new plant would get a costbased rate that reflected a ROE or a basis point premium if in service by November and ROE if in service by November For increases in transmission capacity on constrained interfaces that do not involve significant capital investments for example installing new technology FERC proposes to allow transmission owners to increase the revenue requirement of their network service rates to ensure that each additional MW of capacity will generate revenues equal to their current firm pointtopoint rate FERC requests comment on whether to assign the cost of any interconnection or system upgrade to a particular load or supply or alternatively to roll these costs into the average system rate Extension of Waivers for QFs FERC proposes to extend its temporary waivers of operating and efficiency standards for QFs applicable throughout WSCC to allow increased generation through December The waivers were to expire on April The proposed waiver would allow qualifying cogenerators to sell their output above the level at which they have historically supplied this output to purchasing utility The waiver for qualifying small power production facilities in WSCC with respect to their fuel use requirements under FERC regulation section b would be extended to December Additional Capacity From OnSite Generation FERC will adopt streamlined regulatory procedure to accommodate wholesale sales from such facilities that serve load within WSCC Through December owners of generating facilities located at business locations in WSCC and used primarily for backup or self generation who would become subject to FPA by virtue of sales of such power will be permitted to sell power at wholesale without prior notice under FPA section FERC also authorizes such power to be sold at marketbased rates FERC waives its prior notice requirement for mutually agreed upon interconnection agreements for interconnections necessary to accomplish these sales Quarterly reporting is required Allows Demand Response Bidding FERC will allow retail customers as permitted by state law and wholesale customers to reduce consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale FERC is granting blanket authorization consistent with its prior discussion on sales from onsite generation and requires similar reporting FERCs December order on the California market directed as a longerterm measure that the ISO pursue establishing an integrated dayahead market in which all demand and supply bids are addressed in one venue FERC seeks comments on the desirability of accelerating action on this FERC says it realizes that states play an important role in regulating retail electric service and that allowing retail load to reduce consumption for resale in wholesale markets raises legal commercial technical and regulatory issues Safeguards may be needed to protect and enhance retail demandresponse bidding programs Intention is not to undermine state programs but to promote the necessary complementary wholesale programs Requests comments on how helpful this action is and how it can be accomplished consistent with state jurisdiction over retail sales Contract Modifications for DemandResponse Bidding There may be opportunities for public utilities to make other types of demandresponse arrangements with their wholesale customers As for mutually agreeable QF interconnections FERC will waive prior notice requirement for any mutually agreeable demandresponse related rate schedule amendments that may be required to effectuate these arrangements Clarifies that demandresponse program costs should be treated consistently with all other types of incremental and outofpocket costs Interconnections FPA section d allows FERC to issue an order requiring interconnection if it makes a finding that such an order is in the public interest would encourage overall conservation of energy or capital optimize the efficiency of use of facilities and resources or improve the reliability of any electric utility system or federal power marketing agency to which the order applies and meets the requirements of FPA section FERC requests comments on whether it can use this authority under FPA section d to alleviate existing impediments to electricity reaching load If the exercise of this authority may be warranted FERC seeks comments on whether it could make some of the required findings generically for the WSCC region in order to respond quickly should circumstances arise requiring immediate action Longer Term Regional Solutions FERC believes an RTO for the entire western region or the seamless integration of Western RTOs is the best vehicle for designing and implementing a longterm regional solution Natural Gas Pipeline Capacity FERC has realigned its resources to respond to new applications for gas pipeline capacity and is soliciting comments on ways to expedite the approval of pipeline infrastructure needed to serve California and the West Requests comments on how it might further exercise its authority over new pipeline construction to alleviate the present crisis including increasing the dollar limit thresholds for blanket certificates to million and for prior notice authorizations to million in order to increase the facilities qualifying for automatic authorization offering blanket certificates for construction or acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to California and offering rate incentives to expedite construction of projects that will make additional capacity available this summer on constrained pipeline systems Hydroelectric Power FERC staff will hold a conference to discuss methods to address environmental protection at hydro projects while allowing increased generation Requests comments on ways to allow for greater operating flexibility at Commissionlicensed hydro projects while protecting environmental resources Comments should consider methods for agency involvement ways to handle and expedite Endangered Species Act consultations criteria for modifying licenses and identification of processes that could be implemented to provide efficiency upgrades Oil Pipelines FERC will explore with oil pipelines innovative proposals that could lead to ensuring an adequate flow of petroleum product into the California market Conference with State Commissioners FERC will hold a oneday conference with state commissioners and other state representatives from Western states to discuss price volatility in the West as well as other FERCrelated issues identified by the Governors of Western states By notice issued March this meeting is
