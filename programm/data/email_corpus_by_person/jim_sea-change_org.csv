<20823248.1075862880428.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,jim@sea-change.org,2001-10-23 09:37:53,thought you might be interested in this alliance with AOL TWKen I am emailing in the hopes of having an opportunity to talk if you are int erested in the following possibility AOL Time Warner has given us a gre at opportunity to spotlight the organizations that are providing systemic responses to not just relief efforts so that these organizations ca nnot be left cold by the shadow of the American Red Cross but that they in stead can receive support at this critical time Below is what I sent to AOL TW in response to their invitation for the wor k described below and their great offer to feature us on their site and ww wlibertyunitesorg I wanted to talk with you because AOL TW and I want to know if you can join AOL TW and support this initiative If possible please let me know if we can talk sometime soon Thanks for considering this Jim In the wake of the events of September the generosity of individuals foundations and businesses has never been more evident The response to Sept has begun to shift from a relief effort to efforts that address the systemic changes that are needed for societal conditions to improve Now more than ever social investors will be looking for organizations th at address both the root causes of social problems and create sustainable social change At this time the American Red Cross continues to be delug ed with support but what about the organizations that live in the shadow of the Red Cross The Red Cross and similar organizations are doing outst anding work when they are needed most now other organizations are movin g beyond the immediate relief efforts of feeding clothing housing the vi ctims and are recognizing that there are new or exacerbated problems that have been stirred up by Sept For example there are numerous organizations protecting civil liberties providing counseling preparing communities for future disasters and assi sting displaced workers organizations such as the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights are steppin g up their efforts to combat racial profiling that has begun and is leadin g to the harassment of people who look of Middle Eastern descent organizations are supporting this same constituency when they are the vict ims of hate crimes that have been perpetrated as a backlash to September children are in need of counseling as a result of their personal fears or fears for their parents and family organizations such as Operation USA are recruiting and deploying counsel ors trained in posttraumatic stress to areas where needed efforts are underway to enhance community preparedness for acts of terrori sm in their communities such as evacuation procedures and organizations such as Career Gear are assisting lowincome workers who l ost their jobs as a result of Sept and now need career counseling app ropriate interview clothing and job retention services so they do not fall into the spiral of welfare Please note that each of the organizations mentioned above are SeaChange members These are just a few examples among many efforts that have commenced to re spond to the call for change and not just service Life will never be the same These organizations are working to see that it will in fact be bet ter But unfortunately they are not known by most philanthropists foun dations or businesses In fact we have heard from organizations that som e businesses are pulling back from commitments to these smaller organizati ons to associate with the larger organizations providing rescue relief an d recovery services These lesserknown organizations who are doing crit ical social change work need to feel the philanthropic winds in their sai ls too so they can make progress toward much needed change Many funds have been created to earmark money for the Sept response b ut the recipients of a significant portion of those monies have not yet be en identified Companies have for example set aside several million dol lars and have earmarked half or more for the Red Cross but still have not decided what to do with the rest of the funds For these Funds for www helpingorg and wwwlibertyunitesorg and for social investors in our network SeaChange is uniquely positioned to become the source of informat ion of organizations that are moving beyond relief efforts and are focused on the systemic changes necessary for conditions to improve On their be half SeaChange can directly approach the administrators of these Funds an d other social investors to make them aware of these overlooked change org anizations The mission of SeaChange is to connect entrepreneurial nonprofits with res ources for sustainable social change We will do just that by spotlightin g the very organizations that can have an impact not only today but tomor row as well For social investors we will provide them with detailed in formation about a broad menu of screened organizations working to effect s ocial change not only in response to Sept but also in response to the changed environment in which we now live SeaChange also provides these p otential supporters with an easy way to search for organizations that meet their giving specifications Additionally they can be notified of organiz ations that meet their criteria doing all of this anonymously if they c hoose to And as discussed above we will not only do this online but offline as well by advocating to various Fund adminstrators As a resul t SeaChange will effectively and efficiently connect those who are seekin g support at this critical time with those who are looking to give their s upport Jim Pitofsky CEO SeaChange San FranciscoCA
