Arthur Money I would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defenses Highlands Forum The Highlands Forum is a crossdisciplinary group of eminent scholars researchers CEOsCIOsCTOs from industry and leaders from the media the arts and the professions who have met over the past six years to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us The idea is to gain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and working in and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that environment The Forum includes seniors from the White House Defense and other agencies of government we limit government participation to about Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics as The Mind the Brain and Computing The Convergence of Information Technology and Biotechnology and Innovation in Public Sector Organizations Our meeting in May explored MEMS nanotechnology and molecular computing among our participants were Sun Microsystems founder Bill Joy Phil Kuekes of HP Nobel laureate Rick Smalley Our last meeting in September focused on the future of software and participants included Inktomi founder Eric Brewer SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos Packet Design CEO Judy Estrin board member of FedEx and Cisco and Esther Dyson The Forum is an idea enginethere are no reports and no consensus recommendations Meeting size is usually kept to around people to remain small and informal encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a speaker or a panel we call it strategic conversation While there is media participation in our meetings there is no press coverage of the discussions Our distinguised media participants in this meeting CEO UPI Exec Editor International Herald Tribune will take part representing themselves and will act as moderators Several of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell you about the Forum and this particular meeting We are going to hold Highlands Forum in Washington DC on December half day on the th The topic will be built around the search for informationtransformation strategies for the Department of Defense and government in general The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this Highlands to think about the elements of an information strategy and I have suggested that we look at information and strategy from a business perspective transformation productivity competitive advantage We will look at or useful business cases for context ENRON is a remarkable example of transformation in a highly rigid regulated industry that has created a new model and new markets The Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which has information superiority better faster decision making at its core the Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can benefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it to achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds Clearly not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment however many do I am interested in business cases which ideally describe an enterpriselevel information or transformation strategythose which see an information strategy as the overarching strategy or at least as a core component of corporateoperational strategyuse of information technology information protectionassurance CRM and perhaps how to use information and technology to transition or capture or create a new market One operational example that we will look at is Cemex the Mexican cement company that uses IT GPS and communications to swarm its trucks in the ready cement business Their COO will be joining us to describe how they succeeded in dominating their market In addition to Cemex other companies represented in our agenda include Cisco eBay Schwab and Sourceree ENRON is of great interest to us What we learn from you may help the Department of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy I hope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the Highlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group I would be happy to tell you more about
