costs to be as low as possible since this will cause the PX credit t o be lower and thus the positive CTC higher However beginning April they pray for just the opposite the greater their QF costs the more t hey can collect from DA customers to help pay for the QFs I truly hope I have misunderstood you else my brain may explode Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Mon PM To Swain Steve Mara

To Curry Wanda Swain Steve Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ru ffer Mary Lynne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Cc Gorny Vladimir Bradford William S Kingerski Harry Savage Go rdon Tribolet Michael Subject RE Summary or PX Credit Proposals An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August SCE said that it h as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR Once the CPUC decides on the DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generationrelat ed CTC again There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond once QF contracts are above the market SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and rebill begining with Jan it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a onehalf cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of cents ma king it about cents that collects the million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge The half cent addition is for months Original Message From Curry Wanda Sent Friday August AM To Swain Steve Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ruffer Mary Lyn ne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Mara Susan Cc Gorny Vladimir Bradford William S Subject Summary or PX Credit Proposals I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August th Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August th Current Issues The methodology for calculating PX credits after January is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies Applicability of the cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not Impact to Enron if FERC implements retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct thru January th which result in revised PX credits Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the gross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationc ommodity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent will be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an all owable claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p ossible PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent level Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits if when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC Other consideration Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts PGE Recommended Approach This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu ary would include an avoided cost component This avoided cost component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDW R purchases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchase s This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX cle aring price in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDW R purchase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embe dded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would h amper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail port folio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from Jan uary through September and that the SCE approach is applicable from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa l Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP a nd SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe r PGE and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low Howev er understanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti es and CPUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk b ut this is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated wit h the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda Curry

questions are PX Credit Make it simple and transparent Best outcome would be no credit DA pays TD costs only as they appear in the tariff Period end of story The UDC Financial Hole The more relief we can get from these items the better Duh The small surcharge is currently factored into in our curves so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is If our contract language ends up protecting us further all the better but I would prefer that not to be our last resort Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Tuesday October PM To Swain Steve Tribolet Michael Dasovich Jeff Subject Enrons Advocacy in California Steve As you can see from the email chain we are now at a decision point on where we want to go with PGE and SCE With the progress of the PGE bankruptcy and the SCE Settlement with the CPUC it is important that we are all on the same page Basically we need to make sure that our advocacy is consistent with our expected outcomes at the CPUC and with the nature of your business both current and hopefully going forward Do you have a preferred outcome on the PX Credit mechanism Our advocacy on allocation of Utility Undercollection CDWR longterm contracts and Bonds to pay off CDWR current costs is that if a customer never was on DA they should be free of all of these costs Following from that logic we want to argue that customers who cause these buckets of costs for limited periods of time should only pay for those periods We need to discuss the probable outcome of the assignment of these costs and Bob Williams ideas on the tax passthru I have attached Mike Smiths matrix on the outcome for each bucket of Lets talk very soon We are potentially moving forward with a SCE strategy

as tax The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response Its their So far my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations as outlined in the Mike Smith memo are the preferred outcome Ill reconfirm Jim Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject RE surcharge as tax We could not do that On the other hand if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted and the CPUC adopts that reasoning we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot I think you are right that we need to understand the implications both financially and contractually of the options before the Commission Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Williams Robert C Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject RE surcharge as tax Thanks One other question which seems like a legal question Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers including ours understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges If the PUC does it and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it Im hoping that the answer is no Thanks for the info Best Jeff Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject FW surcharge as tax a legal memo follows Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Thursday August AM To Mellencamp Lisa Subject FW surcharge as tax Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Friday July PM To Sharp Vicki Subject surcharge as tax A typical clause reads as follows Taxes means any and all new or existing governmental or quasigovernmental taxes assessments levies duties fees charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described including gross receipts franchise sales use property excise capital stamp transfer employment occupation generatiion privilege Utility Taxes separately defined to include any and all franchise utility regulatory BTU or energy gross receipts administrative services municipality and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges regulatory BTU energy consumption lease transaction license filing recording and activity taxes levies duties fees charges and withholdings together with any and all penalties fines interest and additions thereto but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point the meter the Seller is usually responsible for taxes applicable prior to the Delivery Point The surcharge would seem to be applicable at the Delivery Point Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a tax under the contracts The CPUC refers to it as a rate increase It was not imposed by a governmental body such as a state county or municipality When first implemented all proceeds went to the utilities It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities Support for the argument that the surcharge is a tax under the contracts Since the frozen tariff remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a rate increase It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity the DWR The definition of taxes under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types To the extent the surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers those on direct access receive if anything only an indirect benefit which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

<1777135.1075861594375.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.swain@enron.com,2001-10-31 13:57:35,RE Sues Retort to SCEs PremiseSue is right of course But Her argument turns in part on her assumption that going into the deal back in the utilities were agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices Like most parties back then they never contemplated a world where energy prices would exceed their capped average rate of In other words they assumed they would recoup most if not all of their stranded costs They may have even assumed certainly they seem to be arguing for it now that they DESERVED to recoup their stranded costs and that AB was designed to guarantee it I do not know all of the details of the history but yall have spoken of a ruling PUC Court to address the specific issue of negative CTC zero minimum bill etc Obviously this ruling was in our favor which lends a lot of credibility to Sues argument But the fact that the original dereg plan was so vague as to require a ruling on this issue ex post opens the door to a counterargument by the utilities namely that at the time of AB s passage they were not explicitly agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices they were instead forced to do so by later interpretations of the law If they had known then Please note that I do remember what side I am on I am not saying that this counterargument is correct Indeed the negative CTC ruling is de facto evidence that they are wrong even if they didnt know it going into the deal I only present all of this bc I think it is the only halfway sensible argument they can make in the face of Sues impeccable logic and I think we ought to at least have given it some thought in case they try to bring it up Original Message From Mara Susan Sent Wednesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Swain Steve Curry Wanda Subject Sues Retort to SCEs Premise Importance High I dont agree Edisons premise that direct access customers contributed just as much to SCEs procurement costs undercollection as bundled service customers We need to make clear that we dont buy in to their rhetoric Heres my reasoning DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers SCE had to buy power to serve the bundled load SCE did not buy power for DA customers SCEs purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the undercollection I can make the argument that the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE There are two big reasons that back me up AB and Topdown rates I will explain The utilities got what they wanted out of AB payments of plus billion in socalled stranded costs and a real delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off One of the tradeoffs however was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their billions by the deadline Thats the risk they agreed to Now they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more This is in direct conflict with the statute I can make the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs alone now the CPUC can bail them out but that doesnt make ESPs subject to any presumed undercollection Now to the rates At the beginning of DA the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from TD So they did a topdown calculation This meant that there had to be a credit put on the bills of DA customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA So the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the rates Next although bundled customers rates were capped the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for DA customers their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their ESPs However when the utilities filed their tariffs with the CPUC they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor authorized by the Commission Enron attacked it but got nowhere until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the RAP Proceeding Our argument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities avoided by not serving DA customers We argued that anything less is fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive The utilities must have thought we had a good case because they agreed to settle The settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding Everyone understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high So we have a legal right to receive the full PX CreditNegative CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated with bundled customers It seems as if we should be able to prosecute this legal right keeping in mind I am not an attorney In summary we have leverage and should use it Sue Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday October AM To Mara Susan Steffes James D Mellencamp Lisa

answers to your questions are PX Credit Make it simple and transparent Best outcome would be no credit DA pays TD costs only as they appear in the tariff Period end of story The UDC Financial Hole The more relief we can get from these items the better Duh The small surcharge is currently factored into in our curves so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is If our contract language ends up protecting us further all the better but I would prefer that not to be our last resort Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Tuesday October PM To Swain Steve Tribolet Michael Dasovich Jeff Subject Enrons Advocacy in California Steve As you can see from the email chain we are now at a decision point on where we want to go with PGE and SCE With the progress of the PGE bankruptcy and the SCE Settlement with the CPUC it is important that we are all on the same page Basically we need to make sure that our advocacy is consistent with our expected outcomes at the CPUC and with the nature of your business both current and hopefully going forward Do you have a preferred outcome on the PX Credit mechanism Our advocacy on allocation of Utility Undercollection CDWR longterm contracts and Bonds to pay off CDWR current costs is that if a customer never was on DA they should be free of all of these costs Following from that logic we want to argue that customers who cause these buckets of costs for limited periods of time should only pay for those periods We need to discuss the probable outcome of the assignment of these costs and Bob Williams ideas on the tax passthru I have attached Mike Smiths matrix on the outcome for each bucket of Lets talk very soon We are potentially moving forward with a SCE strategy Jim File CA Surcharge Matrix doc Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Tuesday October PM To Williams Robert C Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Wu Andrew Smith Mike Sanders Richard B Subject RE surcharge as tax The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response Its their So far my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations as outlined in the Mike Smith memo are the preferred outcome Ill reconfirm Jim Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject RE surcharge as tax We could not do that On the other hand if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted and the CPUC adopts that reasoning we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot I think you are right that we need to understand the implications both financially and contractually of the options before the Commission Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Tuesday October PM To Williams Robert C Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject RE surcharge as tax Thanks One other question which seems like a legal question Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers including ours understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges If the PUC does it and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it Im hoping that the answer is no Thanks for the info Best Jeff Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Tuesday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Steffes James D Wu Andrew Smith Mike Subject FW surcharge as tax a legal memo follows Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Thursday August AM To Mellencamp Lisa Subject FW surcharge as tax Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Friday July PM To Sharp Vicki Subject surcharge as tax A typical clause reads as follows Taxes means any and all new or existing governmental or quasigovernmental taxes assessments levies duties fees charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described including gross receipts franchise sales use property excise capital stamp transfer employment occupation generatiion privilege Utility Taxes separately defined to include any and all franchise utility regulatory BTU or energy gross receipts administrative services municipality and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges regulatory BTU energy consumption lease transaction license filing recording and activity taxes levies duties fees charges and withholdings together with any and all penalties fines interest and additions thereto but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point the meter the Seller is usually responsible for taxes applicable prior to the Delivery Point The surcharge would seem to be applicable at the Delivery Point Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a tax under the contracts The CPUC refers to it as a rate increase It was not imposed by a governmental body such as a state county or municipality When first implemented all proceeds went to the utilities It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities Support for the argument that the surcharge is a tax under the contracts Since the frozen tariff remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a rate increase It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity the DWR The definition of taxes under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types To the extent the surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers those on direct access receive if anything only an indirect benefit which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase
<32580060.1075851656873.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,steve.swain@enron.com,2001-10-12 11:19:26,RE CA questionNonPrivilegedpst Before we carry this much further let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now unless you include DWR costs which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC AA was wondering why we werent holding some reserves for this eventuality Mary Lynne and I told them we werent reserving bc we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months reCTC but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess bc no one can agree on what PX credit market price is now that there is no PX Besides though SCE and PGE are arguing for different methods the socalled topdown and bottomup in the end the result will be about the same CTC especially now that PGE has supposedly stopped adjusting the PX credit to recover past undercollections And of course the DWR contracts muddy the waters since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation Bottom line we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run In light of all this we thought we might further quell AAs skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit we were now simply arguing that DA should pay TD only and that CTC should become a relic of the past I think by now it may be a dead issue I believe AA has accepted our arguments wo this extra bit of persuasion else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne Thanks for all the background and input from everyone and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Friday October AM To Mara Susan Steffes James D Swain Steve Subject RE CA question Recognizing that it was Sues idea though Im not sure Sue if youre referring to the DJ index or the bottomsup approach isnt it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method and didnt ARM more recently submit some bottomsup testimony comments etc Best Jeff Original Message From Mara Susan Sent Friday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Swain Steve Subject RE CA question All I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a RAP case three years ago The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted Therefore we dont have to worry about it If we like the idea we would have to find a way to propose it anew if we dont like the idea we just fail to bring it up again Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Thursday October AM To Steffes James D Swain Steve Mara Susan Subject RE CA question We did recommend using the DJ index But subsequent to that I believe we filed as part of the ARM coalition recommending a bottomsup approach Is that right Sue However I dont think its accurate to say that we withdrew the DJ index recommendation Both our original DJ recommendation and the bottoms up recommendation are still sitting at the PUC I think thats how things currently stand Best Jeff Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Thursday October AM To Dasovich Jeff Subject FW CA question FYI Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Thursday October AM To Mara Susan Swain Steve Subject FW CA question Steve We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument however Ive include Sue Mara on this to double check If we havent Id guess that is no longer URMs position Jim Original Message From Swain Steve Sent Wednesday October PM To Steffes James D Subject CA question I spoke with Mary Lynne today and she said that once upon a time after the PX expired we filed something asking the CPUC to make the DJ index a substitute for the PX credit Does this ring a bell And the more important question did we ever withdraw that request Thanks
