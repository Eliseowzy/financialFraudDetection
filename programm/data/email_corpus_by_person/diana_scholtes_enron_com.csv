Subject Federal price limits backfire wwwsfgatecom Return to regular view Federal price limits backfire Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday July San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL Officials in California and Nevada after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon and one day after the firstever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energyhungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the socalled price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages We need some clarity to this order said Oscar Hidalgo a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources which is spending billions of dollars to keep the states lights on Generators need to be held accountable he said The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at belowmarket rates during periods of high demand Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost No ones going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps said Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association in Menlo Park Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough Ackerman said It increases the threat of blackouts BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED California authorities issued a blackout alert at pm yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels They canceled the alert about an hour later after finding additional supplies Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts said Stephanie McCorkle a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator which oversees the states power network The Golden States latest brush with lightsout conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights Don Soderberg chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Mondays shortage Were looking very closely at this he said There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences Specifically Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older less efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking if not vanishing under capped prices Were going to see how the caps might have played into this he said The federal ceiling in Western states excluding California is about per megawatt hour In California a percent surcharge is added because of the states credit risk bringing the price to just over Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended Californias power crisis to neighboring states California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus he said LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES California and Nevada officials however said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes in the plan said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources Unfortunately it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance For months federal regulators refused to impose price controls preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies No one answered he said They were closed State officials tried again yesterday and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response Email David Lazarus at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

Paid Good work if you can find it Wednesday July Energy Novice to Be Paid Power Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one years experience in the field State officials say she is doing a good job By JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY Times Staff Writers The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a years experience in the energy industry annually to head a team of traders who secure Californias daily electricity supply State officials hired Susan T Lee in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov Gray Davis Lees contract is equal to the a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor S David Freeman a top utility executive for decades The twoyear contract will pay Lee up to to oversee the states daytoday energy purchases totaling billions of dollars a year Lees contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nations largest power buyers a role that it took on in January as Californias utilities faltered Lees contract was one of about a dozen released Monday and among the largest Reached at her Sacramento office Lee would not discuss her contract She said only that she heads a person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep Californias power flowing Pete Garris a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu her boss at Mieco Inc a trading firm in Long Beach recommended her Shimizu refused comment Tuesday The state according to Garris must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary Garris said Unless we can get permanent and fulltime positions approved these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire consultants Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lees contract with the sixmonth deal that Freemanthe former boss at several major utilitiesstruck with the governor I dont want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman Garris said David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a private power marketer With Susan we just followed the standard formula In her new job Lee will direct an immensely complicated aroundtheclock operation responsible for procuring energy scheduling power and associated transmission and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries according to her contract Lees resume attached to the contract shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March when she joined Mieco There she was a trader and power scheduler not a manager She was only here for a year or so said Dina Alvarez an administrative manager for the company A graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco Lees contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field She is being paid an hour and can earn a maximum of including expenses by April Another new consultant William L Green has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration Pacific Gas Electric and the California Independent System Operator He is being paid an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the states accounting of energy purchases His twoyear deal is worth up to They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals Richard Ferreira the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District has a contract and is being paid an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts He worked for the Department of Water Resources for years before joining the Sacramento agency in Hardy Energy Consulting also has a sixmonth contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid an hour Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration where he was chief executive officer from to Lees recruiter Garris said her lack of experience is not a concern So far shes done an excellent job he said She has the skills and she has the ability She was doing a similar job Dozens of consultants including Lee have been hired since January when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric because they were no longer considered creditworthy said Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the Department of Water Resources Hidalgo said that about of the people now working for the division are consultants The rest are state employees As part of the process Lees unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months Copyright Los Angeles Times
