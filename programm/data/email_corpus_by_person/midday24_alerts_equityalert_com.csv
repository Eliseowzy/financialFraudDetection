TI announced thirdquarter financial r esults that show the companys thirdquarter revenue was million dow n percent from the second quarter and slightly better than the companys outlook issued in July for a decline of to percent Orders which had fallen percent sequentially in the second quarter declined percent s equentially in the third quarter to million Semiconductor orders wer e about even with the secondquarter level TIs overall booktobill for semiconductors continued to rise sequentially and TIs DSP booktobill e xceeded one for the second consecutive quarter DSP revenue was up perce nt

and down percent sequentially due to weakness in Semiconductor Cost of revenues in the third quarter was million compared with mil lion in the yearago quarter Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to d ecreased Semiconductor revenue Research and development RD totaled million down from million in the third quarter of primarily due to acquisition related charges for inprocess Rin the third quarter of Selling general and administrative expense in the quarter was million down from million in the yearago quarter due to saving s resulting from restructuring activities and tight spending

in the fourth quarter Fourthquarter TI rev enue is expected to decline about percent sequentially mostly due to no rmal seasonal declines in Educational Productivity Solutions EPS as we ll as continued weakness in Semiconductor Specifically TI expects the f ollowing for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter In Semic onductor revenue will decline about percent as continued growth in DSP i s more than offset by declines in other products Sensors Controls re venue will be about even EPS revenue will decline by about milli on or percent as the backtoschool season for educational products en ds Operating margin will decline about percentage points before the effect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisitio nrelated intangibles reflecting the lower revenue level and further reduc tions in inventory Nonoperating income will decline about million reflecting lower interest rates Loss per share will be about cents more in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter before the eff ect of special charges and amortization of goodwill and other acquisitionr elated intangibles For TI expects the following Rof bil lion excluding acquisitionrelated amortization and purchased inprocess R D compared with the companys prior estimate of billion and last yea rs billion Capital expenditures of billion unchanged from the prior estimate and down about percent from last year Depreciati on of billion compared with the prior estimate of billion and up about percent from last year SEMICONDUCTOR Semiconductor revenue in the third quarter was million down from million in the yeara go period Revenue was down from million in the second quarter due to continued weakness across most Semiconductor products excluding DSP As a result of lower revenue Semiconductor had a million operating loss compared with an operating profit of million in the yearago period and an operating loss of million in the second quarter Analog revenu e was down percent from the yearago period and percent sequentially due to broad based weakness in demand In the first nine months of the year about percent of total Semiconductor revenue came from

follows from Eq uityAlertcom New TI Chipset Leverages OMAPTM GSMGPRS Systemon aChip for NextGeneration Wireless Data and VoiceDTI Delivers Industry s Most Complete Smart Phone Chipset Reference Design DALLAS Oct PRNewswire via COMTEX The broad market availability of G mobile sm art phones and personal digital assistants PDAs will receive a significan t boost today thanks to a new highlyintegrated chipset offering from Texa s Instruments Incorporated NYSE TXN TI that delivers voice and enhance d data The new chipset provides wireless device manufacturers with a compl ete antennatoapplications solution and reference design for enabling op timal performance and power savings for G mobile devices TIs OMAPTM platform technology lies at the heart of the chipset and is the first proce ssor to integrate a GSMGPRS modem and a dedicated applications processor o n a single chip that supports nextgeneration bandwidthintensive wireless applications See scTCS The programmable digit al signal processor DSPbased TCS chipset leverages the OMAP proce ssor to enable services such as multimedia messaging short video clip and Internet audio downloads email realtime Web browsing and games Buildin g on the benefits of TIs TCS GPRS chipset announced in June the new TCS chipset combines the OMAP processor with TIs leading analog baseband and RF technology to offer a comprehensive silicon and software o ffering Tailored specifically for G smart phone and PDA devices the TC S chipset adds to TIs growing family of GPRS solutions The TCS chipset is an integral part of TIs strategy to provide powerfully integra ted solutions that speed timetomarket for our OEM customers said JeanL uc Villevieille general manager of TIs wireless chipset solutions With the TCS offerings wireless designers will benefit from TIs years o f wireless expertise plus our OMAP platform which has already been selecte d by a wide variety of manufacturers as the de facto standard for and G devices TI Chipsets Provide Significant Advantages for Wireless Indus try Wireless device manufacturers can significantly reduce cost and form factors over current smart phones and PDA implementations due to the integr ation in the TCS chipset At the same time the chipset allows new syst ems to maintain low power and performance comparable to todays voice cent ric G wireless phones Also important for wireless device manufacturers T Is TCS solutions includes the key building blocks for quickly and easi ly developing G devices a GSMGPRS digital baseband processor which in cludes dedicated applications functionality analog baseband and RF compani on chips plus complete software solutions including protocol stacks At the core of the solution is TIs OMAP processor that incorporates a DSP based GSMGPRS digital baseband engine and an ARM microprocessor with inte grated MMU and cache for complete modem and applications support As part o f TIs OMAP family of flexible open processors the OMAP features full support of advanced mobile operating systems such as Microsofts Windows CE PalmOS Symbian OS and LinuxR In addition the OMAP provides Java p rogramming support and gives wireless device manufacturers access to a netw ork of application developers who are actively creating applications for th e OMAP platform The OMAP processor is code compatible with TIs OMAP processor and other future OMAP wireless products This allows designer s building products on one processor to quickly and easily port code to ano ther saving significant engineering resources for manufacturers Other d evices in the TCS chipset include the TWL analog baseband and the T RF RF IC The TWL combines voiceband and baseband codecs with singl e and multislot IQ RF interfaces and auxiliary RF converters into a highl y integrated device The TRF is a highly integrated RF IC based on an a dvanced direct conversion architecture yielding bill of materials BOM re ductions of about percent versus competitive super heterodyne architectu res Complete G Wireless Smart Phone Reference Design Reduces Time to Market The TCS chipset includes a full array of software development tools as well as a complete OMAPbased reference design that together ca n reduce development time by more than half a year The reference design in cludes the complete BOM board design and layout a fully typeapproved ref erence design bestinclass and worldwide customer support and access to a complete GSMGPRS Layer and stack The reference design is a comple te G wireless system solution that is ready to be manufactured and put i nto final plastics The TCS chipset is sampling to customers today an d will begin shipping before the end of Texas Instruments Incorpora ted is the world leader in digital signal processing and analog
