their commitment to providing safe affordable housing while standing firm against homeless camping in the City of Portland Mayor Vera Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten held a news conference today to announce their holistic approach to address homeless and housing issues The two focused on the Citys ongoing efforts to preserve and create more affordable housing the current tools available to continue enforcing anticamping laws and announced an expanded partnership with JOIN a private organization that does outreach to homeless people While I am still a firm believer in the need for the anticamping ordinance to prevent unsafe and unsanitary campgrounds this has given us the opportunity to take a closer look at what we in the City are doing to provide housing and shelter opportunities for everyone said Katz and while weve made strides meeting our affordable housing commitments there is still more we can do Katz and Commissioner Erik Sten announced their intent to follow the recommendation of Stens Housing Resources Task Force to spend million of the million allocated for affordable housing this coming year on housing for those in the percent median income range Over the last seven years the City of Portland has committed nearly million towards affordable housing in addition to foregoing million in revenue through tax abatements Homelessness is an issue that should be addressed by first dealing with the individual at a personal level said Commissioner Sten I appreciate that the City is continuing to move forward on doing this with aggressive efforts around things such as housing and outreach services Katz and Sten also noted recent successes in meeting affordable housing needs including the Portland Development Commissions justcompleted purchase of the Fountain Place apartment building and the recent opening of Ritzdorf Court which completed the Shelter Reconfiguration Plan The Fountain Place acquisition completed just last Friday means the city will save the buildings affordable housing rates and serve as potential replacement housing for nearby lowincome units soon to be lost Additionally Katz and Sten also announced an expanded partnership with JOIN an outreach group that works to connect the homeless with services The Bureau of Housing and Community Development plans to increase JOINs current contract with the bureau to a total of This money combined with a new contribution from the Portland Police Bureau will increase the number of JOIN outreach workers enabling them to work in every precinct to link homeless people with housing assistance resources It is critical that we find ways for all of us to work together to help homeless people find their way off the streets that means our outreach workers police ODOT and neighbors all collaborating to make that happen said Rob Justus Executive Director JOIN Our ultimate goal is to respond to homelessness and address the negative effect of hundreds on the streets by helping people into housing By engaging the homeless people where they are whether its under a bridge or in an alleyway our outreach workers can help them begin that transition off the streets At the same time Katz and Sten said that the Citys aggressive efforts to preserve and create affordable housing opportunities and to link homeless individuals to those opportunities made it all the more reasonable to continue to enforce the Citys anticamping policy which prevents unsafe and unhealthy campsites from degrading neighborhood livability Both said they are pleased the Multnomah County District Attorney has decided to appeal Judge Stephen Gallaghers opinion that the Citys Homeless Camping Ordinance is unconstitutional While the City Attorneys Office and DAs Office continue to analyze the implications of the Gallagher opinion Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief Bruce Prunk outlined alternative tools the City intends to use to continue its efforts to restrict homeless camping in public areas Parks City Code closes most City parks between midnight and am others such as Forest Park close earlier After closure people camping would be subject to state law prohibition on criminal trespass in the second degree and police could issue citations andor remove people for trespassing The City also has the ability to exclude people from City parks for a period of not more than days Permanent or temporary structures or facilities are also prohibited by City Code at all times so police could issue citations or remove people violating the ordinance as an unclassified misdemeanor Highway Overpasses Oregon Department of Transportation property under I and I overpasses are posted with No Trespassing signs which means police could issue citations to anyone camping at those locations Sidewalks There are provisions of the City Code that prohibit sidewalk obstructions Parking City Code prohibits parking a recreational vehicle in the public right of way directly across from a residential public park church or school property unless the vehicle is being loaded and unloaded for a period not to exceed eight hours In addition no vehicle may park on the public right of way or other public property in excess of hours without City permission If so the vehicle may be removed Prunk said the Police Bureau would continue to work with the partners currently in place such as JOIN noting that recent efforts have focused less on anticamping citations and more on trespassing violations To read Mayor Katzs comments from the news conference go to
