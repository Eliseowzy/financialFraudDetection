we like it or not history is littered with fallen empires and nati ons who have persecuted the Jews Israel unlike us at least until now u nderstands that it is in a war a war for its very survival a war against those who openly state that they do not consider Israel to have the right to even exist But we know from the Bible that Israel will always exist an d those who help the Jews God will bless and those who hate the Jews God will punish And even though we dont always agree with what Israel does they are our friends they know how to fight and they are our allies in th is War Israel knows they are in a fight for their very existence The same enemy of the Jews hates America They hate America and the West for the very rea sons outlined in the article below They are and have been openly at war w ith us for years Every American better understand that now And if we don t have the best intelligence service and the best armed forces in the worl d we are going to continue to pay dearly Several years before World War T wo MacArthur while Chief of Staff of the Army stated that there was noth ing more expensive than a cheap army We can expand that today to include all aspects of national security to include an intelligence apparatus neces sary to penetrate enemy organizations The additional challenge we face is in curbing the never ending desire for bigger and stronger government at t he expense of freedom Can we as a people vote in statesmen rather than po liticians to fill the ranks of government But above and beyond all of this is the fact that the Christian those who believe in Jesus Christ faith alone in Christ alone for salvation mu st understand that Jesus Christ does control history and no matter what hap pens on the historical scene He will take care of us both in life and in de ath With that said we need to make sure that as many of these terroris ts as possible meet allah very soon Original Message From mailto To mailto m mailto mailto

time An interesting debate by folks that know far more that I about middle east stuff M Petit and Charlie are both former analysts with one of our secur ity organizations and offer interesting insights If you are in the mood worth a read start on the bottom articleDLS Comments by M Petit In response to several articles and comments I have received Regarding the original article I disagree with one of the points Jews w ere originally treated decently for a while within Islam As was women un til the Arabs encountered the tradition of purdah in India Mohammed incorp orated the Jewish prophets and have Jesus as one of his prophets As to comments that our relationship with Israel is the basis of this confl ict I disagree There is a perceived cultural divide on the part of the fanatical Muslims The West is more representative of the devils evil way s We are to them to the pagans that Christian missionaries sought to conv ert However conversion to Islam is usually done under the sword And it goes deeper We have defeated the Islamic forces when we have engaged the m And the Israelis have also done so The defeats have been so thorough as to be humiliating Israel must perceive itself as being independent Politically their leader never could accept direct orders from another state But note one of th e first countries to offer sympathy and support was Israel Note one thing Arabs started the slave trade Swahili is the language of the Arab slave traders with their African business partners African Musl ims were buried in a separate section in a Muslim cemetery Farrakan and h is followers wake up Pakistan has declared it would support the US with permitting overhead flig hts The Afghanis are flooding out of their country The Afghan leaders a re announcing that they are safe dont worry The bottom line is that eve n the Afghanis under the Taliban know who will win We have won the first skirmish in the War Against Terrorists MPetit ubject Re Article on the Cause of the Attack Interesting historical presentation good food for thought I also refer you to page A of the September Washington Post Bush requests Shaon get on with talks with Arafat Sharon says shove it up your nose is this a positive thinking member of the western world We s end B a year to Israel to protect them as a nation and assist in keeping them in the modern world It never hurts to talk to your adversaries even if you talk while fighting The current disaster poses an opportunity for both friends and allies to understand US power Thoughts imagespagederbyshireprintgif Hesperophobia On blaming the Jews Mr Derbyshire is also an NR contributing editor September pm Back in there were some horrible massacres at two Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon Christian Lebanese Arabs actually did the killing but th e Israeli army was in the neighborhood and was responsible at some theore tical level for keeping the peace in the zone that included the camps Bec ause of this the Israelis took much of the brunt of the worlds outrage at the killings Commenting on these events the Israeli Prime Minister Mena chem Begin remarked in disgust Goyim kill goyim and they blame the Jews Ive been getting the same feeling from some of my email The fundamental reason America is under attack by Arab terrorists several dozen people wan t me to know is that the US supports Israel And the only reason we do t hat several of them have said or hinted is because of the political powe r of the Jewish lobby here in the USA A few of my correspondents have ex pressed themselves more bluntly than that Put it this way While I hav e not yet encountered the word bloodsuckers perhaps my readership isnt diverse enough some of this stuff comes pretty close though I should say in fairness most is argued on cold nationalinterest grounds At any r ate a lot of people feel that the mass killing of Americans by Arab terror ists is all the fault of Israel and those American politicians who for low and disreputable motives or from sheer blindness to Americas true ideals and interests support her Goyim kill goyim and they blame the Jews Setting aside the statistical certainty that some of the dead Americans are Jewish as in high statistical probability some were of Arab origins a nd at the risk of yet more illtempered or abusive emails I am going to d eclare that I dont think these recent outrages can be blamed on the Jews nor even on proIsrael American politicians The root phenomenon is not Ame rican involvement in Middle Eastern affairs The root phenomenon is hespero phobia This word was coined by the political scientist Robert Conquest Its roots are the Greek words hesperos which means the west and phobos which mean s fear but which when used as an English suffix can also carry the meani ng hate Hesperophobia is fear or hatred of the West While Im in the c lassical stuff by the way I committed a breach of good manners in my last posting by inserting a Latin tag without translation I am sorry Oderint dum metuant means Let them hate us so long as they fear us Seneca rebuk ed Cicero for saying it though it seems to have been current among educate d laterepublican Romans Here is the news A lot of people out there hate us The name Durban mean anything In China in India in Pakistan in Indonesia and Malaysia in A frica and in the Arab countries European civilization the West is wid ely hated Matter of fact quite a lot of Europeans and Americans hate it too as you will know if you spend much time on college campuses I cant see any strong reason for believing that if the state of Israel wer e to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow hesperophobia would dis appear with it Not even just Arab hesperophobia would decline A common wo rd for Europeans in the Arabic language is feringji from Frank ie cru sader Arabs dont hate us because we support Israel They hate us because we humiliated them showed up the gross inferiority of their culture To th em and similarly humiliated peoples we are the other detested and feared in a way we can barely understand Things got really bad in the th centu ry When European society achieved industrial liftoff Europeans were sudd enly buzzing all over the world like a swarm of bees They encountered thes e other cultures that had been vegetating in a quiet conviction of their o wn superiority for centuries or in the case of the Chinese millennia Wh en these encounters occurred the encountered culture collapsed in a cloud of dust Some of them like the Turks managed to reconstitute themselves a s more or less modern nations others like the Arabs and the Chinese are still struggling with the trauma of that encounter Neither the Arabs nor t he Chinese for example have yet been able to attain rational constitutio nal government For a devastating look at the paleolithic condition of poli tics and society in the Arab world I strongly recommend my colleague David PryceJoness book The Closed Circle execobidosA SINqidDsrDrefDscb nationalreviewon The Gulf War showed how little has changed since those first encounter s Here were the armies of the West swift deadly efficient equipped and organized under the command of elected civilians at the head of a robust and elaborate constitutional structure And here were the Arabs a shamblin g illnourished shoeless rabble led by a mad gangsterdespot That was their Arabs There were also of course our Arabs the Kuwaitis and Saudi s cowering in their plushlined airconditioned bunkers being waited on by their Filipino servants while we did their fighting for them Final body counts the West dead the Arabs or more The superiority of o ne culture over another has not been so starkly demonstrated since a handfu l of British wooden ships at the end of tenthousandmile lines of communi cations brought the Celestial Empire to its knees years earlier The C hinese are still mad about that They are still making angry bitter movies about the Opium Wars A hundred and years from now the Arabs will not have forgotten the Gulf War If you havent spent some time in its company the depth and bitterness of hesperophobia in these cultures is hard to imagine As Thomas Friedman poi nts out in todays New York Times Palestinian suicide bombers do not targe t yeshivas synagogues or religious settlements They go for shopping mall s or Sbarros outlets Sure they hate the Jews but they hate the West as much or more Israel is not a cause of any of this except to the degree that Israeli cul ture is essentially Western If the present state of Israel were inhabited by Christian Lithuanians or Frenchmen the hatred would be nearly as intens e Nearly not completely Hatred of the Jews has been built into ArabMosl em culture since the time of Mohammed There is a tale you will hear from A rab apologists that the Jews were contented and well treated in the old Ara bMoslem empires This is nonsense More often than not they were treated like swine For a true account read Joan Peterss From Time Immemorial ht efDscbnationalreviewon or Gil Carl Alroy Behind the Middle East Crisisa From the Arab point of view Israel or any We stern state on Arab land is an outrage an illegitimate creation a crus ader state The fact that the Jews had a wealthy and powerful nation on tha t land three thousand years ago counts for nothing Israel is from the poi nt of view of most Arabs an alien graft that must not be allowed to take It is a reminder of what can barely be thought of without acute psychic p ain the squalid hopeless irredeemable inferiority of ones own culture b y comparison with another So so so is this any of Americas business What are we doing meddling in the Middle East Where is our interest Well US politicians must spea k for themselves but if I had any position of authority in any Western nat ion I would be urging full support for Israel and I am not Jewish Follo wing my Passover column derbyshirederbyshir eshtml in fact a lot of NRO readers along with at least one exe ditor of The New Republic believe I am an antiSemite Its a matter of c ultural solidarity We of the West must hang together or else we shall han g separately American isolationists simply do not understand how much we a re hated in other places What after all does the Buchananite program offer us if carried through We have no troops in Israel to be withdrawn If we withdraw our aid the I sraelis will be less able to defend themselves against the Arabs Should we just let the free market take over US arms manufacturers selling weapon s to them cash on the nail Apparently not Several of my correspondents ha ve explained to me that what so enrages the Arabs is the sight of their peo ple being killed by American weapons Oh No weapons then and presumabl y we should try to repatriate the ones they already have lots of luck wit h that guys But if we dont arm the Israelis who will While other hesp erophobic countries China for example are gleefully arming the Arabs a nd other Israelhaters like Iran and pocketing the profits And the end of it all will be what Inevitably without our support it will be the destruction of Israel They are so few and the Arabs so many The Arabs will overwhelm that tiny state and there will be such an orgy o f massacre as has not been seen since the Rape of Nanking And we shall be doing what Watching it on our TVs with a sixpack and a bucket of Nac ho chips in hand Thats the Buchananite vision If so it is a vision of c owards and fools and I want no part of it Israels culture is ours She is part of the West If she goes down we hav e suffered a defeat and the howling jeering forces of barbarism have won a victory You dont have to be Zionist nor even Jewish to support Israel You dont have to be in the pocket of the Israeli congressional lobbies or a suckup to powerful proZionist interests You dont have to pretend not to notice the occasional follies and cruelties of Israeli policy You dont have to forget about the USS Liberty or Jonathan Pollard You just have to think straight You just have to understand that the war between c ivilization and barbarism is being fought today just as it was fought at Ch alons and Tours at the gates of Kiev and Vienna by the hoplites at Marath on and the legions on the Rhine It is as you have heard a thousand times this past few days a war and the thing about war is you have to take si des and close your eyes to your allies imperfections for the duration Th ere isnt any choice What happened this week was not or not only an act of antiAmericanism antiIsraelism or antiSemitism It was in part all t hose things but more than anything else it was an act of hesperophobia
