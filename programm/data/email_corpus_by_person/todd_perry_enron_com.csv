from school His name was Kyle It looked like he was carrying all of his books I thought to myself Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday He must really be a nerd I had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so I shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking I saw a bunch of kids running toward him They ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt His glasses went flying and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes My heart went out to him So I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses I saw a tear in his eye As I handed him his glasses I said Those guys are jerks They really should get lives He looked at me and said Hey thanks There was a big smile on his face It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude I helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived As it turned out he lived near me so I asked him why I had never seen him before He said he had gone to private school before now I would have never hung out with a private school kid before We talked all the way home and I carried his books He turned out to be a pretty cool kid I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with my friends and me He said yes We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle the more I liked him and my friends thought the same of him Monday morning came and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again I stopped him and said Boy you are going to really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday He just laughed and handed me half the books Over the next four years Kyle and I became best friends When we were seniors we began to think about college Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke I knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem He was going to be a doctor and I was going for business on a football scholarship Kyle was valedictorian of our class I teased him all the time about being a nerd He had to prepare a speech for graduation I was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak Graduation day came and I saw Kyle He looked great He was one of those guys that really found him during high school He filled out and actually looked good in glasses He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous Today was one of those days I could see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked him on the back and said Hey big guy youll be great He looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled Thanks he said As he started his speech he cleared his throat and began Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years Your parents your teachers your siblings maybe a coach but mostly your friends I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her I am going to tell you a storyI just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met He had planned to kill himself over the weekend He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldnt have to do it later and was carrying his entire stuff home He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile Thankfully I was saved My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment I saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile Not until that moment did I realize its depth Never underestimate the power of your actions With one small gesture you can change a persons life For better or for worse God puts us all

from school His name was Kyle It looked like he was carrying all of his books I thought to myself Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday He must really be a nerd I had quite a weekend planned parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon so I shrugged my shoulders and went on As I was walking I saw a bunch of kids running toward him They ran at him knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt His glasses went flying and I saw them land in the grass about ten feet from him He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes My heart went out to him So I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses I saw a tear in his eye As I handed him his glasses I said Those guys are jerks They really should get lives He looked at me and said Hey thanks There was a big smile on his face It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude I helped him pick up his books and asked him where he lived As it turned out he lived near me so I asked him why I had never seen him before He said he had gone to private school before now I would have never hung out with a private school kid before We talked all the way home and I carried his books He turned out to be a pretty cool kid I asked him if he wanted to play football on Saturday with my friends and me He said yes We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle the more I liked him and my friends thought the same of him Monday morning came and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again I stopped him and said Boy you are going to really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday He just laughed and handed me half the books Over the next four years Kyle and I became best friends When we were seniors we began to think about college Kyle decided on Georgetown and I was going to Duke I knew that we would always be friends that the miles would never be a problem He was going to be a doctor and I was going for business on a football scholarship Kyle was valedictorian of our class I teased him all the time about being a nerd He had to prepare a speech for graduation I was so glad it wasnt me having to get up there and speak Graduation day came and I saw Kyle He looked great He was one of those guys that really found him during high school He filled out and actually looked good in glasses He had more dates than I had and all the girls loved him Boy sometimes I was jealous Today was one of those days I could see that he was nervous about his speech So I smacked him on the back and said Hey big guy youll be great He looked at me with one of those looks the really grateful one and smiled Thanks he said As he started his speech he cleared his throat and began Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years Your parents your teachers your siblings maybe a coach but mostly your friends I am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give him or her I am going to tell you a storyI just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met He had planned to kill himself over the weekend He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldnt have to do it later and was carrying his entire stuff home He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile Thankfully I was saved My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome popular boy told us all about his weakest moment I saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile Not until that moment did I realize its depth Never underestimate the power of your actions With one small gesture you can change a persons life For better or for worse God puts us all in each others lives to impact one another in some way Look for God in others You now have two choices you can Pass this on to your friends or Delete it and act like it didnt touch your heart As you can see I took choice number Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly Its National Friendship Week Show your friends how much you really care Eleanor Roosevelt wrote Many people will walk in and out of your life but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart To handle yourself use your head to handle others use your heart Anger is only one letter short of danger If someone betrays you once it is his fault if he betrays you twice it is your fault Great minds discuss ideas Average minds discuss events Small minds discuss people He who loses money loses much He who loses a friend loses much more He who loses faith loses all Beautiful young people are accidents of nature but beautiful old people are works of art Learn from the mistakes of others You cant live long enough to make them all yourself Friends you and me you brought another friend and then there were We started our group our circle of friends and like that circle there is no beginning or end Yesterday is history Tomorrows a mystery Today is a gift Its National Friendship Week Show your friends how much you care Send this to everyone you consider a FRIEND If it comes back to you then youll know you have a circle of friends WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER YOURE REQUESTED TO SEND IT TO AT LEAST PEOPLE INCLUDING THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU
