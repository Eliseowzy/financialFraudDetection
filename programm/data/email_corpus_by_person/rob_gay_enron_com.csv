your message about the loan extensions and Central Bank registrations I have been working with Celso Bernardi Rafael Rangel and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado Meyer on this Also I am preparing sort of a critical path items checklist on the subdebt that John Barquin and I are going to discuss with John Novak tomorrow at am After we work through it I would be glad to forward it to you In short and in answer to your specific question as advised by Machado Meyer I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all of the subdebt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements between EPE and GasMat as Borrowers and then the respective Enron and Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December as the note from Celso below explains Then we will just deliver request for extension letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to reflect the new maturity date This should all be done before the existing loans mature on December Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep you apprised of any developments Regards Melissa Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Cc Subject RE FW Cuiaba subdebt Melissa as agreed in the Cuiaba Owners Meeting yesterday by Rick Enron and Johannes Shell we need to extend the maturity date of the

Rick Enron Gay Rob Enron Barquin John Subject RE FW Cuiaba subdebt FYI Regarding Ricks note about the default interest I have spoken to Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of MMSO regarding what we need to do to document the extensions Fabio says that we can have a simple loan agreement I would assume there would be one between each Lender and the EnronShell borrowers where the various parties agree to the extension The notes would not have to be reprintedreplaced and can remain as they are We would just send notification letters to the Central Bank requesting that the existing registrations be

add this to our list to discuss on the call this evening Beckworth Melissa on PM To Novak John Enron cc Subject FW Cuiaba subdebt John What do you think Can I go forward with this extension of the subdebt until June Original Message From Beckworth Melissa Sent Tuesday November PM To Novak John Enron Barquin John Cc Subject FW Cuiaba subdebt Importance High JohnJohn We have a new subdebt issue The existing shareholder subordinated loan promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of December or the closing of thirdparty financing and the Central Bank registrations reflect that Celso has requested MMSO to draft letters to the Central Bank asking for an extension of the maturity to June He says that Johannes Walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for Shell but that he has had no response from Enron I think he sent a message to Novak Powell Lammers Rangel Walzebuck and Dutton on Nov The AR SFA doesnt have an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached which carries the maturity date the notes are to be considered a part of the agreement The form of note attached to the AR SFA carries default interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence the ones that were just printed do not have default interest provisions we had to match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered payment condition Unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope that we can collect default interest I have asked MMSO what we need to do I assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date We would then send the notification letters to the Central Bank notifying them of the extension We also need to address this in the nd A to the AR SFA My note below tries to explain what all is going on with the various assignments and notifications The main thing I need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are from an Enron perspective and how you wish for me to proceed Do you need to talk to LammersPowellGay Let me know Regards Melissa Original Message From Beckworth Melissa Sent Tuesday November PM To Araujo Renata Jayme De Cc Barquin John Novak John Enron Hopkinson Rick Enron Subject Cuiaba subdebt Celso I apologize that I have not been able to speak with you about this I do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously and I have been out of the office without access to my email or international service all day today The Amended and Restated Shareholders Funding Agreement will have to be amended there is a nd Amendment in draft form right now that has not been finalized to include a new form of note with the new maturity date We will also have to draft some form of letter agreementwaiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously issued promissory notes is being extended perhaps this can just be an additional provision in the nd amendment Fabio and Irenne Will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there any other way to address this effectively under Brazilian law Also Fabio and Irenne with respect to the notification letters for the TR Buyout loans I wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the notices of assignment to the Central Bank because the loans that were assigned and the loans mentioned in the letters do not encompass all of the shareholder loans The Shell assignment agreement for the SGL to SCHL assignment for EPE should be complete within the next few days and is dated as of September I assume Shell has notification letters to deliver as well for that assignment Did you receive my fax with the markup of the notification letters Maybe we could do this in two steps Deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the Transredes Buyout and for the Shell assignment of EPE loans from SGL to STDCL Execute nd Amendment to A R Shareholders Funding Agreement with new form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of maturity date of existing loans complete the Enron assignments of the replacement notes for EPE and GasMat credits to Enron Netherlands Holdings BV and notify the Central Bank of the extension of the maturity date on the existing promissory notes and of the Enron assignments The reason I suggest this breakdown is that the items in number are basically complete and have been approved The others are not complete yet and could be done in the next week or two I know this is a lot to coordinate you can let me know if you have

NRON Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard nron cc Subject Questions re Siemens Negotiations We will need to craft a response Forwarded by Rob G GayNAEnron on AM on AM To cc Subject Questions re Siemens Negotiations Rob Weve reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your negotiations with Siemens Following are comments and questions regarding certain negotiated points EOT Claim Agreement Owner must operate and maintain per OM manuals and industry practices on oil if not owner must correct items materially affecting Contractors commissioning obligations We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations it is introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the owner for affecting the Contractors ability to commission Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas We understand that the Facility is under the care custody and control of the Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance coverage intended for the commercial operating period versus the construction period Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance coverage if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor action during commissioning on gas We are also advising the Lenders to have this point reviewed by an insurance advisor Degradation agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during commissioning During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of curves It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the benefit of Siemens We trust that your operations experts will diligently review the basis for the curves Performance LDs on gas per the EPC contract with first forgiven by owner Please explain the rationale behind forgiving million of Contractor LDs Delay LDs on gas do not start until days after performance test on gas During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand down until when gas is available no LDs would be paid related to oil firing performance and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is not complete within days We do not understand the above negotiated point Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated point TAA Agreement No month look back We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored into the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result of dropping below the availability standards Please explain how this negotiated point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how availability will be calculated As we noted during our last conference call we are concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not being dispatched month Initial Guarantee Period with the clock suspended for gas commissioning unless owner delay We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the month clock for the initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it takes the Contractor to commission on gas unless delays are attributable to Owner and restarts after Contractor has successfully completed the performance testing on gas Please confirm that our understanding is correct In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas if there are additional delays on the PL our Insurance group has indicated that we will have no problem obtaining months renewable business interruption insurance when we go operational on gas This should solve the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects design and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits etc Incidentally for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE which is not a new technology designation The duration of BI coverage is months per event with US deductible Stone Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review this point Thanks in advance for your response Hope all is well Regards Bradley

does it apply to their ability to contract for long term capacit y without a bid RKG Renata Kogut Gurevich on P M To cc CEB Cludia Bonelli PGS Pedro G Seraphim Subject RE PPA Notice of Intent to Terminate Dear John We have discussed the issues raised in the conference call today with our Litigation Department and we have come to the following conclusions In order to assure that EPE will not loose its right to terminate the PPA we suggest EPE to adopt one of the following solutions i send to Furnas the alternative letter which says that although the cu re period is already over EPE based on the progress on the issues related to the lender consent extends the day cure period by another days or ii send to Furnas the Notice of Intent to Terminate tomorrow and after t he day consultation period extend such consultation period by another days We believe that EPE should not send the Notice of Intent to Terminate witho ut extending either the cure or the consultation period for the PPA and the Brazilian legislation are not clear about the possibility of EPE to exercis e its right to terminate the PPA after the day consultation period Note that both solutions will only postpone the proceeding for EPE will ha ve to decide whether it intends to terminate the PPA or not On the other hand we believe that there will be no termination process without arbitration as Furnas and Eletrobrs have already denied the occurrence of a causa de inadimplemento under the PPA Regarding the possibility for EPE to start the whole process again based o n the same causa de inadimplemento we believe that this proceeding would b e very fragile and could be challenged by Furnas and Eletrobrs As a result we do not suggest you to adopt this alternative Finally according to section XXII of Federal Law No Furnas may contract the supplying of electric energy without a previous bidding process Regards Cludia Bonelli Here are the notices to be discussed in our call today at pm sao paulo

letter is fine As an alternative I would like you to prepare another letter today that extends the day period of inadimplemento by another days the tone of the letter should be based on the progress we have seen toward resolution of the issues related to the lender consent we hereby agree to extend the period of inadimplemento another days to give the parties and opportunity to resolve these matters prior to deliver of the notice of intent to terminate I would like you to have this letter ready by pm today if possible so I can clear it onmy global task list call tonite Andreia please contact Claudia today and ask her to please try to comply with this request and ask her to participate in todays global task list call for the first few minutes PGS Pedro G Seraphim on PM To cc CEB Cludia Bonelli PGS Pedro G Seraphim RKG Renata Kogut Gurevich Subject RE PPA Notice of Intent to Terminate Attached is a revised draft notice which became more of a warning than a notice and which also was corrected as suggested by Guido Renno The PPA does not contain a provision stating the delay in enforcing a right should not be deemed a waiver of that right But also it does not require that the notice of intent to terminate be served right after the day cure period Therefore we can wait to send the actual notice of intent to terminate A remark the cure period is of days and not It expires in the next couple of days if not already I am not sure what strength this warning could have maybe not much more than a threat I understand that starting the termination process is a very serious step with a lot of implications and I fully respect the decision of just sending the warning I would only ask whether this task would not be better achieved by informal contacts rather than a formal letter A small correction notices may be served by courts or by notaries but that is not required by law unless in specific circumstances The PPA does not provide for any formal notification procedure and thus there would be no need to do it by courts or notaries If you need to discuss any point on this document during Tuesday or Wednesday please look for Cludia Bonelli as I will be out

alternative My recommendation would be to phrase Considerao de trmino do CONTRATO This still gives a signal but is not starting a mechanism which would be difficult to stop I have also copied Guido

Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Felipe NRON Marcus nron Lutz SpeidelENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EPE Dispatch Rob Until now FURNAS has not agreed to pay for the oil for MW If ONS dispatch the power plant for MW we do not have reinburshment for the amount above MW We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at the same time They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis and giving the answers at beginning of the new year About if there is any documents about this subject the answer is no Second point Under the FURNASs point of view these constrains in the transmission system is good for both FURNAS and EPE because from the EPEs side we receive all invoice available capacity and even if the plant is in the merit order it will not be dispatched because these constrains So in this case we do not consume oil more than MW and FURNAS will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be constrain off in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not dispatched Best regards Lcio Reis Forwarded by Jose Lucio ReisSAEnron on Rob G Gay To Jose Lucio nron cc

Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron Tracee NRON Felipe NRON Subject Re EPE Dispatch Rob Regarding items and please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he can explain Item is incorrect The MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at about MW each and the remaining MW coming from the steam turbine The steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output theoretically at least in practice depending on optimization of machines Again please talk with Lucio Regards Christiaan Rob G NRON PM To Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron cc Tracee CT Subject EPE Dispatch Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for MW on oil to meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve margin We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above MW Do we have any document which could substantiate this Although dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full time with MW available there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring Please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to debottleneck and how long this will take I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures Based on our analysis the optimal operating approach would be to generate MW with one turbine and MW with the other for a total of if dipatched above MW If we can prove that are correct or convince the lenders that they are then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by April We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue Garvin flex months Therefore a merit order analysis is only necessary if i our supposition about Furnas motivations are incorrect andor ii the transmission problem is cleared If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a reduced dispatch during daily offpeak hours or seasonal impacts b due to scheduled outages and c due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses Any data you can provide will be

the power plant for MW we do not have reinburshment for the amount above MW We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at the same time They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis and giving the answers at beginning of the new year About if there is any documents about this subject the answer is no Second point Under the FURNASs point of view these constrains in the transmission system is good for both FURNAS and EPE because from the EPEs side we receive all invoice available capacity and even if the plant is in the merit order it will not be dispatched because these constrains So in this case we do not consume oil more than MW and FURNAS will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be constrain off in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not dispatched Best regards Lcio Reis Forwarded by Jose Lucio ReisSAEnron on Rob G Gay To Jose Lucio nron cc

Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron Tracee NRON Felipe NRON Subject Re EPE Dispatch Rob Regarding items and please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he can explain Item is incorrect The MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at about MW each and the remaining MW coming from the steam turbine The steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output theoretically at least in practice depending on optimization of machines Again please talk with Lucio Regards Christiaan Rob G NRON PM To Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron cc Tracee CT Subject EPE Dispatch Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for MW on oil to meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve margin We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above MW Do we have any document which could substantiate this Although dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full time with MW available there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring Please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to debottleneck and how long this will take I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures Based on our analysis the optimal operating approach would be to generate MW with one turbine and MW with the other for a total of if dipatched above MW If we can prove that are correct or convince the lenders that they are then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by April We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue Garvin flex months Therefore a merit order analysis is only necessary if i our supposition about Furnas motivations are incorrect andor ii the transmission problem is cleared If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a reduced dispatch during daily offpeak hours or seasonal impacts b due to scheduled outages and c due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses Any data you can provide will be

your message about the loan extensions and Central Bank registrations I have been working with Celso Bernardi Rafael Rangel and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado

glad to forward it to you In short and in answer to your specific question as advised by Machado Meyer I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all of the subdebt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements between EPE and GasMat as Borrowers and then the respective Enron and Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December as the note from Celso below explains Then we will just deliver request for extension letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to reflect the new maturity date This should all be done before the existing loans mature on December Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep you apprised of any developments Regards Melissa Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday November PM To Cc Subject RE FW Cuiaba subdebt Melissa as agreed in the Cuiaba Owners Meeting yesterday by Rick Enron and Johannes Shell we need to extend the maturity date of the

Rick Enron Gay Rob Enron Barquin John Subject RE FW Cuiaba subdebt FYI Regarding Ricks note about the default interest I have spoken to Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of MMSO regarding what we need to do to document the extensions Fabio says that we can have a simple loan agreement I would assume there would be one between each Lender and the EnronShell borrowers where the various parties agree to the extension The notes would not have to be reprintedreplaced and can remain as they are We would just send notification letters to the Central Bank requesting that the existing registrations be amended to reflect the extension Rick Hopkinson is checking with Raquel Novais and Fabio Yamada of MMSO regarding any possible Brazilian tax issues that would arise from this transactionextension I

add this to our list to discuss on the call this evening Beckworth Melissa on PM To Novak John Enron cc Subject FW Cuiaba subdebt John What do you think Can I go forward with this extension of the subdebt until June Original Message From Beckworth Melissa Sent Tuesday November PM To Novak John Enron Barquin John Cc Subject FW Cuiaba subdebt Importance High JohnJohn We have a new subdebt issue The existing shareholder subordinated loan promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of December or the closing of thirdparty financing and the Central Bank registrations reflect that Celso has requested MMSO to draft letters to the Central Bank asking for an extension of the maturity to June He says that Johannes Walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for Shell but that he has had no response from Enron I think he sent a message to Novak Powell Lammers Rangel Walzebuck and Dutton on Nov The AR SFA doesnt have an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached which carries the maturity date the notes are to be considered a part of the agreement The form of note attached to the AR SFA carries default interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence the ones that were just printed do not have default interest provisions we had to match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered payment condition Unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope that we can collect default interest I have asked MMSO what we need to do I assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date We would then send the notification letters to the Central Bank notifying them of the extension We also need to address this in the nd A to the AR SFA My note below tries to explain what all is going on with the various assignments and notifications The main thing I need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are from an Enron perspective and how you wish for me to proceed Do you need to talk to LammersPowellGay Let me know Regards Melissa Original Message From Beckworth Melissa Sent Tuesday November PM To Araujo Renata Jayme De Cc Barquin John Novak John Enron Hopkinson Rick Enron Subject Cuiaba subdebt Celso I apologize that I have not been able to speak with you about this I do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously and I have been out of the office without access to my email or international service all day today The Amended and Restated Shareholders Funding Agreement will have to be amended there is a nd Amendment in draft form right now that has not been finalized to include a new form of note with the new maturity date We will also have to draft some form of letter agreementwaiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously issued promissory notes is being extended perhaps this can just be an additional provision in the nd amendment Fabio and Irenne Will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there any other way to address this effectively under Brazilian law Also Fabio and Irenne with respect to the notification letters for the TR Buyout loans I wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the notices of assignment to the Central Bank because the loans that were assigned and the loans mentioned in the letters do not encompass all of the shareholder loans The Shell assignment agreement for the SGL to SCHL assignment for EPE should be complete within the next few days and is dated as of September I assume Shell has notification letters to deliver as well for that assignment Did you receive my fax with the markup of the notification letters Maybe we could do this in two steps Deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the Transredes Buyout and for the Shell assignment of EPE loans from SGL to STDCL Execute nd Amendment to A R Shareholders Funding Agreement with new form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of maturity date of existing loans complete the Enron assignments of the replacement notes for EPE and GasMat credits to Enron Netherlands Holdings BV and notify the Central Bank of the extension of the maturity date on the existing promissory notes and of the Enron assignments The reason I suggest this breakdown is that the items in number are basically complete and have been approved The others are not complete yet and could be done in the next week or two I know this is a lot to coordinate you can let me know if you have suggestions about the different steps we should take and in what order I will try to speak to John and John about the Enron approvals on this and get back to everyone Regards Melissa Original Message

Celso Araujo Renata Jayme De on To cc Beckworth Melissa Subject RE Alteracao de Certificado de Registro Dear all I have spoken with Irene and she will get the remaining copies from Ricardo Pinto from Machado Meyer and Sandra Vassel Irene has told me that the change in the dates of the certificates is due to the fact that the loans that are going to be used to repay the amounts reflected in the certificates are not going to be granted this year but only mid next year Therefore the current date would be changed to June th Celso I would like to ask you to kindly confirm this understanding since Irene has told me that you asked her to make the letters to the Central Bank notifying the date change but she had not had more details about the matter Finally Melissa has asked Machado Meyer whether the current drafts of the letters to the Central Bank notifying the two assignment of credits from Transredes to Enron and Shell so called Transredes Byout and from Shell Generating to Shell

NRON Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard nron cc Subject Questions re Siemens Negotiations We will need to craft a response Forwarded by Rob G GayNAEnron on AM on AM To cc Subject Questions re Siemens Negotiations Rob Weve reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your negotiations with Siemens Following are comments and questions regarding certain negotiated points EOT Claim Agreement Owner must operate and maintain per OM manuals and industry practices on oil if not owner must correct items materially affecting Contractors commissioning obligations We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations it is introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the owner for affecting the Contractors ability to commission Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas We understand that the Facility is under the care custody and control of the Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance coverage intended for the commercial operating period versus the construction period Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance coverage if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor action during commissioning on gas We are also advising the Lenders to have this point reviewed by an insurance advisor Degradation agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during commissioning During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of curves It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the benefit of Siemens We trust that your operations experts will diligently review the basis for the curves Performance LDs on gas per the EPC contract with first forgiven by owner Please explain the rationale behind forgiving million of Contractor LDs Delay LDs on gas do not start until days after performance test on gas During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand down until when gas is available no LDs would be paid related to oil firing performance and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is not complete within days We do not understand the above negotiated point Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated point TAA Agreement No month look back We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored into the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result of dropping below the availability standards Please explain how this negotiated point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how availability will be calculated As we noted during our last conference call we are concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not being dispatched month Initial Guarantee Period with the clock suspended for gas commissioning unless owner delay We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the month clock for the initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it takes the Contractor to commission on gas unless delays are attributable to Owner and restarts after Contractor has successfully completed the performance testing on gas Please confirm that our understanding is correct In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas if there are additional delays on the PL our Insurance group has indicated that we will have no problem obtaining months renewable business interruption insurance when we go operational on gas This should solve the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects design and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits etc Incidentally for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE which is not a new technology designation The duration of BI coverage is months per event with US deductible Stone Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review this point Thanks in advance for your response Hope all is well Regards Bradley

does it apply to their ability to contract for long term capacit y without a bid RKG Renata Kogut Gurevich on P M To cc CEB Cludia Bonelli PGS Pedro G Seraphim Subject RE PPA Notice of Intent to Terminate Dear John We have discussed the issues raised in the conference call today with our Litigation Department and we have come to the following conclusions In order to assure that EPE will not loose its right to terminate the PPA we suggest EPE to adopt one of the following solutions i send to Furnas the alternative letter which says that although the cu re period is already over EPE based on the progress on the issues related to the lender consent extends the day cure period by another days or ii send to Furnas the Notice of Intent to Terminate tomorrow and after t he day consultation period extend such consultation period by another days We believe that EPE should not send the Notice of Intent to Terminate witho ut extending either the cure or the consultation period for the PPA and the Brazilian legislation are not clear about the possibility of EPE to exercis e its right to terminate the PPA after the day consultation period Note that both solutions will only postpone the proceeding for EPE will ha ve to decide whether it intends to terminate the PPA or not On the other hand we believe that there will be no termination process without arbitration as Furnas and Eletrobrs have already denied the occurrence of a causa de inadimplemento under the PPA Regarding the possibility for EPE to start the whole process again based o n the same causa de inadimplemento we believe that this proceeding would b e very fragile and could be challenged by Furnas and Eletrobrs As a result we do not suggest you to adopt this alternative Finally according to section XXII of Federal Law No Furnas may contract the supplying of electric energy without a previous bidding process Regards Cludia Bonelli Here are the notices to be discussed in our call today at pm sao paulo

letter is fine As an alternative I would like you to prepare another letter today that extends the day period of inadimplemento by another days the tone of the letter should be based on the progress we have seen toward resolution of the issues related to the lender consent we hereby agree to extend the period of inadimplemento another days to give the parties and opportunity to resolve these matters prior to deliver of the notice of intent to terminate I would like you to have this letter ready by pm today if possible so I can clear it onmy global task list call tonite Andreia please contact Claudia today and ask her to please try to comply with this request and ask her to participate in todays global task list call for the first few minutes PGS Pedro G Seraphim on PM To cc CEB Cludia Bonelli PGS Pedro G Seraphim RKG Renata Kogut Gurevich Subject RE PPA Notice of Intent to Terminate Attached is a revised draft notice which became more of a warning than a notice and which also was corrected as suggested by Guido Renno The PPA does not contain a provision stating the delay in enforcing a right should not be deemed a waiver of that right But also it does not require that the notice of intent to terminate be served right after the day cure period Therefore we can wait to send the actual notice of intent to terminate A remark the cure period is of days and not It expires in the next couple of days if not already I am not sure what strength this warning could have maybe not much more than a threat I understand that starting the termination process is a very serious step with a lot of implications and I fully respect the decision of just sending the warning I would only ask whether this task would not be better achieved by informal contacts rather than a formal letter A small correction notices may be served by courts or by notaries but that is not required by law unless in specific circumstances The PPA does not provide for any formal notification procedure and thus there would be no need to do it by courts or notaries If you need to discuss any point on this document during Tuesday or Wednesday please look for Cludia Bonelli as I will be out

alternative My recommendation would be to phrase Considerao de trmino do CONTRATO This still gives a signal but is not starting a mechanism which would be difficult to stop I have also copied Guido

Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Felipe NRON Marcus nron Lutz SpeidelENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Re EPE Dispatch Rob Until now FURNAS has not agreed to pay for the oil for MW If ONS dispatch the power plant for MW we do not have reinburshment for the amount above MW We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at the same time They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis and giving the answers at beginning of the new year About if there is any documents about this subject the answer is no Second point Under the FURNASs point of view these constrains in the transmission system is good for both FURNAS and EPE because from the EPEs side we receive all invoice available capacity and even if the plant is in the merit order it will not be dispatched because these constrains So in this case we do not consume oil more than MW and FURNAS will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be constrain off in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not dispatched Best regards Lcio Reis Forwarded by Jose Lucio ReisSAEnron on Rob G Gay To Jose Lucio nron cc

Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron Tracee NRON Felipe NRON Subject Re EPE Dispatch Rob Regarding items and please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he can explain Item is incorrect The MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at about MW each and the remaining MW coming from the steam turbine The steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output theoretically at least in practice depending on optimization of machines Again please talk with Lucio Regards Christiaan Rob G NRON PM To Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Christiaan HuizerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Richard A nron cc Tracee CT Subject EPE Dispatch Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for MW on oil to meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve margin We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above MW Do we have any document which could substantiate this Although dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full time with MW available there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring Please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to debottleneck and how long this will take I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures Based on our analysis the optimal operating approach would be to generate MW with one turbine and MW with the other for a total of if dipatched above MW If we can prove that are correct or convince the lenders that they are then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by April We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue Garvin flex months Therefore a merit order analysis is only necessary if i our supposition about Furnas motivations are incorrect andor ii the transmission problem is cleared If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a reduced dispatch during daily offpeak hours or seasonal impacts b due to scheduled outages and c due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses Any data you can provide will be
