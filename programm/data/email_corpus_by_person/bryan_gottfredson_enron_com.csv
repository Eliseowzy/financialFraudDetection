CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SEEKS PROBE OF POWER CUTBACK AZ Republic The State Davis Upbeat on Billion Edison Plan LA Times Power Politics in the Senate New York Times A SelfInflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over Enron New York Times DWP Far Exceeded Profit It Reported Energy An independent audit finds the utilitys return was double the the agency said it made selling power during the crisis Officials deny price gouging By DOUG SMITH and RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J LOPEZ TIMES STAFF WRITERS During the peak of Californias power crisis the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged according to a newly completed independent audit The document obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private outofstate generating companies For months DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just above its costs As recently as July former DWP chief S David Freeman who now heads Davis new statewide power authority repeated that assurance in a letter to US senators probing the energy meltdown But the audit findings show that DWPs profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged last year under Freemans stewardship Overall during the worst months of the crisis ending in May records show that the DWP profited million on sales of million It says it is still owed million Beyond those higher profits the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity They include a million cut for the citys general fundessentially a bonus for the utilitys ownerand an additional million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agencys capital investments These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators In effect unsuspecting ratepayers across the state whose utilities have been battered by debt are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay In an interview late last week Freeman defended those costs and DWPs profits saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants He insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than We made a fair amount of money It was not price gouging said Freeman who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than then Im not embarrassed about it It says nothing more than theres enterprise at the DWP The DWPs new general manager David Wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freemans tenure Maybe in hindsight Wiggs said it would have been better not to be so specific but to say Look were gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers Still Wiggs said even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive We charged just and reasonable rates he said adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin Wiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity Conducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers the study targeted a month period beginning in May The results have provided critics with new ammunition Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said Harry Snyder senior advocate for Consumers Union This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companiesnot a public agency Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee which is investigating the crisis was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWPs profits were limited to This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny he said after learning of the audit It would be ironic if it turns out that the LA Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov Davis Texas Pirates said Thompson The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding To keep the power flowing the DWPwhich had opted out of deregulationcranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market This helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced At the same time however the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports would later show Freeman repeatedly said the utilitys prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly inefficient plants But the audit raises such serious questions about the DWPs behavior that the matter has spilled into the gubernatorial contest Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a possible Republican challenger to Davis last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure In a letter to his successor James K Hahn the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling If so he said the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales A Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales said Jaime de la Vega a senior advisor to Riordans campaign committee Freeman now squarely in the Davis camp disputes Riordans account He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agencys pricing strategy He wanted to charge more according to Freeman in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison which were slipping into insolvency Freeman described Riordans view as If were gonna continue to sell it to them we ought to get a lot of money He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it For the most part the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in Californias haywire energy market Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market including his agency But according to a report by the states grid operator DWP was one of the most aggressive along with the trading arm of BC Hydro the governmentowned utility in British Columbia Yet another reportthis one by the states powerbuying agencyfound that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year The report said DWP charged an average of per megawatt hour asking more than many private generators It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year the DWP collected profits more than higher than it claimed to have netted records show Overall during the month period audited profits averaged double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texasbased energy suppliers Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of governmentowned utilities One key question is whether those agencies like private suppliers should be forced to refund excess profits The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged DWP insists it is outside the commissions jurisdiction But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities The leading proponent of that course is state Sen Ray Haynes RRiverside In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of instate public utility agencies The chairman of that committee Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs Energy With one week left in the legislative session lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how California will recoup its expenditures during power crisis After a summer of delays California regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities The energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis The state needs to recoup more than billion that it has spent on power and it has signed billion in longterm electricity contracts Final plans for meeting these financial obligationsand spreading the pain of paying them offhave been debated for months But the decision time has come Legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on Friday and the state Public Utilities Commission is under pressure to act on several longpending measures at a meeting on Thursday Whats before the state both at the PUC and the Legislature is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come PUC President Loretta M Lynch said in an interview Are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power or are we going to rely on the state The PUC which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year now faces another tough choice Should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state Department of Water Resources an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts Or should it balk and jeopardize the states planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans Legislation on Related Issues Legislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues One seeks to repair the finances of Southern California Edison through a billion aid plan backed by Gov Gray Davis The other would limit the powers of the Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for million customers of Edison Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric since January The state law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power exempted the purchases from PUC reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges Now the department is seeking a formal agreement with the PUC that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered Critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future State officials say the PUC has little choice but to sign the agreement which they see as necessary to reassure Wall Street bankers that the Department of Water Resources will be able to repay billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs The money from those bonds will go in part to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power Top state officials including the governor and treasurer want the bond sale to go without a hitch but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months and threatened litigation could further delay it The urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used billion from the treasury and has taken out a billion loan to cover power costs State Treasurer Phil Angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early s People ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question What is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding he said Lynch one of three Davis appointees on the fivemember PUC finds herself in a particularly difficult position She sees the value of PUC reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases But Lynch said If we do not enter into a rate agreement the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund The thing I care about most she added is ensuring the general fund is repaid Earlier this month Lynch issued a draft decision that would have the PUC essentially rubberstamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the Department of Water Resources But she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state Sen John Burton DSan Francisco that the Davis administration opposes The bill would ensure that the PUC has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the Department of Water Resources and hold public hearings It would not however give the PUC the power to disallow department expenses To reassure Wall Street the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds At a PUC meeting last Thursday PUC commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque appointees of former Gov Pete Wilson voiced support for the Burton bill saying it would let the PUC shed additional light on the Department of Water Resources powerrelated expenditures The Davis administration opposes the bills present form but is seeking amendments One concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short bondholders would be paid before they are The bills passage could be a deal breaker for the bond sales said contractor Joseph Fichera a financial advisor to Davis At the least contentious debate surrounding energyrelated issues could drive up the price of floating bonds Fichera said Wall Street does not like risk Conflict implies risk So the more we create the more we are costing ratepayers he said The Legislature also is considering a bill that would allow Edison to sell bonds to pay off about threequarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis The utility would have to handle on its own about billion owed to large energy companies Consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill which they call a bailout The PUC on Thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the Department of Water Resources bonds One is a rate increase for SDGE customers Another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets an organization that includes many large California businesses said its members would be forced to sue if the PUC goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers But the most controversial item has been the proposed PUC agreement with the Department of Water Resources Consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the departments contracts and revenue requirements The plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers money said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Secrecy in DWR leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates Concerns about the Department of Water Resources lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments Energy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest Critics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of million in July although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with longterm power contracts And the departments projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures PGE Threatens to Sue Over Revenue The utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years If the PUC does not provide for that lawsuits could be coming PGE which already is in bankruptcy has threatened to sue if the Department of Water Resources revenue requirement doesnt leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in March PGE recently asked a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to require the Department of Water Resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements The company has reacted angrily to a draft PUC decision to shift million of the states cost of buying power from Edison to PGE saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against PGE customers Davis aides have defended the Department of Water Resources and its power purchases saying the departments longterm contracts helped cool the energy crisis They look overpriced now Fichera said But four months ago they were underpriced compared with the spot market They are an insurance policy against market volatility Having the PUC review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose Fichera said because the contracts already are in place You cant break contracts he said Youve got to pay them Even some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the Department of Water Resources performance to date One reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage Another reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis We all have hindsight said PUC Commissioner Bilas When DWR entered into contracts the state was over the barrel Now we can say that they are not as good as the department thought and that DWR does a lousy job of negotiating contracts But thats unfair Green energy sources seen as ripe for growth By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Sept Wind and hot water sunshine and rotting garbage They all could keep Californias lights on for a price Around the state more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the states power roller coaster This week Sacramentos municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on nonhydroelectric sources of renewable electric power such as wind farms and solar panels In the Legislature a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of green power rising to percent of their portfolios by That would roughly double current supplies This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed said state Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto author of SB More than a dozen states and many nations already have portfolio standards that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources The amounts can be as low as percent or percent or as high as partly depending on what gets called renewable Environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea saying it would bring a constellation of advantages The air would be cleaner they say Finite resources such as coal natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly And in California the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants But freemarket advocates and some utilities are dubious They worry that a statemandated portfolio standard would drive up prices It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own And in the push to diversify from natural gas critics of such standards dont want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources including coal nuclear power and new large dams Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted and I think not considering nuclear options within the state at least giving it some public hearing is shortsighted said Karal Cottrell a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director It is a debate that will help shape Californias power future and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants Just over half of instate electricity production now is fueled by natural gas but that could rise to percent by if all currently proposed gasfired plants are built said Mark Bernstein an energy analyst at RAND Long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the states power picture We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything particularly energy these days said Bernstein What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up That fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays hydro power with its risks of short supplies in dry years and natural gas Already considered a leader in renewable power SMUD gets about percent of its electricity from nonhydro renewables In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday it will seek public feedback on a proposed year plan that would raise that amount to percent by and percent by If we commit to this this will be the largest renewable commitment I believe in the state right now General Manager Jan Schori told directors Renewable power would cost more but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatthour for renewables At first SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage That should get the utility close to percent By staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase boosting green power another percent at a livable price The likeliest costeffective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power said Tracy Thats also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday Wind turbines once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity have become bigger more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade Aided by a federal tax credit they now can supply power at between cents and cents a kilowatthour depending on location according to the American Wind Energy Association At its lower end that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant Geothermal power tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water runs between cents and cents a kilowatthour and could go lower if it too qualifies for the next round of federal credits plant developers say Both sources of power are plentiful in California The state is the th best source of wind in the nation with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state Geothermal power already makes up percent of the states supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped By comparison solar power costs more than cents a kilowatthour although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity Both wind and geothermal could be a shooin economically if natural gas prices float higher said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs Today its also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard We think the standard is going to save consumers money or in the worst case its like an insurance policy said Freedman I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days But with only a week left to go Freedman said the enemy of Shers bill is time Thats actually just one of the enemies Others include Sempra Energy parent company of San Diego Gas Electric Co and the California Manufacturers Association which fear it would boost electric rates When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible is this really a good time for this asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik Both Sempra and the Assemblys Republican caucus point out that more than million a year already is collected from consumers electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy The portfolio standard could have Californians paying again up to the cents per kilowatthour cap in the bill for power that theyve already helped subsidize they say Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth RTemecula To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation California already gets about percent of its total energy supply including imports from nonhydro renewables and an additional percent from small hydro The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to percent by So to Sher author of the renewables bill raising that amount to percent by is actually a modest goal Were well on our way there he said Dan Walters As Davis and Burton spar big Capitol agenda remains unsettled Published Sept Theres no scientifically objective method of measuring such things the world still awaits the invention of a procrastimeter but its evident that as the final week of the legislative session begins there are an extraordinary number of pithy issues left to be resolved Although procrastination is a Capitol perennial whats different his year is that so many of them are significant matters of public policy that cannot simply roll over into including major pieces of the energy crisis puzzle such as Gov Gray Davis bailout of Southern California Edison Also on the pending agenda are redrawing legislative and congressional district boundaries multibilliondollar bond issues for schools and colleges a slew of labor benefit bills that business leaders call job killers a drive by trial lawyers to make it easier to open up confidential lawsuit settlements consumer protection measures that include those affecting privacy and predatory lending expansion of rights for gays and undocumented immigrants community college support and a potentially sweeping measure to expand health care access for the states huge uninsured population Why has so much been left to the final hours Some of it is human nature compounded by political skittishness But the extraordinary amount of serious legislating left to the last minute this year reflects both the unusual circumstances of this years session especially the energy crisis and an escalating conflict between the Capitols two most powerful Democrats Gov Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton The first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and then by a partisan conflict over the state budget as Californias economy softened and revenues dipped sharply Other legislative matters drifted until summers heat enveloped the Capitol The more important factor may be the DavisBurton feud which manifests itself in many ways but particularly on the two most important pieces of latesession business the Davissponsored Edison bailout and a multibilliondollar boost in benefits for workers with jobrelated illnesses and injuries carried personally by Burton As it happens the price tag on each is similar The Edison measure would authorize the utility to issue billion in bonds to repay its debts and at least in theory step back from the brink of bankruptcy The workers compensation bill sent to Davis desk last week would boost benefits by a similar amount each year Burton has denounced the Edison bill as a raid on ratepayers while Davis has in the past vetoed similar workers compensation measures and is being urged to do it again by employers who list it at the top of their job killer bills The two politicians have so much prestige on the line with the two measures that there have been recurrent rumors of a squeeze play in which Davis would have to agree to sign the workers comp bill to get his muchcherished Edison bailout although no one will say so publicly The BurtonDavis conflict however is far broader than these two bills They represent in effect the two faces of the Democratic Party Davis the cool businessfriendly centrist and Burton the passionate labororiented liberal and their personal relationship is practically nil Burton openly despises Davis as a betrayer of party principle and trashes him to anyone within earshot Davis is more circumspect but those around him contend in effect that if liberals like Burton had their way the Democratic Party would again become anathema to moderate voters and Republicans would regain their prominence in the state One reason for this years delays is that a huge wad of liberal legislation including many bills that Davis doesnt want to see on his desk is backed up and Burton could if he wishes dump it on the governor and make him decide whether to offend business or Democratic interest groups It is therefore a game of chicken Will Burton protect Davis from being caught in the middle by holding up the key bills andor agreeing to modifications or will he let the governor sweat CalISO Violating Fed Law By Making Utils Buy State Pwr Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This item was first published late Friday By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California s grid operator may be in violation of federal regulations by forcing utilities to buy expensive power the state secured under long and shortterm contracts in place of electricity that is available from their own lowcost power plants The California Independent System Operator the agency that operates the realtime electricity market and maintains reliability of the grid in the state has given priority during the past three months to power the state Department of Water Resources locked in under the billion of longterm contracts before utilizing electricity from lowcost power plants according to several executives at the agency Greg Fishman an ISO spokesman said there are times this doesnt happen much when because of varying ramp rates we take a bid out of sequence meaning when one plant has a bid of lets say a megawatthour and another has a bid we may take the bid because it would take longer to deliver the power Fishman said the market is not working as it is designed to Since the demise of the California Power Exchange we the industry have been forced to make the market function given the tools that we have Fishman said The PX was a major portion of the market Without it we are left trying to put the market back into shape given the current players in the market However the ISOs federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive electricity to generators and retail customers The ISO shall dispatch generating unitsto meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices reads a section of the rules approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO shall not discriminate between generating units system units loads and system resources other than based on price and the effectiveness location and ramp rate of the resource concerned to respond to the fluctuation in demand or generation Fishman acknowledged that the market is not working as it is designed to but he said the ISO would not respond to specific questions related to the possibility that the agency has violated its federal tariff or other issues related to the operation of the ISO market We are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues he said Agency Fails To Reveal Price Data For DWR Power Moreover the ISO has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the DWR power which is also required under federal regulations Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a trade group representing large and small power producers said there is absolutely no transparency in the ISO market No one knows what theyre paying for The DWR which started buying power in lieu of California s ailing utilities in January signed billion in longterm supply contracts over the past six months at prices that now exceed the spot market price for electricity The DWR at times has had a surplus of electricity and has sold some of it into the spot market at a million loss over the last three months As a result the ISO has ordered the Mohave Generating Station a coalfired power plant in Nevada capable of producing electricity at roughly cents a kilowatthour to reduce output at the facility Fishman said The megawatt Mohave unit is majority owned by Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison Fishman said last week that the ISO is investigating the circumstances that led the grid operator to order the units to ramp down POWER TO THE PEOPLE BLACKOUTS SHED LIGHT ON UPS ADVANTAGE Scott Campbell Computer Reseller News Page Copyright c CMP Media LLC So much for the California power crisis Solution providers spent much of last winter and spring installing uninterruptible power supplies UPSes because of anticipated rolling blackouts But a mild summer on the West Coast put those fears to rest In fact power companies in California even sold excess energy to neighboring states Still heightened awareness of the earlier energy crisis helped solution providers say executives Everybodys got blackout scares Thats where we position ourselves says Henry Ngo marketing manager at eSystems Design a Brea Califbased solution provider We go out to enterpriselevel accounts and we talk about rolling blackouts power surges and the backup power they need Theyre worried about losing data and jeopardizing their whole network infrastructure Although major outages havent occurred recently in California the powerprotection business remains steady In many cases UPSdriven leads have translated into profitable service opportunities Ngo says Selling UPSes gives us a chance to fish for the integration portionmaintenance services design network assessmentfor future projects Ngo says In the past two months eSystems has taken on about UPS deployments in enterprise accounts he says Sources at the Energy Information Administration say demand for electricity is expected to increase percent nationwide this year over last while generating capability will increase only percent In California energy consumption is expected to increase percent this year according to the government agency While other regions dont face the same problems as California solution providers see plenty of opportunity to deliver UPS solutions across the United States The combination of daily thunderstorms old buildings and Louisiana heat and humidity led Software Stuff to include UPS solutions in every recent project says Gary Shurman president of the Metairie Labased solution provider We do a lot of accounting software solutions and we wont install a network without a UPS on every server workstation hub and router says Shurman When we get a severe thunderstorm roll through here many times power will be out from a few minutes to a few hours You really get some equipment damage from that Implementing UPS solutions up front reduces Software Stuffs maintenance and warranty costs Shurman says You dont have to make service calls or replace equipment because of intermittent failures he says Adds Chris Boaglio senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems a Costa Mesa Califbased UPS vendor The power issue will be on the minds of solution providers and customers for the next six months to a year In some instances a UPS is considered a necessary peripheral Most customers need backup that is failsafe but the pain level is not there to spend money While customers arent clamoring for power protection now as they were when the California outages were at the top of the news theres still money to be made says Joe Wolf president of CompuSystems a Washington Mobased solution provider We have seen a lot of thunderstorms in our area and weve replaced more than modems in the last three weeks Wolf says But we still have to keep up the fight Its an ongoing thing You need to remind the customers every single time CompuSystems doesnt include UPS solutions when bidding projects he says but it reminds customers before any contracts are signed how important power protection can be for their business systems Meanwhile UPS vendors are using Web seminars and other training methods to ensure that solution providers can deliver an effective message about UPSes to end users Were working hard to make sure solution providers are armed with tools to help their customers whether theyre dealing with an existing powerprotection solution or the end user doesnt have anything at all says John Donovan director of reseller strategy at American Power Conversion West Kingston RI Businesses in the United States lose about billion annually because of power outages according to a recent report issued by the Electrical Power Research Institute Such statistics can be used to sell UPS solutions say solution providers Even in a small business the first time you have an outage you could put employees out of business for a day That could cost you up to plus lost sales Compare that loss to the cost of an inexpensive battery says Software Stuffs Shurman But end users are growing accustomed to having UPSes installed in new networks he says Its usually pretty painless with a new sale For existing customers that dont have UPSes we go in with powermeasuring equipment and prove to them whats happening with their power says Shurman When you show them what the spikes and drops look like for a hour period they get the picture But without that UPSes can be a hard sell he says The customer would call an electrician who would use a meter reader and say youve got volts so youre fine The global UPS market is expected to generate billion in sales this year and will see a compounded annual growth rate of percent between and says Farah Saeed an industry analyst with Frost and Sullivan In and we saw doubledigit growth but the sluggish economy and pricing pressure are factors in the market now Saeed says Its a very mature market and theres a lot of competition with inexpensive products coming from abroad The median price of a voltampere desktop UPS has fallen percent in the past year says Dave Slotten director of product management at Tripp Lite a Chicagobased UPS vendor For well under youre picking up a fine UPS for desktop protection with serial or USB connectivity Slotten says Theres no excuse not to have one The payback on them is so obvious Margins on UPS products have decreased along with margins on other hardware products but powerprotection equipment brings in supplemental revenue from service opportunities says eSystems Ngo UPS sales growth in the enterprise has been tempered by the slowdown in data center expansion Fewer new data centers translates into fewer UPSes sold and deployed in that space But UPS vendors remain bullish on longterm opportunities that may arise from powerrelated issues In California fundamental fixes arent in place Slotten says Theres still a trend to consume more and more power Then youve got the Bush administration talking about building more power plants but thats a decade off Smaller Lighter Faster Its been said that good things come in small packages Well it seems that folks in the UPS business are warming up to the old adage For a while the UPS earned itself a reputation as the PCs ball and chaina clunky addon that always seemed to get in the way But thanks to technology advances powerprotection systems are becoming lighter more compact and less expensive say vendor executives One thing thats been a hindrance in the UPS market is the size and weight of the products because of transformers and batteries says Chris Boaglio senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems a Costa Mesa Califbased UPS manufacturer Transformers are extremely heavy components that add shipping costs and size to a product But some newer UPSes weigh up to percent less than their predecessors and dont compromise on reliability says Boaglio The combination of market maturation and new technology is appealing to end users says Henry Ngo marketing manager at eSystems Design Brea Calif Products are getting better and smaller and you can do more with less investment he says The two dominant UPS platforms today are online and lineinteractive Online productsthe newer and more expensive of the tworun continuously off a charging battery to provide clean consistent

pricing goes down they say Its like getting a Cadillac at a Chevy price says Dave Slotten director of product management at Chicagobased Tripp Lite Online UPSes regenerate perfect power for computing equipment not the spikes and dips that sometimes plague other powerprotection systems he says Spurring demand is the fact that UPS prices have fallen more than percent in the past year says Gary Shurman president of Software Stuff Metairie La Also the boom in networking and storage solutions has led to the penetration of UPSes beyond desktops and servers say solution providers Network surge

Refund Claims By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This article was originally published Friday WASHINGTON Dow Jones An expedited Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative hearing on claims for billion in refunds on electricity sales in the Pacific Northwest concluded Thursday after three days of legal wrangling The proceeding which FERC spun off from a highprofile controversial case involving California s powerrefund claims poses a legal and logistical hornets nest for the commission according to attorneys involved Power sellers subject to a possible FERC refund order themselves potentially could seek refunds for power they purchased in the region Untold billions of dollars of these socalled ripple refund claims were held in abeyance by the FERC administrative law judge presiding in the case But if FERC orders refunds these power sellers have reserved the right to seek refunds which in some cases could amount to more than they ultimately owe But thats a longterm issue More immediate is the power sellers constitutional dueprocess concerns about the expedited proceeding which allowed limited evidence and crossexamination of witnesses Then theres the problem of defining what is a spotmarket sale in what is largely a bilateral contracts market Various refund claims address not only sales of hours duration but monthlong blocks and in some cases longer than a year Meanwhile municipal utility sellers technically not subject to FERC regulatory jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act are challenging the commissions assertion of authority to order them to make refunds Municipal utilities make up roughly half of the Pacific Northwest market And finally the case has turned into a second bite of the apple for California in its effort to obtain refunds Roughly billion of the total claims is being sought by California with the remainder representing claims from a handful of municipal utilities in the region according to attorneys involved in the proceeding Of California s total claim more than million is sought from Powerex the US marketing arm of British Columbia Hydro a provincially owned utility for sales under contracts with the California Department of Water Resources this year I think its completely outrageous that California s asking for money said an attorney involved in the case We wouldnt be here if they hadnt screwed this thing up in the first place Most parties in the proceeding have asked the judge to throw out California s claims another attorney noted Five Municipal Northwest Utilities Seeking Refunds Only five municipal utilities in the Northwest are seeking refunds Seattle Wash million Tacoma Wash million Clark Wash Public Utilities million Eugene Ore Water Electric Board million the Port of Seattle Wash million and Northern Wasco County Ore Peoples Utility District million The vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds but only a minority are seeking refunds said one attorney in the case among a handful contacted by Dow Jones Newswires who spoke freely on condition they not be identified Weve made clear if refunds are awarded we are going to come in and demand ours as well said an attorney representing a power marketer When the agency sees that it will be clear that they have opened a can of worms that they dont want to get into With the expedited hearing concluded parties in the proceeding must file position briefs by Sept with the administrative law judge hearing the case who is scheduled to forward her proposed findings of fact to the commission by Sept Jeff Goltz an attorney with the Washington state attorney generals office described the power sellers concerns about due process as misplaced Power sellers were concerned that the fate of billions of dollars hinged on a proceeding lasting a few days Goltz said But the proceeding actually was a vehicle to decide if FERC will proceed to a larger welldefined proceeding he said I wouldnt expect the FERC to take this and issue a refund decision Goltz said Attorneys representing power providers expressed the hope that FERC wont pursue refunds in the region We could get a refund said an attorney representing an investorowned utility in the region But our hope is the whole thing goes away which it should he said The whole things just too complicated I dont know how the judge is going to make a decision in this case The case represents a Pandoras box for the commission said an attorney representing a municipal utility in the region opposed to refunds This case has the potential to be far bigger than the California refund case because it involves essentially the entire Western United States the lawyer said If FERC pulls the strings and orders refunds it will trigger ripple refund claims involving hundreds of thousands of bilateral wholesale power sales contracts throughout the West he said Where it stops nobody knows If you start trying to unravel this market for the period in question December through June its not going to end for the foreseeable future said another attorney Each successive ripple will trigger more ripples If they do its going to keep the rest of us attorneys employed for a long time he said The only beneficiaries so far in this proceeding are the attorneys said another lawyer Any refunds are likely to much less than the attorney fees Report LA power agency made big profit during energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved LOS ANGELES AP During the peak of the states power crisis the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged it was reported Monday DWP officials have insisted for months that the agency sold power for just percent above its costs In fact the DWPs profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged percent last year according to a newly completed audit obtained by the Los Angeles Times under the California Public Records Act The finding will likely reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes The audit may also undercut efforts by Gov Gray Davis and others to blame rising energy costs on private outofstate generating companies The audit was ordered in May by the DWPs new general manager David Wiggs It was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and targeted a month period beginning in May The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from private generators contracting and wholesale prices skyrocketing The DWP which had opted out of deregulation cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market helping to avert even more blackouts At the same time though the DWP and other publicly owned utilities charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports later showed Records show that during the worst months of the crisis ending in May the DWP profited million on sales of million the Times said The agency says it is still owed million In an interview with the Times last week former DWP chief S David Freeman who now heads Davis new statewide power authority insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than percent Freeman made the same assurance in July in a letter to US senators probing the energy meltdown He told the Times he has not seen the audit but said if profits were higher than percent then Im not embarrassed about it It says nothing more than theres enterprise at the DWP Wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy during Freemans tenure but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive We charged just and reasonable rates Wiggs told the Times adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin But for consumersrights activists the findings were new ammunition Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said Harry Snyder senior advocate for Consumers Union the nonprofit that publishes Consumer Reports This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companies not a public agency Natural Gas Bills Will Decrease for California Utility Customers Bruce Spence KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Record Stockton California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM PGE residential customers will see this months natural gas bills drop on average by nearly a third from a year ago when supplies were short and market prices were zooming Supplies are up and prices are down now because drillers went at it last winter trying to take advantage of high market prices After a January price spike prices have since declined nearly to the level of two winters ago said Christy Dennis Pacific Gas Electric spokeswoman Although there was such a shortage of natural gas last winter that there were threats of service cuts supplies for this winter should be ample she said We are in much better shape this year than we were last year Dennis said The naturalgas industry reports that falling prices promise to push some drillers out of the market again But if youre talking about this winter its a sunny picture said Laurie Cramer spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association in Washington DC Production is up even if prices are down Perhaps most important she added We dont expect the kind of volatile market we had last year From August gas prices rose from less than per thousand cubic feet to by the beginning of this and have since fallen to under Dennis said that in September the average PGE residential natural gas customer using therms of gas during a day cycle paid for the natural gas portion of the gas bill This month that same therms will cost a nearly percent drop from a year ago she said The big question of course is the outlook for the heart of winter The utility isnt speculating because demand and thus supplies can be unsettled by an unusually cold winter But the gas market trend points to only a slight increase from now through the heavy cold months as naturalgas consumption rises Dennis said In January residential customers use about therms of gas In January the bill for that was about Last January averaged Dennis said Elizabeth Field has both a gas stove and water heater in her Stockton home and she said she was delighted to hear that her gas bill should be down from last winter My natural gas bill doubled over the winter she said Between gasoline prices for the car and my PGE bill it was a big deal Sam Baygi owner of El Dorado Florist N El Dorado St said that higher gas prices didnt really seem to hit him hard over the winter The important factor at his shop is to keep the flowers cool anyway And at home his gas costs seemed up maybe slightly he recalled but all in all he didnt feel pounded I dont think it was so big of a deal Dennis said supplies should be sufficient for PGEs million natural gas customers despite that many of the usual suppliers quit doing business with PGE because of the utilitys bankruptcy proceedings and credit poundinge The utilitys financial woes began last summer when spotmarket spikes for electricity produced high power prices that PGE had to pay to try to keep the power on in California The national naturalgas association is three weeks away from finishing its tabulation of production numbers and forecasting winter supplies But Cramer said naturalgas producers still face many of the same challenges they faced last year such as a shortage of workers and equipment Also some of the biggest discovered naturalgas reserves in the Rocky Mountains region and in the Gulf of Mexico remain untapped because of government restrictions Theres still a lot offlimits to producers Cramer said Also about twothirds of drillers are small momandpop type operations that can be driven out of production by low prices

at its Utah Hunter power plant The outage which forced Scottish Power to buy power on western US wholesale markets overheated by the California energy crisis contributed to million in excesspower costs the company reported for its latest fiscal year which ended March In an effort to avoid exposing itself anew to unprecedented price spikes which were forecast to continue through the end of Scottish Power overcompensated in its forward contracts leading to the new million charge the company said All we are doing is making sure PacifiCorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations Chief Executive Ian Russell said Monday The difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations we were buying at a price that is over ten times what it is today A combination of lower demand more capacity price caps and coolerthanexpected summer weather have led to a collapse in US prices to around per megawatthour currently from an average of more than per megawatthour in the first quarter the company said Scottish Power will seek recovery of the excess charges from US regulators in the months to come Mr Russell said The company is also reviewing its riskmanagement policies The new charges draw a line under the episode that started last winter with this spike in prices Mr Russell said ABN Amro analyst Alistair Buchanan said market was shocked by the announcement and that investors will want to know why they werent warned earlier On the brighter side Mr Russell and Chief Financial Officer David Nish noted that the company last week won a million revenue increase from regulators in the state of Oregon most of which is related to increased power costs Although the tariff increase was only of the million the company was seeking Mr Nish said the company was encouraged by the regulators agreement to allow PacifiCorp to defer compliance with the new Oregon baseline power cost in tariffs until May The agreement also allows PacifiCorp to propose a permanent powercost recovery mechanism he added The company is expecting a decision from Utah regulators on a separate million tariffincrease request in the next couple of days The Oregon rate decision is a positive one for Scottish Power analysts said but several said it will be overshadowed by the million charge which is far higher than the million in excess costs some were expecting this year The most important thing is that the time at which they said they will get acceptable rates of interest from this business PacifiCorp hasnt changed said Gareth LewisDavies utilities analyst at Lehman Brothers in London Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved Calif DWR Hasnt Received Any Invoice From ISO For Power Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Friday By Mark Golden Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow Jones The California Department of Water Resources has never received an invoice from the California Independent System Operator for power purchased on behalf of the states insolvent utilities DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Friday Between the middle of January when Gov Gray Davis ordered the DWR to start paying for ISO power purchases and May the ISO has procured about billion in power on behalf of California s cashstrapped utilities PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison Internationals EIX Southern California Edison according to the ISO None of that power has been paid for according to the ISO as previously reported The ISO and DWR have been negotiating the procedure for settling the accounts but sellers to the ISO have been complaining that it shouldnt take eight months for the state agencies to get payments flowing Until we get a bill that we can account for we cant write a blank check and send it out We havent even received an improper bill said Hidalgo The ISO was unable to comment immediately on whether it has sent a bill to the DWR for power purchased on behalf of the utilities The ISO has said previously that it cant supply all the information the DWR wants without violating its own confidentiality rules The Independent Energy Producers Association which represents many of the suppliers to the ISO said this week the ISO market is on the verge of collapsing Merchant power companies in California such as Dynegy Inc DYN and Mirant Corp MIR continue to sell to the ISO as ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO which has ultimate responsibility for avoiding blackouts ensures there is exactly the right amount of power on the states transmission lines to meet demand at all times which requires constant buying and selling of electricity In midJanuary after the states two main utilities ran out of cash an executive order from Davis backed by state law passed in February authorized the DWR to pay for any purchases the ISO needed to make for the utilities There is no bill I dont know as a government agency how the process of payment for a significant amount of money over billion would be in anybodys mind as a possibility Hidalgo said The DWR which has paid more than billion for power it has bought from suppliers directly since January has set aside money to pay for the ISOs lastminute purchases The ISO considers the entire billion unpaid though DWR operations chief Pete Garris said earlier this week that DWR may have paid a majority of that bill directly to power suppliers The DWR has set aside about billion to pay suppliers once it receives a detailed bill from the ISO that meets DWR requirements Other procedural problems have prevented the DWR from making payment The DWR wants to pay suppliers directly which Garris said the ISO is uncomfortable with The ISO declined to discuss this directpayment issue ISO market rules require that buyers pay the ISO which in turn pays sellers The FERC has ordered the ISO to stop buying power on behalf on parties that arent creditworthy specifically Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison PGE has said that it continues to receive bills from the ISO and has been told the bills are for informational purposes only By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Shocking facts about deregulation Linda McQuaig National Post National Page C c National Post All Rights Reserved Among the many things one might want to do in the privacy of ones own home late at night checking out electricity prices may not be high on the list Yet oddly enough this appears to be one of the main selling features of the Harris governments plan to deregulate the Ontario electricity market next year Once electricity is deregulated the price of a kilowatt of energy will change by the minute with prices posted on the Internet every hour Really keen consumers who dont want to wait a whole agonizing hour can have meters installed right in their homes So for instance if the price per kilowatt hour hits rock bottom at am these wellequipped folk wont have to wait until the top of the hour to shove the laundry into the washing machine turn on the dishwasher and get out the vacuum cleaner This is all part of what deregulation enthusiasts like John Grant an economist who has been involved in the provincial deregulation plans see as the empowerment consumers will enjoy under deregulation Well I certainly wouldnt want to underestimate the pleasure of being able to select the perfect time to maximize ones electricity consumption but will it be enough to compensate for the higher prices that will almost certainly accompany this deregulation We know deregulation produced dramatically higher electricity prices in Alberta and California In Alberta prices rose to five times previous levels last winter in California power costs surged at times to levels above normal Supporters of deregulation prefer to look at what has happened elsewhere Michael Trebilcock a University of Toronto law professor and longtime pusher of electricity deregulation points to deregulation in Australia and the UK where he says electricity prices fell by to Maybe Im missing something here but it sounds like what were faced with is a bestcase scenario under which deregulation saves us possibly to off our power bills Wow The worstcase scenario however involves us paying amounts that are potentially staggering If we do things as badly as California we could see increases from time to time in the range Vacuuming could become not only an exclusively latenight pleasure but a luxury we can only dream of Dont the odds seem to be stacked against us on this one It seems a bit like agreeing to a coin toss Heads you win cents tails you lose But lets go for it And in case it sounds like Im distorting things it should be noted that this is essentially the picture presented by advocates of deregulation Trebilcock for instance doesnt argue that the savings will be big only that there may be some savings as there were in Australia and the UK In a recent presentation to the Institute for Policy Analysis in Toronto Trebilcock acknowledged that the adverse experiences in jurisdictions like California and Alberta made him nervous But in any event he wasnt sure it was possible at this stage in Ontario to put the genie back in the bottle Hows that for a ringing endorsement from one of deregulations leading proponents Meanwhile Myron Gordon a professor of finance at U of Ts Rotman School of Management argues that the Ontario deregulation will be a complete disaster not just for consumers but for the Canadian business community Gordon insists that surging unpredictable electricity costs will strip Ontario industries of the competitive advantage theyve long enjoyed over their counterparts in neighbouring US states Gordon scoffs at the notion that there might be price savings He notes that once our electricity is deregulated it will be subject to the rules of NAFTA Under NAFTA we cant withhold energy supplies from US customers or charge them more than we charge ourselves so electricity shortages in the United States will push our prices here up to US levels Better do the vacuuming now What makes all this infuriating is that Gordon insists that if we just left things as they are with a regulated price in a regulated market we could keep our prices below the United States while covering the full cost of generating the electricity we need and having some supply left over for profitable export This is pretty much what BC has opted to do Its not surprising then that deregulation aficionados are pushing things other than price savings to get the public excited about this bold venture into the new economy John Grant likes to emphasize the huge array of consumer choice that lies ahead Consumers will be able to choose electricity packages that also include long distance telephone and Internet service theyll be free to choose between Standard Supply where the wholesale price of energy will be passed through to them and they may be entitled to a rebate or instead opt for whatever deal is offered by their distributor Or they can choose to deal directly with a retailer who offers fixed prices for a year or more or another who will install a meter in their home so they can track minutebyminute price fluctuations Not that life will be problemfree in this consumer nirvana Grant poses the question If consumers sign up to a retailers fixed price offer and sign away their right to a possible rebate do they know what they have given up Clearly lots to talk about around the water cooler or over a cold beer after work Its hard to imagine what people did late at night before there was a new economy Commentary Bailout Scheme for Edison Fails Tests Again WILLIAM BRADLEY Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page B Copyright The Times Mirror Company At a late night session Thursday the California Assembly emulated its deregulation forebears narrowly adopting another complex halfunderstood energy bill from the back rooms There are many problems with the proposed state bailout of Southern California Edison Here are the most fundamental The bailout is much bigger than advertised Backers including Gov Gray Davis parent company Edison International and some Los Angeles progressives advertise it as a billion deal In reality when interest on bonds and other benefits are added in it will cost closer to twice as much Tangible assets for the public once central to the deal have been stripped from it The Edison rescue was to center on the states acquisition of the utilitys transmission lines Ownership of the grid would have given the state leverage it has lacked over power generators and state ownership would make critically needed upgrades cheaper to finance This fell away when Pacific Gas Electric declared bankruptcy this spring taking a huge chunk of the private grid off the market While some Sierra lands receive protection from development the state gains no ownership Coastal and desert lands are unprotected Edison already has received three state bailouts First it along with the other big private utilities received billions in a bailout of stranded assets most notably nuclear that was part of the deregulation deal It received billions more as part of the abovemarket consumer rates locked in by the deregulation dealuntil companies that bought the power plants Edison cleverly sold them turned the screws last year These funds enabled Edison International to run a highflying global merchant power operation Then Edison received a third bailout earlier this year when the state spent billion to replace power lost from the troubled San Onofre nuclear plant Edison is hypocritical in coming to the Capitol with its hand out yet again especially given its central role in pushing through the deregulation scheme from which it now wants to be rescued Edison International CEO John E Bryson trades on his past progressive status as a Natural Resources Defense Council cofounder to distract from reality When Gov Pete Wilson signed deregulation into law Bryson called it a great day for us Yet even with the billions Edison has gotten in previous bailouts a state rescue effort might be justified were the process not so remarkably compromised Davis sent Michael R Peevey a former Southern California Edison president to represent the state in negotiations with Edison Not surprisingly this led to a generous deal for the company with the state negotiating for things that the state Public Utilities Commission could have required the company to do anyway Although that deal died what is now on the table is fatally flawed by the sweetheart deal template from which it sprang So eager is Davis to bail out Edison that he would allow big business customers to cut their own private power contracts This could leave the rest of us holding the bag on his hugely expensive longterm power contracts Perhaps worst of all is the tremendous distraction caused by the months of maneuvering to save Edison from its own miscalculations As we emerge from panic mode California has serious problems including a new crazyquilt of state energy agencies and longterm power contracts that perpetrate a green blackout ignoring renewable energy in favor of a new generation of fossil fuel plants The situation would have been far more rational and efficient had everyone involved not had to waste inordinate amounts of time dealing with the special pleadings of one privileged corporation Enough PGE DISPUTES COST SHIFT THE AGENCY THAT BUYS STATE UTILITIES ELECTRICITY HAD ASKED REGULATORS TO APPROVE UNIFORM RATES BUT PLAN IS UNDER REVIEW MIKE TAUGHER TIMES STAFF WRITER Contra Costa Times Walnut Creek CA Final Page a c Copyright Contra Costa Times All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO A plan to shift million in electricity costs from Southern California to Pacific Gas Electric Co came under heavy fire Wednesday when the San Franciscobased utility launched a media campaign to oppose the plan and Northern California lawmakers blasted it as potentially illegal Even if it costs the state more to buy power in the north it is doubtful that the differences are enough to justify such a large transfer of costs according to a letter signed by of the Northern California members of the Assembly At issue is how the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for financially strapped utilities since January will be repaid for its electricity purchases this year and next The agency had asked state regulators to approve a uniform price tag of cents for each kilowatthour it sells to utility customers But under the plan now being considered by the Public Utilities Commission PGE customers would pay cents per kilowatthour through next May while customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric would pay cents and cents respectively This appears to be an unsubstantiated and illegal cost shift to Northern California customers lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to PUC President Loretta Lynch The PUC had planned to consider the issue today but it is among several items that have been delayed for as long as two weeks as the commission struggles to issue regulations needed to allow the state to borrow more than billion on the bond market Lynch said linking the price of electricity to the actual cost to the state of providing it instead of spreading out the toll that the electricity crisis has exacted on California equally is consistent with the way the commission has traditionally imposed rates That is the methodology the commission has used for decades Lynch said It would be discriminatory to have Edison customers and SDGE customers subsidize PGE customers Still Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg said that unless the plan is modified Northern California lawmakers might block legislation designed to keep SoCal Edison out of bankruptcy That legislation which could come to the Assembly floor as early as today has been a key part of Gov Gray Davis strategy to navigate California out of the electricity crisis I dont know how anyone in the north is going to be able to justify voting for a bailout for Edison that shifts any of these costs onto PGE customers directly or indirectly Canciamilla said According to Canciamilla relieving SoCal Edison of hundreds of millions of costs for statepurchased power could help the Southern California utility finance billion in debts to generators which in turn would help make the bailout plan work I dont think the real motivation is retribution against PGE for defying Davis by declaring voluntary bankruptcy in April as much as it is trying to figure out a way to assist in making a bailout of SoCal Edison work Canciamilla said Meanwhile PGE took out radio spots and ads in three newspapers Wednesday urging customers to complain to the PUC about the plan The commission substantially changed the formula and as a result our customers would be forced to pay more said PGE spokesman Ron Low That claim is mostly true but potentially misleading PGEs customers would pay more for the electricity purchased by the state but whether that would lead to a higher overall electricity bill is not clear That is because the PUC has yet to determine how much PGE should earn on electricity generated at the plants it still owns If PGE is allowed to earn relatively little then no rate increase would be needed But if the sum of the rate collected by DWR and the rate collected by PGE exceeds what customers are paying now then another rate hike could occur The PUCs Lynch who assured reporters this spring that no rate hikes would be needed after the commission approved increases totaling cents per kilowatthour this year was noncommittal Wednesday about the possibility of a further increase for PGE customers Paul Clanon head of the PUCs energy division said the likelihood of a rate increase for PGE customers would become clearer near the end of the month when drafts begin circulating to address the rate that PGE may collect PUC officials did say however that no rate hike would hit customers of Southern California utilities State officials say it costs far more to provide power in the north because the state has to buy more electricity to serve Northern California and there is comparatively less electricity available in the northern part of state and in the Pacific Northwest That pinch between supply and demand is exacerbated by transmission constraints that make it more difficult to bring electricity up from Southern California according to DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo The state supplies about percent of the electricity used by PGE customers with the rest being generated at PGE plants or under existing contracts especially with alternative energy generators CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SEEKS PROBE OF POWER CUTBACK Bloomberg News The Arizona Republic Final Chaser Page D Copyright c The Arizona Republic California Secretary of State Bill Jones plans to ask federal regulators to investigate allegations that officials colluded to reduce output at a power plant to save the state money on energy trading Jones plans to seek the Republican nomination to challenge Gov Gray Davis in next years gubernatorial campaign He will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to start an investigation said Beth Pendexter a spokeswoman for Jones The probe would focus on why a state agency may have ordered Edison Internationals utility to reduce output at a plant in Nevada The state Department of Water Resources would be a target of the investigation Pendexter said The department may have sought to slow production at the Mojave power plant she said Because the state buys power at higher prices in longterm contracts it loses money when it has to sell electricity cheaply during a time of excess supply The Department of Water Resources has spent almost billion buying electricity for PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edisons Southern California Edison which are insolvent after running up billions in debts under the states deregulation law The department has signed about billion in longterm energy contracts The State Davis Upbeat on Billion Edison Plan Energy Governor is optimistic that Senate Assembly versions can be reconciled and a bill sent to him next week before session ends MIGUEL BUSTILLO NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis expressed optimism Friday that a billion plan to try to restore Southern California Edison to financial health will reach his desk before next Friday when legislators adjourn for the year A day after the state Assembly narrowly approved the measure the Democratic governor said that although it still needs to be reconciled with a slightly different version approved earlier by the Senate he is confident the bill will clear the Legislature Im hopeful that we get the rescue plan ratified by a week from today the last day of the session Davis said Friday during a breakfast meeting in Sacramento I think thats entirely doable now since its passed both houses albeit in different forms Our goal will be to get that done before the Legislature recesses Davis optimism contrasted with angry words from consumer activists who oppose the bill as a bailout of Edison Is this the best deal the Assembly can get from a company that claims to be desperately in need of help said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco It reads as if the same scoundrels that led the Legislature into deregulationthe utilities and the large commercial customersare still running the show Edison executives offered a subdued response during a conference call with investors Friday maintaining that the road to restoring the companys finances in the Capitol remains long This is another step in the trail said Theodore Craver Jr chief financial officer of Edison International parent company of the Rosemeadbased utility We obviously have a long way to go yet in terms of additional steps at the Senate but its good to see some momentum there The bill SB xx by Sen Richard Polanco DLos Angeles is a slimmeddown version of a rescue deal Davis reached with the debtstrapped utility this spring to keep it out of bankruptcy It has cleared both houses but still needs final approval in the Senate where Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco plans to take several days to review the changes made in the Assembly to determine whether the measure is viable In many ways the two versions are alike Both would allow the utility to float bonds that would be used to repay about threefourths of the billion debt Edison incurred purchasing electricity during the early days of the energy crisis Edison bought the power on the volatile open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a stateimposed rate freeze Edison would be permitted to use the money to pay back most of its creditorsbanks and small alternative energy producers Both bills would bar Edison from using the money to repay large energy companies which Democratic legislators accuse of gouging the state during the crisis The utility would be on its own to pay or negotiate the billion it owes those companies Under the Assembly version the bonds would be paid off by about of Edisons large and midsized business customers those that use kilowatts and up Under the Senate version a smaller number of the largest businesses would foot the tab Under both bills residential customers and most small businesses would be spared Supporters of the bill say that neither version would require an additional increase in electricity bills Opponents question that assertion Because the company would still have sizable debts even if the bill passes Edison representatives say they cannot guarantee they will not wind up in bankruptcy Robert Foster Edison Internationals executive vice president of external affairs told investors Friday that the bill still leaves Southern California Edison at risk Nevertheless we are encouraged by the progress made by the Assembly toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness Foster said In both plans Edison would also agree not to pursue a series of lawsuits and legal claims against the state Pacific Gas Electric the states largest utility has filed suit against the state charging that the rate freeze illegally prohibited the company from recovering its costs of providing power to customers Both bills also would give the state conservation rights to acres of mostly wilderness land near Edisons hydroelectric power reservoirs The original rescue deal from last spring hinged on the state purchasing Edisons power grid Some legislators and consumer activists said the grid could be upgraded with public financing to improve the distribution of power and prevent the likelihood of blackouts But legislators have questioned the value of owning a third of the states power linesthe share controlled by Edisonand the bills minimize the grid acquisition Under the Senate plan the state would have an option to purchase the lines at billion or book value less than half what Davis initially proposed The Assembly plan would give the state a similar option requiring further action by the Legislature before it could be exercised The Assembly bill would pay the utility twice book value or fair market price whichever was lower The Assembly and Senate versions contain provisions that would allow businesses to pursue direct access contracts to buy electricity from energy companies instead of from the utility Participating businesses would have to pay an exit fee of sorts to cover their share of the utilitys debt bonds Power Politics in the Senate The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company This has not been a good year for clear thinking about energy First came the CheneyBush national energy strategy which presupposed that the country was in the grips of a terrible energy shortage and that the only sure way to address it was to drill aggressively for more oil and gas remove various regulatory impediments to the burning of coal and build new power plants The House of Representatives swallowed the CheneyBush scenario whole and produced an alarmingly unbalanced energy bill with billion in tax breaks billion for traditional energy producers only billion for conservation The Senate must now set things right presumably at lower cost even the Bush administration was appalled by the Houses price tag What this country wants is an energy policy that encourages oil and gas exploration without corrupting the environment finds more efficient ways to use the energy we have and begins planning for the day when the fossil fuels we take for granted are less abundant at home or abroad This will not be an easy task energy politics gets nasty and local in a hurry In the House for example many normally reliable friends of the environment voted in favor of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the oil companies and against increasing fuel economy standards because they were terrified of retaliation from organized labor if they did otherwise This is a rare chance for the Senate to exercise statesmanship while reaping political rewards as well Polls show that the two issues on which President Bush is most vulnerable are energy and the environment The Senate cannot lose if it produces a plan more balanced and enlightened than his It will be up to Jeff Bingaman the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to devise such a plan Then Tom Daschle the Senate majority leader must sell it to his colleagues There are three areas where the House bill requires complete overhaul Improving Efficiency The House bill dedicates billion in various subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy versus about billion for the coal oil and gas industries It creates modest tax credits for people who buy hybrid cars for builders of more energyefficient homes and for manufacturers of some energysaving appliances But it does nothing to improve the efficiency of one of the biggest energy users of all airconditioners and it is here that the Senate could usefully resurrect the tough standards imposed by the Clinton administration that President Bush is trying to roll back The most important and courageous step however and one the House refused to take would be to close the socalled SUV loophole under which large vehicles like sport utility vehicles and minivans are classified as light trucks and thus escape the milepergallon standard required of ordinary cars Closing that loophole which Detroit is perfectly capable of doing would result in oil savings of one million barrels a day by more than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could be expected to yield in the same time frame Increasing Supply At the heart of the House bill is a proposal to open up the refuges coastal plain to oil exploration That would yield only six months to a years worth of oil even at favorable prices while disrupting an ecological treasure Industry assertions that drilling would create new jobs have been widely discredited There are other steps the committee can take to increase supply One is to see whether there is an environmentally safe way of tapping and transporting the vast supplies of natural gas at Alaskas Prudhoe Bay where the oil industry is already firmly ensconced Such a scheme would be expensive and in some quarters controversial but it makes a lot more sense than invading the refuge the national forests the Rocky Mountain Front and other sensitive areas on which the oil industry and the Cheney task force have cast a covetous eye Improving Reliability The House was so fixated on subsidizing traditional energy producers including the coalfired utilities that it paid no attention to the way electricity is regulated and transported That was a huge oversight that Mr Bingaman says he intends to remedy As the nowreceding California crisis demonstrated electricity deregulation has not gone smoothly There are transmission problems in the West and Northeast Power does not move easily from one region to another and the system is full of disincentives that discourage smaller and potentially more efficient producers of power from entering the market None of this will come easy for Mr Bingaman and Mr Daschle They must resist President Bushs seductive and specious argument that opening up new areas for oil and gas drilling and easing environmental regulations will provide an immediate economic boost And powerful corporate and labor forces are arrayed against them But the nation would like them to give it their best shot A SelfInflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over Enron By ALEX BERENSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SOMETHING is rotten with the state of Enron Or so Wall Street suspects On Jan shares in Enron the giant energy trading company in Houston stood at On Friday Enron closed at down percent for the week and percent for the year The slide has destroyed more than billion in shareholder value In part the companys problems are beyond its control a result of the collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming glut in electricity But the deepest wound at Enron is selfinflicted Heavy insider selling indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap between the company and Wall Street The stock is trading under a cloud says James S Chanos the president of Kynikos Associates a hedge fund in New York Mr Chanos began betting against Enron early this year and says he thinks that the companys shares remain overvalued Enrons problems came to a head on Aug when it announced that Jeffrey K Skilling the chief executive had quit for personal reasons With his resignation Mr Skilling joined a halfdozen other top Enron managers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities Still the news came as a surprise because Mr Skilling was named to his post only in February Under the best of circumstances the unexpected departure of a chief executive rattles Wall Street But hardheaded investors can usually comfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearly departed poohbah has left behind Executives come and go but numbers are forever Unfortunately Enrons books offer investors little succor The complexity of the companys businesses and the way it reports its results make understanding Enrons financial statements essentially impossible Over the last decade Enron has transformed itself from a simple natural gas pipeline company into the worlds largest trader of electricity and gas Last year about threequarters of the companys cash flow came out of the companys wholesale services division which includes its trading operations But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes Are they shortterm or longterm Is the company hedged or does it make directional bets on the prices of the commodities it trades The answers are crucial because they determine how much risk Enron has taken to make its money Big profits are nice Big profits that come from big risky trades are a recipe for big unexpected writeoffs Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely related companies in related party transactions The company says that the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that they have been approved by its board and outside auditors But relatedparty deals can provide a convenient way for public companies to shift losses to private affiliates And Enrons disclosure about its relatedparty deals including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a partnership that until recently was controlled by the companys chief financial officer is notably sketchy In the good old days like last year companies could get away with the unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks as long as their revenue and profit numbers looked good But Wall Street has become more demanding as Enron is learning to its chagrin Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron says the company is aware of investors concerns Weve got credibility issues on the street no question Mr Palmer says Were looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more information Sooner would be better than later

to the California Power Authority The authority has billions to spend on new power plants that would keep Californians homes from going dark when electricity is scarce Generators have complained that the state hasnt paid them in full for power deliveries and they say pending legislation could make it more difficult to do business in California But financing deals offered by the brand new power authority are too good to pass up Right now its hard to tell if your investment will pay off said Sandy Fruhman spokeswoman for Reliant Going this route seems safe This morning the fivemember power authority will begin discussing proposals to build plants that would be used to bolster electricity reserves The authority is charged with everything from encouraging construction of new power plants to helping lowincome homeowners buy energyefficient refrigerators While critics have called the agency an unnecessary new bureaucracy its five members could have a profound impact on the states energy future They have up to billion to spend and are expected to soon begin signing contracts to provide financing for companies that want to build socalled peaker plants which would be used when electricity supplies are low The authority also will reserve the right to eventually own the plants meaning the states role in energy markets would continue long into the future The goal is to make sure California has a percent energy reserve at all times says S David Freeman chairman of the authority When power is scarce and prices are climbing the authority would provide cheap electricity Well be the WalMart of energy said Freeman who is one of four authority members appointed by Gov Gray Davis The fifth member is state Treasurer Phil Angelides Freeman says encouraging the development of power sources that rely on renewable resources like wind and the sun is one of his top priorities Power plants typically use natural gas to run the turbines that produce electricity Skyrocketing natural gas prices last winter led in part to the surging electricity prices that bankrupted Pacific Gas and Electric Co and plunged the state into crisis The Davis administration has been criticized for shutting out renewable power companies when it signed longterm contracts to buy electricity earlier this year Now Freeman says the power authority could use up to half of its money to fund wind farms solarpowered generators and other plants that rely on renewable sources The renewables are a hedge against natural gas prices he said Companies that have submitted proposals range from EnXco which operates wind farms on the Altamont Pass and in Palm Springs and the Mojave Desert and Yanke Energy a Boise Idaho company that turns wood and other waste from landfills into power Details of their proposals will be released today Freeman said dozens of energy companies including Enron and Reliant had submitted proposals to erect gasfired peaker power plants The state would offer financing for the plants which would be run by the companies Reliant and Enron officials both said their proposals called for their companies to oversee the construction of the plants but the state would own them The plants would be built by next summer Those proposals come amid increasingly heated rhetoric by the group representing power generators Jan SmutnyJones spokesman for the Independent Energy Producers has blasted the state for failing to fully pay companies for energy theyve supplied California He said legislation such as a bill that would limit energy companies profits made countries like Bangladesh or Bulgaria more stable places to invest in PUC vote on directaccess power deals blocked for a week Bernadette Tansey The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page A Copyright A conservative appointee to the state Public Utilities Commission blocked a vote yesterday on banning businesses from cutting private electricity deals with generators saying he wanted to give more firms time to sign up Commissioner Richard Bilas put a oneweek hold on the PUC action to suspend direct access a major element of California s deregulation plan that lets consumers bypass the utilities and shop around for better deals on power Bilas move drew an exasperated response from fellow commissioner Carl Wood who said the delay in approving the ban was letting big companies desert the utilities and sticking small customers with a greater share of the states multibilliondollar power bill Theres a gold rush going on said Wood an opponent of deregulation They clearly are continuing to make these deals Bilas a freemarket advocate appointed to the commission by former Gov Pete Wilson said he held out a slim hope that state lawmakers would order the PUC to salvage the direct access option But barring that he said the oneweek delay could give businesses a final opportunity to lock in cheaper electricity contracts That would be my hope Bilas said As far back as January direct access seemed doomed The state Legislature directed the PUC to suspend the option as a way of keeping the largest number of consumers with the utilities so they could help pay the state for its power purchases Industry groups lobbied hard to preserve direct access but none of the legislative proposals to do that has passed Under the proposal that the PUC put off yesterday direct access contracts would be banned retroactive to July Energy companies say they will challenge any retroactive ban in court That in turn could delay the sale of billion in state bonds to reimburse the treasury for the states power buys The PUC has not estimated how much revenue the state stands to lose if direct access contracts dating to July are allowed to stand In July alone more than businesses signed such deals The commission is now scheduled to take up the issue next Thursday It is also supposed to consider an array of other measures needed before state Treasurer Phil Angelides can complete the state bond offering Those include a proposal that Pacific Gas and Electric Co customers pay million more than Southern California consumers to reimburse the state for its electricity deals Calif Official Asks FERC To Probe ISO DWR Collusion Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This article was originally published Wednesday By Bryan Lee OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON Dow JonesBill Jones California s secretary of state Wednesday asked the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate possible power market manipulation by state agencies In a letter sent Wednesday to FERC Chairman Pat Wood Jones called for the commission to investigate possible significant price and market manipulation of electrical energy by several energyrelated entities in the administration of California s Gov Gray Davis Jones a Republican intends to challenge Davis in next years gubernatorial election Davis administration officials dismissed Joness allegations as politically motivated Specifically Jones wants FERC to determine if the California Independent System Operator whose governing board consists of Davis appointees ordered Southern California Edison Co EIX to reduce its power output in order to lessen financial losses under longterm powersupply contracts entered into by the Department of Water Resources The letter was prompted by an Aug Dow Jones Newswires report that the ISO directed Edison to ramp down its lowcost megawatt Mohave generating station in Nevada at various times in recent months The report cited ISO sources saying the motivation was to prevent the DWR from selling its contracted power supplies at a loss The sole apparent purpose of these output reduction orders has been to diminish California s need to sell surplus power at a loss Jones said in the letter to FERC Such a loss would have a negative public relations impact on the Davis administration he said The Mohave plant produces power around the clock for about per megawatthour as opposed to the abovemarket MWh to MWh the DWR is purchasing electricity for under longterm contracts I am very concerned that the Cal ISO in concert or collusion with the Department of Water Resources is abusing its broad authority over the transmission of electrical power over interstate power lines in order to avoid political embarrassment for the Davis administration Jones wrote This abuse because it involves the interstate transmission of electrical power must be investigated by your agency under the authority granted to you by the Federal Power Act Jones said in the letter to Wood who was unavailable for comment Wednesday For months now competitive power providers have been asking FERC to decide whether the ISO meets the commissions requirements for independent governance given that its board is appointed by Davis and the state is deeply involved in power markets FERC was expected to issue an order in late July acting on the governance issue but the order was stricken from the commissions meeting agenda at the behest of Wood and other commission members according to FERC sources Those sources say they expect the commission to ultimately act on the matter and rule that the politically appointed board runs afoul of FERCs requirement for independence from market participants Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed Joness allegations as ludicrous Its all politics Theres no substance Its completely false to say were in collusion with Cal ISO said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo calling Joness allegations really reaching and without merit But industry officials note that the Mohave plant is a baseload power plant designed to run hours a day and not have its output adjusted in response to daily demand fluctuations Mohave is a plant that should be running all the time said Edison spokesman Steve Conroy ISO spokesman Greg Fishman citing confidentiality rules declined to discuss specific powerdispatch orders involving Mohave But he did suggest that a lack of flexibility among generators could account for the anomalous orders directing the baseload plant to curb output The ISO has complained to FERC that generators are refusing the powergrid operators orders to either ramp up or ramp down plant output as part of the ISOs responsibility to balance supply and demand across the states power system We have not seen the flexibility we like to see in the market said Fishman In certain cases we may need to ask power plants to back down that ordinarily would not be asked he said By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Calif firm says Powerex overcharged BC Hydro export arm says matter already being addressed in a FERC proceeding WENDY STUECK The Globe and Mail Metro Page B All material Copyright c Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc and its licensors All rights reserved VANCOUVER BC Hydros Powerex Corp was accused this week of overcharging one of its California customers by million US The allegations were made during a hearing into power prices that began on Wednesday in Washington DC by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC The hearings set to conclude today are examining claims by electricity customers in the Pacific Northwest including the cities of Seattle and Tacoma that power sellers overcharged them by as much as billion between last December and June Yesterday British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority spokesman Elisha Odowichuk said that representatives for the California Department of Water Resources alleged this week that power sellers in the Pacific Northwest including Powerex the utilitys export sales arm overcharged the agency by about billion between December and June of this year Of those alleged overcharges million was attributed to Powerex Ms Odowichuk said The California Department of Water Resources is a state agency that took over electricity purchasing in January after state utilities fell into debt and were not able to buy power on the spot market CDWRs statements are inappropriate because alleged overcharging in the California market is already being addressed in a separate FERC proceeding she said We believe they alleged overcharges are a separate issue and are already being dealt with she said yesterday Ms Odowichuk said that Powerex was a net power importer during the period in question and that the company believes the allegations against it are unfounded Representatives for the CDWR were attending hearings yesterday and not available for comment Powerex has generated windfall profits over the past few years by selling electricity to outofprovince customers especially California But along with other power sellers it has come under scrutiny for its pricing practices during periods when power prices spiked last year and in the first six months of The state of California maintains it is owed almost billion in refunds from power sellers During failed settlement talks in July between the state and power sellers Powerex offered to reduce the amount it is owed by California purchasing agencies by million That offer along with others from US power sellers was rejected A FERC judge is now studying the California refund issue and is expected to make recommendations to FERC by early November Powerex is owed million by California customers who ran into financial difficulties and were unable to pay their bills when power prices spiked last year The hearing into alleged overcharging in the Pacific Northwest is scheduled to wrap up this week and recommendations to follow this fall California Utilities Protest Plan Giving StateBought Power Priority Energy Proposal could force distribution of moreexpensive electricity purchased by California Department of Water Resources JERRY HIRSCH NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C Copyright The Times Mirror Company California s two largest utilities are protesting a proposed requirement that could force them to distribute power the state has purchased before selling their own lowercost electricity The state Department of Water Resourceswhich started buying electricity on behalf of million Californians when Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison became insolvent earlier this yearis seeking the requirement because it has contracted for more power than is needed PGE said If forced to distribute that surplus power in place of typically lowercost nuclear hydroelectric and other energy from their generating sources PGE and SCE would face added financial hardships and the higher costs eventually might show up in consumer rates the companies said This would not be in the best interest of utility customers Southern California Edison said in a filing with the California Public Utilities Commission The commission will consider whether to adopt the musttake requirement later this month when it sets the terms by which the state will be repaid for its power purchases We believe DWR has a current surplus of highpriced power under contract and therefore is seeking authority from the CPUC to charge our customers for that highpriced power Pacific Gas Electric a unit of PGE Corp of San Francisco said In comments filed at the utilities commission earlier this week Pacific Gas Electric said the rate agreement would be illegal because Assembly Bill Xwhich put the state in the energypurchasing business in Januarydoes not allow customers to be charged for DWR power that is not delivered to them Instead the utility said the law says the DWR may sell surplus power on the open market California entered the power business when a surge in wholesale electricity prices and a regulatory freeze on consumer rates created billions of dollars in losses for the two utilities That eventually pushed Pacific Gas Electric to seek protection from its creditors in Bankruptcy Court SCE a unit of Edison International in Rosemead has avoided following suit but is insolvent and is seeking a financial rescue from the state The proposed rate agreement between DWR and the utilities commission guarantees that the water agency would recover whatever it spends on electricity for PGE and SCE as well as Sempra Energy unit San Diego Gas Electric which is financially healthy but also turned to DWR for power after the states primary power market collapsed in late January PGE said one section of the draft rate agreement would require the utilities commission to order that DWR power be delivered to utility customers whenever the water agency requests even if the DWR power is millions if not billions of dollars more expensive than the utilities own power supplies or power available from third parties The state has signed longterm power contracts totaling billion at rates that average cents to cents a kilowatthour for socalled baseload power or electricity produced by the large power plants that operate most hours of the day PGEs cost of generation for its nuclear power is cents a kilowatthour SCE said cost of the power it generates through its plants averages about cents a kilowatthour At issue is what is called a must take or must deliver clause in the agreement between the two state agencies This would allow the DWR to force any surplus power on the utilities and require them to cut their own generation DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said such surpluses would happen infrequently because the department also has shortterm contracts that can be adjusted to reduce the amount of electricity the state must buy Nevertheless many energy analysts believe that in the states effort to use longterm contracts to lock in prices and tame the volatile wholesale power market California officials purchased too much power and paid too much for it A Los Angeles Times analysis of DWR reports found that surpluses would probably peak in when the state has purchased electricity that amounts to of the needs of the three large investorowned utilities But according to current trends the utilities need the state to supply only about Whether such surpluses are infrequent or become chronic they can prove costly In July the state racked up million in losses after selling excess power for onefifth the price it paid The state has not released data for August Assembly OKs Bill to Rebuild Edisons Finances Energy Lawmakers battle late into the night over the billion package pushed by Gov Davis Foes say the plan which faces hurdles in the Senate is a bailout MIGUEL BUSTILLO Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Despite threats of a ballot backlash the state Assembly late Thursday approved a billion bill to restore Southern California Edison to something close to financial health Passage by a vote almost along party lines came only after the Legislatures Democratic leaders arranged for Democratic Assemblyman Gil Cedillo who had been home in Los Angeles with his ailing wife to fly to Sacramento for a late evening vote The bill must still be reconciled with a different version that passed the Senate in July The bill would allow Edison to float bonds to pay off about threequarters of the massive debt it accumulated during the energy crisis The company would have to find its own way to handle the remaining debt of about billion The bonds would be paid off by the top of the utilitys large and mediumsized business consumers Homeowners and smaller businesses would not be burdened with the cost Gov Gray Davis and other supporters of the bill say the bonds could be paid off without any additional electricity rate increases but foes of the bill have challenged that assertion Even without a rate increase the bill has been bitterly opposed by consumer activists who have labeled it a bailout and have threatened a ballot initiative to reverse it The prospect of running for reelection next year with such an initiative on the ballot has spooked many lawmakers deepening their reluctance to vote for the bill But Edison and Davis have spent weeks lobbying intensely for votes Majority Democrats argued that keeping the utility out of bankruptcy was in the public interest Minority Republicans charged that the bill might not actually keep the utility out of bankruptcy but would certainly place an unfair burden on business Have we lost our minds asked Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox RFair Oaks Has this body lost its sense of direction People outside must be thinking These people must be drinking on the job The Assembly action was by far the most significant step in what has been a controversial sixmonth crusade to rescue the Rosemeadbased utility through government interventiona circuslike process that has flooded the Capitol with lobbyists for every specialinterest group imaginable But the bill SB xx by state Sen Richard Polanco DLos Angeles still faces major obstacles The version that passed the Senate narrowly won approval The Senates Democratic leaders are now concerned that changes made by their counterparts in the lower house have made the measure even more politically unpalatable One indication of the closeness of the vote came shortly before debate began about pm as Cedillo DLos Angeles arrived in the chamber Cedillo had been home with his ill wife but Democratic leaders needing his vote arranged for him to fly back to Sacramento Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco said Thursday that he and his colleagues would need a few days to review the dozens of amendments recently added to the bill He predicted the upper house would probably make changes of its own and send a new version of the bill back to the Assembly for a final vote by Sept the deadline to pass legislation this year Consumer activists vow to continue their efforts to thwart the rescue plan in the Senate This is one of those devastating displays of disregard for constituents needs and consumer needs said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights At the end of the day the people of the state of California are going to have to depend on John Burton and the Senate to stop this obscene giveaway This spring Davis and Edison reached an agreement in principle for a government rescue of the utility The company accumulated its huge debt last year and early this year when it had to buy electricity on the open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a stateimposed rate freeze But the proposal hit the Legislature like a ton of bricks and has struggled ever since With polls showing that the public considered the utilities to be culprits in the energy crisis lawmakers have worried about the political consequences of voting for legislation perceived as a bailout And five years after approving a landmark deregulation of the states electricity market that was widely blamed for the problem lawmakers worried about making another mistake Many lawmakers also wondered whether a utility bankruptcy was as harmful as supporters of the bill contend California s largest utility Pacific Gas Electric Co chose to take itself into bankruptcy in the spring rather than seek a government solution to its problems and the lights did not go dark in Northern California as a result But Davis and other supporters of the bill argued that the states only way out of the power crisis is to have the private utilities regain their financial health That would allow the state to get out of the expensive business of buying power on behalf of the utilities customers Bankruptcy would only further delay the states exit from the power business they argued This bill is complicated Its complicated in my view because the issue is complicated said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek who presented the bill to the lower house But it is in my view the last piece of the puzzle we need to put out this forest fire Since January California has spent billions of taxpayer dollars purchasing electricity to avert blackouts because the utilities were too encumbered with debt to continue supplying customers State leaders hope to leave the power business in Even so the bill traveled a bumpy road in the Assembly Lawmakers took out some elements of the plan to obtain votes in one committee only to put them back in to get it through the next panel And only a surprising Republican vote from Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino allowed the bill to clear the Assemblys energy committee In the end the bill is considerably slimmed down from what Davis and Edison officials first proposed in the spring Under the bill Edison would be permitted to use the money from its bonds to pay off the debt it owes banks and the states small alternative energy producers The company would use its own resources for the remaining billion it owes large energy companies Democratic lawmakers contend those companies engaged in price gouging during the energy crisis and are opposed to giving them all they are owed We have been getting gouged by these guys for a year now and this is our opportunity to give them a haircut said Assemblyman Dario Frommer DLos Angeles They dont get any money from this not one dime Edison representatives say the plan should allow the company to recover financiallybut that it falls short of guaranteeing it would be made whole The State Enron Records to Stay Secret Court A judge orders confidentiality for the power

committee investigating price gouging in California s wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enrons documents in April seeking records of electricity sales bidding strategies prices and outofstate transactions The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records Enron sued July and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C Kobayashi granted the companys request for a protective order The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources which began buying electricity on behalf of the states two largest utilities last January Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff wrote Kobayashi the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict actual conflicts can arise Kobayashis order is a reversal of an earlier tentative ruling in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an unacceptable intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature Karen Denne a spokeswoman for the Houstonbased company described executives as very pleased with the court ruling Turning over the documents was never the issue she said The issue was always protecting our rights Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides Denne said Reliant Energy of Houston another company that resisted demands for business records on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunns committee and will begin bringing documents to a depository in Sacramento said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento but not all are fully complying with subpoenas There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants he said On July the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation The committee which the Senate created in March has focused its investigation

News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES The California Assembly late Thursday passed legislation that would rescue Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy by authorizing the utility to sell billion in bonds to pay off part of its debt Edison which has a market capitalization of about billion has racked up billions of dollars in debt it accumulated from buying power at high prices on the open market because of the California electricity crisis The assembly voted in favor of the measure and secured a vote from an assembly republican The bill needed a minimum of votes for passage During the past six months republicans have voiced opposition to an Edison bailout The legislation which was passed by the State Senate in July and recently amended by the Assembly would allow the unit of Edison International EIX Rosemead Calif to pay off commercial paper holders and small power producers with the bond sale However the utility will still need to raise about billion to pay large generators The Assembly debated the bill for about two hours Thursday evening and attempted to introduce several amendments dealing with conservation easements The proposed amendments were killed and the full Assembly then voted Were encouraged by the forward progress the Assembly vote represents toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore us to credit worthiness said Bob Foster Edison International senior vice president The bill provides just billion which still leave us at risk Mr Foster said The bill goes to the full Senate for a floor vote which could take place as soon as Monday lawmakers said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco said this week that the bill as amended by the Assembly was dead on arrival Other lawmakers including State Senator Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach also indicated that they would likely not support the bill as amended The Assembly version of the bill would give the state a fiveyear option to buy the utilitys power lines for billion or an estimated two times the current book value When the Senate passed the Edison rescue bill in July it only authorized the utility to sell billion in bonds and gave the state the option during the next five years to buy the power lines at current book value of billion The Senate has one week to decide whether it will pass the SoCal

vote on direct access the option of consumers to switch from their local utility to a competitor for cheaper power or electricity generated using renewable fuels Consumer advocates warn that businesses will use the time to convince officials that direct access should stay thereby shrinking the pool of ratepayers from which the state plans to recoup its powerbuying costs Consumer groups fear that will force the state to raise rates on the remaining customers State treasurer Phil Angelides says the state will have to retime its expected sale of billion in bonds because of the PUCs

proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co residential customers by an average of percent A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co billion Southern California Edison Co billion and SDGE billion to help the state recoup its powerbuying costs And the suspension of consumers choice to switch from a local utility to a competing power marketer THE PROBLEM High demand high wholesale energy costs transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California s electricity crisis Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say theyve lost nearly billion since June to high wholesale prices the states electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers PGE saying it hasnt received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers filed for federal bankruptcy protection April Electricity and natural gas suppliers scared off by the companies poor credit ratings are refusing to sell to them leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities nearly million residential and business customers The state is also buying power for a third investorowned utility San Diego Gas Electric which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PGE but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs The

Dow Jones Company Inc California s plan to sell billion worth of bonds to cover extraordinary electricity costs is hitting snags that could delay the record debt issuance well into next year forcing the state to issue more shortterm paper than expected to cover a financing gap Fridays Wall Street Journal reported The bond issuance is contingent on the states being able to ensure a secure revenue stream from electricity sales so it can both pay power suppliers and cover interest payments on the planned bonds But this week the states largest utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp San Francisco said it would go to court rather than pay million more for electricity procured by the state than the utility believes is its rightful share Pacific Gas which earlier this year sought bankruptcycourt protection objects to a proposed order by the California Public Utilities Commission to place of the power costs incurred by the California Department of Water Resources on PGE customers The department began procuring power on behalf of cashstrapped utilities in January after wholesalepower prices in California surged to unprecedented levels According to the draft order due to be voted on by the commission later this month the state plans to charge PGE for power obtained in the northern part of the state Critics say this ignores the fact that the tally of costs has to do more with where power plants are located than it does with where electricity is consumed Energy is shifted around the state through a highvoltage transmission system The upshot would be that PGE customers would pay the department cents a kilowatt hour for electricity By contrast customers of No utility Southern California Edison Co a unit of Edison International Rosemead Calif would pay cents a kilowatt hour SoCal Edison also has been financially weakened by California s energy crisis and is awaiting passage of a bill in the state legislature that would give it cash in exchange for its transmission and other assets Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved California s PUC Approves Some Agreements But All is Not Go on Power Sale By Deborah Finestone The Bond Buyer Page Copyright c Thomson Financial Inc All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO The California Public Utilities Commission yesterday narrowly approved three utility servicing agreements that need to be in place before the state Department of Water Resources can begin its planned October sale of billion in power purchase revenue bonds Commissioners postponed voting on the controversial issue of suspending ratepayer choice enacted as part of the states deregulated power market Suspending a utility customers ability to seek electricity from sources outside the utility is seen as a crucial element for the bond sale because it will ensure the number of customers whose rate payments will secure the bonds The fivemember commission now plans to vote Thursday on that and other topics postponed earlier this week including agreeing to cover DWRs revenue needs in retail rates and approving the rate agreement the contract giving the DWR ratemaking authority to cover its costs until the bonds have been repaid The commission also will vote on raising rates for San Diego Gas Electric customers State Treasurer Philip Angelides warned late Wednesday afternoon that the state of California cannot move forward to market and sell the bonds until the commission takes the required actions Angelides said in a statement that his office will release a revised timetable for bond issuance only after the PUC has acted on all the items indicating that the deal could possibly be postponed again if the PUC continues to delay voting on critical matters The servicing agreements approved yesterday are the contracts that spell out that Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric will act as billing and collection agents for the DWR will distribute the power DWR buys for its customers and will each maintain a separate fund for revenues to remit to DWR Dissenting commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque opposed the agreements because the portion of rates for the DWR will not be a separate item on customers bills Like some consumer groups and utilities the commissioners are concerned that DWR has too much power since it became authorized to buy electricity for the state under Assembly Bill X People should know that the rate increases are for DWR but the utilities are taking the heat since DWR began spending in effect like a drunken sailor Bilas said This approval of the agreements will display to the financial community that we are moving forward on AB X but I think AB X was a mistake Duque expressed his hopes for passage of a Senate bill currently under consideration that would show the DWR setaside on customers utility bills The bill if approved would set aside part of existing consumer electricity rates to guarantee the state has enough money to pay off bonds issued by the DWR but subject other expenses to review by the PUC The bill sponsored by Sen John Burton DSan Francisco reportedly passed a key Assembly committee yesterday When AB X became law in February Angelides had expected the bonds to sell in May Until earlier this week the treasurer had planned to begin issuing bonds in late October After the PUC acts there is a one to twomonth appeal period Commissioner Carl Wood expressed concern that the commission was taking so long to end ratepayer choice Were being negligent in failing to respond to this threat not only to the viability of the state bond issue but to basic fairness Wood said The longer we drag this out the more damage that is done However delays to address the complex issues prior to selling the bonds will help ensure a more successful bond sale according to David Blair a senior analyst at Nuveen Advisory Corp Its encouraging to see the state being very diligent and addressing issues before the bonds come out he said The various delays and complications certainly make me more careful in evaluating it but it underscores the importance of having a structure that is rock solid and protected by law Good Omens for Calif Gos By Deborah Finestone The Bond Buyer Page Copyright c Thomson Financial Inc All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO California s million general obligation sale Tuesday should meet strong demand despite uncertainties surrounding the longdelayed billion power bond deal still hanging in the wings investors said The GO deal is expected to do well because investors continue to seek alternatives to the equity markets and because prices for outstanding California GOs have rebounded following a selloff earlier this year at the height of the states energy crisis Because of the lack of supply in California the deal should do really well regardless of uncertainty around the power deal said Dan Solender California fund manager for Vanguard Group Inc The states GO bonds are still considered a good credit There hasnt been a large new issue in California in the last few weeks so its a great time to bring in a new deal The bonds to be sold in separate series under bond acts authorized by state voters over the years will be priced competitively More than million of the proceeds will be used to fund school facility improvements Insurance can be obtained at the option of the bidders Vanguard was one of many funds that sold California bonds earlier in the year because of uncertainty surrounding the states credit rating but we started buying them back around the June GO deal when spreads really widened so they were really attractive to buy Solender said Spreads have since tightened because the energy crisis seems to have died down he said When California sold GOs last June it was forced to pay basis points above the tripleA scale on bonds due in years but the sale was considered a success because some had feared the state would have to pay as much as basis points more to sell the bonds The sale came on the heels of downgrades by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Standard Poors in April cut the state to Aplus from AA In May Moodys downgraded the state to Aa from Aa Yield spreads on bonds due in years tightened to basis points above the tripleA scale in the secondary market on Wednesday as California experienced fewer rolling blackouts this summer than expected and after wholesale power prices declined because of federal mitigation and the states negotiation of longterm contracts that allowed it to avoid buying so much power at high market prices Nevertheless ratings analysts still assign the state a negative outlook It seems the situation has improved even if the state hasnt gotten the power deal done Solender said Even though the shortterm outlook has brightened California still has to find a way to complete the Department of Water Resources billion revenue bond sale Solender said The state needs to sell those bonds in order to obtain funds to reimburse itself for more than billion it has spent this year to purchase power on behalf of the states crippled utilities and to have cash on hand to finance more power purchases But the deal which would be the largest municipal bond offering in history has been delayed several times because of the complexities of putting such a massive debt offering together We all expected ups and downs through the whole process but there are still a lot of questions to get answered Solender said We all expect the state to get it done otherwise it would be hurting the trading value on GO bonds As much as the state may try to detach the power bonds from more normal financing plans investors are looking at both another investment analyst said David Blair senior analyst at Nuveen Advisory Corp said the two issues are connected because even though the general fund is no longer being used to fund power purchases California needs the power bond proceeds to replenish it In looking at the states outlook you have to look at some of the risks it faces in resolving the power crisis While theres a general expectation in the market that the power bond deal will get done its not guaranteed so people are keeping their eye on the developments Blair said While officials continue piecing together the power bond deal the states general fund should not need to loan more to the Water Resources Department even if power bonds are not issued this fiscal year according to official documents for the GO sale The department also has sufficient funds available to purchase power for the rest of the fiscal year As of midAugust about billion in the departments powerpurchase fund had not yet been committed The state expects to maintain adequate cash reserves for the fiscal year even if the department cannot sell the bonds and repay the billion in loans it owes the general fund according to official documents Officials also said none of the litigation regarding the energy situation seeks a judgment against the general fund California plans to issue billion in revenue anticipation notes on Thursday to meet cashflow needs The Ran deal gives the state a little more flexibility so things arent as dire as they looked several months ago Blair said But completing the power bond sale is crucial to California s financial health according to Blair because the states cash balances at the end of fiscal will be much lower without the billion expected from the power bonds Blair noted that the October sale date for the power bonds was looking less likely given this weeks postponement by the Public Utilities Commission of rulings needed to sell the bonds including a vote on a rate agreement that would provide the revenue to repay the debt Still the energy crisis has stabilized in the past several months allowing the California bond market to strengthen especially in the retail sector he said People are running for shelter from the equity market he said Fitch affirmed its AA rating on the new issue and the states billion in outstanding GO debt which has been on Rating Watch Negative since April The negative watch reflects continued uncertainties about the states powerpurchase program and billions of dollars in outstanding loans to the department Financial risk to the general fund will continue until it is reimbursed Fitch analysts said Additionally state revenue estimates were lowered in May largely due to volatile capital gains and personal income tax receipts But in July the first month of the fiscal year revenues were over estimates though the California economy is evidently slowing The state expects to end the year with a generalfund balance of billion Fitch said On Wednesday Standard Poors assigned its highest note rating to the states Ran offering and affirmed its Aplus rating with a negative outlook on the GOs The rating reflects the potential for additional generalfund purchases if the current power bond plan falls through and electricity prices rise the possible longterm detrimental effect on the states economy of retail electric rate hikes and possible further rate increases to recapitalize the states insolvent investorowned utilities However analysts said California s economy remains strong and diversified and continues to grow Projected fund balances are adequate assuming reimbursement of the general fund with power bond proceeds Moodys was expected to release its rating report on the GOs today Public Resources Advisory Group serves as the states financial adviser on the GO deal Orrick Herrington Sutcliffe is bond counsel the Law Office of Pamela S Jue is cobond counsel and Quateman Zidell is disclosure counsel California s Plan for Billion of Bonds To Cover Electricity Costs Runs Into Snags By Rebecca Smith The Wall Street Journal Page A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc California s plan to sell billion worth of bonds to cover extraordinary electricity costs is hitting snags that could delay the record debt issuance well into next year forcing the state to issue more shortterm paper than expected to cover a financing gap The bond issuance is contingent on the states being able to ensure a secure revenue stream from electricity sales so it can both pay power suppliers and cover interest payments on the planned bonds But this week the states largest utility Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of PGE Corp San Francisco said it would go to court rather than pay million more for electricity procured by the state than the utility believes is its rightful share Pacific Gas which earlier this year sought bankruptcycourt protection objects to a proposed order by the California Public Utilities Commission to place of the power costs incurred by the California Department of Water Resources on PGE customers The department began procuring power on behalf of cashstrapped utilities in January after wholesalepower prices in California surged to unprecedented levels According to the draft order due to be voted on by the commission later this month the state plans to charge PGE for power obtained in the northern part of the state Critics say this ignores the fact that the tally of costs has to do more with where power plants are located than it does with where electricity is consumed Energy is shifted around the state through a highvoltage transmission system The upshot would be that PGE customers would pay the department cents a kilowatt hour for electricity By contrast customers of No utility Southern California Edison Co a unit of Edison International Rosemead Calif would pay cents a kilowatt hour SoCal Edison also has been financially weakened by California s energy crisis and is awaiting passage of a bill in the state legislature that would give it cash in exchange for its transmission and other assets There is nothing on Gods green Earth that can justify that differential PGE Senior Vice President Dan Richard said Anticipating a possible delay to the bond issue the state is planning to issue billion worth of revenue anticipation notes or RANs on Sept RANs are a financing tool routinely used to smooth out cashflow imbalances caused by the occasionally jerky flow of tax receipts In this case though the money is being collected to tide the state over until the power bonds can be issued In June California borrowed billion from banks to augment the roughly billion it has borrowed from the states general fund for power purchases State Treasurer Philip Angelides said this week that once the RANs are issued the state will have enough money to cover its power costs until the middle of next year However a delay in issuing bonds would in turn postpone repayment of the bank debt whose interest rate steps up over time Until now the states timetable for issuing bonds has assumed that all legal challenges to about half a dozen fundingrelated orders expected to be issued by the publicutilities commission would be completed in October Mr Angelides said he hopes the state still can issue bonds in November but acknowledges its subject to change as events unfold USA Calif Assembly passes SoCal Edison rescue bill By Alex Gronke Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited SACRAMENTO Calif Sept Reuters The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill designed to save utility Southern California Edison SCE from bankruptcy and it now moves to the state Senate where it faces potentially its toughest hurdle The bill based on a memorandum of understanding between Calif Gov Gray Davis and the utility in April passed on a vote Under Assembly rules it had needed to secure at least votes to pass the member chamber It would allow the company to recover about billion of the estimated billion debt it incurred buying power for its customers at skyrocketing wholesale prices last year Consumer groups have been leading the campaign against the bill which they consider a bailout at the expense of the utilitys ratepayers The bill originated in the state Senate but has been extensively amended by Assembly committees and the current version is much more favorable to the utility than the one cleared by the Senate in a tight vote last month Davis has been lobbying intensively for the bill but several leading lawmakers including Senate leader John Burton have indicated the revised version will face an uphill task winning sufficient support when it returns to the Senate for concurrence on Assembly amendments SCE a unit of Edison International was prohibited from passing on its higher costs due to a retail price freeze imposed under the states power deregulation legislation The bill would allow the utility Californias second largest to recover the billion through a bond issue that would be repaid by a mandatory charge on business customers The states largest utility PGE Corp unit Pacific Gas Electric filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in April after failing to agree on a salvage plan with Davis and his negotiating team California took over purchasing power for customers of the utilities in January as plunging credit ratings made it impossible for them to buy power in the wholesale market The state has been seeking to make SCE creditworthy again so it can resume purchasing power on behalf of its customers SCE based in Rosemead Calif has some million customers while San Franciscobased Pacific Gas Electric has around million Enron must give documents to Calif lawmakersjudge Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Sept Reuters Enron Corp must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the states energy crisis a California judge ruled on Thursday But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firms right to maintain proprietary secrets If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights attorneys to surrender their attorneyclient privilege and psychiatrists to surrender their privileges the judge wrote The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some billion for wholesale electricity during the states energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the states poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its million residents and its industries An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets for example would be protected under a confidentiality agreement The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne We are pleased with the judges order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected Denne said The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since but has not yet come up for a vote Atlantabased Mirant Corp however avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators demands to sign confidentiality

Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited SAN FRANCISCO Sept Reuters The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday delayed again a vote to suspend retail power choice one of the cornerstones of the states electricity deregulation law Loretta Lynch president of the CPUC said a vote on a proposed order to suspend retail customers right to select their power supplier was delayed until a special meeting on Sept That meetings agenda will also include several items that establish the legal framework for the state to move ahead with a record sale of billion in power purchase bonds The regulators have delayed votes on both issues since early this year while they have held hearings and prepared the complex measures needed to get the bond issue under way Retail choice also called direct access gives electricity users the right to pick their power provider bypassing the local utility in the search for the most competitively priced energy The option was built into Californias deregulation scheme but almost all residential and small business customers ignored it and stuck with their local utility to provide bundled energy services CPUC Commissioner Carl Wood said that despite populist rhetoric about retail choice in the deregulation law big businesses demanded that the option be included so they could switch power suppliers and avoid paying their share of past debts incurred by the utilities When power shortages sent wholesale power prices soaring last year independent power suppliers dumped their customers back on the utilities Wood said Now when some order has been restored to the market and the high prices have come down suddenly direct access looks viable again Its a Gold Rush he added State officials fear that keeping the direct access option in place offers industrial customers a way to buy power from new suppliers and dodge paying for the emergency power supplies already purchased by Californias Department of Water Resources The water agency has spent more than billion to buy power for the states financially troubled utilities PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edison Internationals Southern California Edison The PGE utility is bankrupt and Gov Gray Davis is scrambling to get the legislature to approve a billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison The two utilities ran out of money buying power in the states volatile

a measure to charge power producers a windfall profits tax on earnings in the state that are deemed excessive The bill would levy a tax on some profits by power sellers The proceeds from the tax would be returned to Californians through an annual holiday from state sales taxes during the first weekend in December The bill needs votes or twothirds of the Assembly for passage The Assembly had planned on taking up the measure for vote this afternoon That vote probably wont happen until tomorrow or over the weekend because of a snafu over printing new amendments to the bill said Kirsten Xanthippe an aide to Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett the Democrat from San Leandro who wrote the legislation California Governor Gray Davis has denounced generators as outofstate profiteers and is asking federal regulators to order billions of dollars in refunds Generators say their prices have been fair A windfallprofits tax is unnecessary and would discourage powerplant construction in the state power

approved a similar bill by Senator Nell Soto a Democrat from Ontario that would require the California Public Utilities Commission to determine a reasonable price for power companies to charge including a set profit Companies selling power at higher rates would face a percent tax on the additional profit Enron Wins Document Protection Order From Calif Judge OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesA Sacramento Superior Court judge Thursday ruled that Enron Corp must comply with a legislative subpoena of financial documents but reversed an earlier decision and granted the company a protective order of the documents according to a copy of the ruling seen by Dow Jones Newswires Enron said the ruling was a victory as the company has always maintained it would be happy to comply with the subpoena by the state Senate committee as long as the company received a protective order We are obviously very happy with the ruling and look forward to working with the committee to come up with a protective order that truly protects our proprietary information said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer The Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy Inc with contempt for refusing to provide documents a charge for which the companies could be fined Once Enron and the committee draft a protective order and the judge agrees to it the company will hand over any documents that the committee wants Palmer said However an attorney for the committee expressed skepticism that the company would actually follow through We have no indication from Enron that they would agree to produce the documents weve requested even with the confidentiality order said Larry Drivon special counsel to the committee He added that he could not speculate if the committee would drop its contempt charge if Enron did produce all requested documents In his decision granting the protective order Judge Charles Kobayashi wrote that he was not convinced the committee has solid standards in place to ensure Enrons protection It is clear that there are no standards for determining what are the available protections no procedure for determining what is a legitimately confidential privileged proprietary matter no procedure for oversight and no prescribed remedy for Enron for any unauthorized disclosures Kobayashi wrote Last week a San

Of Elec Suppliers LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Public Utilities Commission Thursday postponed until Sept voting on a plan to suspend customer choice of electricity providers one of several measures that needs to be passed before the state can issue billion in revenue bonds As reported the commission also postponed voting on a rate agreement that would allow the state Department of Water Resources to recover powerbuying costs without regulatory review and a vote that would set the amount of revenue the CDWR can receive from utilities through The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the states three investorowned utilities since January The commission also suspended a vote for a rate hike for customers of Sempra unit San Diego Gas and Electric Co All of the above measures need to be passed before the state bond sale can proceed The CPUC hopes to vote on all outstanding items related to the bond sale Sept Lynch said Thursday The state plans to sell a record billion in revenue bonds by late October The bonds will be used to repay about billion borrowed from the states general fund for power purchases as well as smooth out payments on billion in longterm power contracts Lynch said Wednesday she did not know if the vote postponements would push the date of the bond sale No one at the State Treasurers office which is handling the bond sale could be reached for comment The commission did approve measures Thursday to establish servicing agreements between the three utilities and the CDWR which would set formal payment arrangements for power procurement Those votes

Over Enron New York Times DWP Far Exceeded Profit It Reported Energy An independent audit finds the utilitys return was double the the agency said it made selling power during the crisis Officials deny price gouging By DOUG SMITH and RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J LOPEZ TIMES STAFF WRITERS During the peak of Californias power crisis the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials have previously acknowledged according to a newly completed independent audit The document obtained by The Times under the California Public Records Act seems sure to reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes The audit also undercuts efforts by Gov Gray Davis and others to pin the blame for rising energy costs mainly on private outofstate generating companies For months DWP officials have deflected questions about their prices by insisting that the agency sold power for just above its costs As recently as July former DWP chief S David Freeman who now heads Davis new statewide power authority repeated that assurance in a letter to US senators probing the energy meltdown But the audit findings show that DWPs profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged last year under Freemans stewardship Overall during the worst months of the crisis ending in May records show that the DWP profited million on sales of million It says it is still owed million Beyond those higher profits the DWP included expenses in its cost component that have little to do with generating electricity They include a million cut for the citys general fundessentially a bonus for the utilitys ownerand an additional million in overhead for such things as debt payment and return on the agencys capital investments These overhead charges are three times higher than the amount considered reasonable by federal regulators In effect unsuspecting ratepayers across the state whose utilities have been battered by debt are helping to pick up the tab for services that DWP consumers and city taxpayers would otherwise have to pay In an interview late last week Freeman defended those costs and DWPs profits saying the agency went out of its way to help the state avert blackouts by cranking up its output from costly plants He insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than We made a fair amount of money It was not price gouging said Freeman who contends that he led efforts to cap spiraling wholesale prices last year Freeman said he has not seen the audit but if profits were higher than then Im not embarrassed about it It says nothing more than theres enterprise at the DWP The DWPs new general manager David Wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy within the agency during Freemans tenure Maybe in hindsight Wiggs said it would have been better not to be so specific but to say Look were gonna limit our recovery to a reasonable return for our customers Still Wiggs said even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive We charged just and reasonable rates he said adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin Wiggs ordered the audit in May as questions intensified about the role of the DWP and other public power agencies in driving up the price of wholesale electricity during periods of scarcity Conducted by the auditing firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers the study targeted a month period beginning in May The results have provided critics with new ammunition Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said Harry Snyder senior advocate for Consumers Union This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companiesnot a public agency Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs Committee which is investigating the crisis was one of those recently assured by Freeman in writing that DWPs profits were limited to This is a cause for concern and deserves greater scrutiny he said after learning of the audit It would be ironic if it turns out that the LA Department of Water and Power was charging more than Gov Davis Texas Pirates said Thompson The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from the private generators contracting and wholesale prices exploding To keep the power flowing the DWPwhich had opted out of deregulationcranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market This helped avert even more extensive blackouts than the state experienced At the same time however the DWP and other publicly owned utilities in California and elsewhere charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports would later show Freeman repeatedly said the utilitys prices were high because it was forced to use its most costly inefficient plants But the audit raises such serious questions about the DWPs behavior that the matter has spilled into the gubernatorial contest Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan a possible Republican challenger to Davis last week moved to distance himself from the profits racked up by the DWP during his City Hall tenure In a letter to his successor James K Hahn the former mayor said he only recently learned that the agency may have exceeded its stated profit ceiling If so he said the city should consider cutting a deal with the utilities and the state to reduce the estimated million the city says it is still owed from earlier sales A Riordan spokesman said the former mayor deferred to the DWP to set prices for its electricity The mayor never directed them to generate a profit from these sales said Jaime de la Vega a senior advisor to Riordans campaign committee Freeman now squarely in the Davis camp disputes Riordans account He said the mayor repeatedly questioned the agencys pricing strategy He wanted to charge more according to Freeman in case the city only got a partial payment from Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison which were slipping into insolvency Freeman described Riordans view as If were gonna continue to sell it to them we ought to get a lot of money He was thinking of it the way a good businessman thinks of it For the most part the Davis administration has gone light on public agencies that have profited in Californias haywire energy market Freeman contends that other suppliers drove prices higher through aggressive bidding practices that lifted the entire market including his agency But according to a report by the states grid operator DWP was one of the most aggressive along with the trading arm of BC Hydro the governmentowned utility in British Columbia Yet another reportthis one by the states powerbuying agencyfound that the DWP and some other public utilities charged higher than average prices during the first quarter of this year The report said DWP charged an average of per megawatt hour asking more than many private generators It could not be determined how much the utility was charging per megawatt hour last year when its profit margin was even higher Even after the market problems cited by Freeman were corrected earlier this year the DWP collected profits more than higher than it claimed to have netted records show Overall during the month period audited profits averaged double the return the agency has publicly stated it was receiving Although Davis and his aides have tried to keep the focus on Texasbased energy suppliers Republican lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington have been broadening the debate to include the conduct of governmentowned utilities One key question is whether those agencies like private suppliers should be forced to refund excess profits The primary venue for refund orders has been the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission which is expected to rule in December on whether the state should receive the billions of dollars it claims to have been overcharged DWP insists it is outside the commissions jurisdiction But some California legislators argue that state law may give them authority to demand refunds from public utilities The leading proponent of that course is state Sen Ray Haynes RRiverside In a letter to a Senate investigating committee last month he said he fears that the continuing disclosures about the DWP and others are merely the tip of the iceberg relating to greed of instate public utility agencies The chairman of that committee Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana said his panel will examine the activities of these agencies in the months ahead State Faces Crunch Time to Deal With Electricity Costs Energy With one week left in the legislative session lawmakers and regulators want to resolve questions on how California will recoup its expenditures during power crisis After a summer of delays California regulators and legislators are aiming in one final week to resolve issues crucial to millions of electricity customers and the financial stability of the state and its utilities The energy crisis that caused blackouts early this year has receded but it has left behind a potential fiscal crisis The state needs to recoup more than billion that it has spent on power and it has signed billion in longterm electricity contracts Final plans for meeting these financial obligationsand spreading the pain of paying them offhave been debated for months But the decision time has come Legislators are scheduled to recess for the year on Friday and the state Public Utilities Commission is under pressure to act on several longpending measures at a meeting on Thursday Whats before the state both at the PUC and the Legislature is how are we going to provide power to people in the years to come PUC President Loretta M Lynch said in an interview Are we going to have a healthy utility to provide the power or are we going to rely on the state The PUC which approved the biggest rate increase in history earlier this year now faces another tough choice Should it surrender its formerly ironclad authority over electricity rates to the state Department of Water Resources an agency that has come under fire for alleged conflicts of interest and the cost of its contracts Or should it balk and jeopardize the states planned sale of bonds to replenish the treasury and repay loans Legislation on Related Issues Legislators are grappling with two complicated and highly contested bills on related issues One seeks to repair the finances of Southern California Edison through a billion aid plan backed by Gov Gray Davis The other would limit the powers of the Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for million customers of Edison Pacific Gas Electric Co and San Diego Gas Electric since January The state law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power exempted the purchases from PUC reviews designed to protect consumers from unreasonable charges Now the department is seeking a formal agreement with the PUC that would guarantee that its cost of supplying power to utility customers will be fully covered Critics say the accord is a blank check for future rate increases but the department says no increases will be necessary in the foreseeable future State officials say the PUC has little choice but to sign the agreement which they see as necessary to reassure Wall Street bankers that the Department of Water Resources will be able to repay billion in bonds the state plans to sell to cover power costs The money from those bonds will go in part to repay the state treasury for money laid out for power Top state officials including the governor and treasurer want the bond sale to go without a hitch but the date of the sale already has been pushed back several months and threatened litigation could further delay it The urgency over the bonds comes about because the state already has used billion from the treasury and has taken out a billion loan to cover power costs State Treasurer Phil Angelides said that if the bonds are unsold and the economy slows down next year the state could be revisiting the fiscal crisis of the early s People ought to be laying down their arms over their energy agendas and asking the question What is the best and fastest way to repay the state general fund to ensure critical programs such as education and health get their funding he said Lynch one of three Davis appointees on the fivemember PUC finds herself in a particularly difficult position She sees the value of PUC reviews of the reasonableness of power purchases But Lynch said If we do not enter into a rate agreement the bonds do not issue and that could affect the state general fund The thing I care about most she added is ensuring the general fund is repaid Earlier this month Lynch issued a draft decision that would have the PUC essentially rubberstamp any future revenue requests or rate increases sought by the Department of Water Resources But she also has publicly endorsed a bill by state Sen John Burton DSan Francisco that the Davis administration opposes The bill would ensure that the PUC has the right to scrutinize the revenue needs of the Department of Water Resources and hold public hearings It would not however give the PUC the power to disallow department expenses To reassure Wall Street the bill would dedicate a portion of the money that utilities collect from their customers to repaying the bonds At a PUC meeting last Thursday PUC commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque appointees of former Gov Pete Wilson voiced support for the Burton bill saying it would let the PUC shed additional light on the Department of Water Resources powerrelated expenditures The Davis administration opposes the bills present form but is seeking amendments One concern is that energy providers would sue out of fear that if money runs short bondholders would be paid before they are The bills passage could be a deal breaker for the bond sales said contractor Joseph Fichera a financial advisor to Davis At the least contentious debate surrounding energyrelated issues could drive up the price of floating bonds Fichera said Wall Street does not like risk Conflict implies risk So the more we create the more we are costing ratepayers he said The Legislature also is considering a bill that would allow Edison to sell bonds to pay off about threequarters of the debt it accrued during the energy crisis The utility would have to handle on its own about billion owed to large energy companies Consumer activists have threatened a ballot initiative to block the bill which they call a bailout The PUC on Thursday is scheduled to vote on several items designed to ease the sale of the Department of Water Resources bonds One is a rate increase for SDGE customers Another measure would suspend the right of businesses and other electricity customers to stop buying electricity from their local utility and choose their own power provider The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets an organization that includes many large California businesses said its members would be forced to sue if the PUC goes ahead with plans to retroactively void the right of customers to choose their own energy providers But the most controversial item has been the proposed PUC agreement with the Department of Water Resources Consumer groups and utilities alike have called for public examinations of the departments contracts and revenue requirements The plan would allow a state agency to operate behind closed doors while it negotiates with ratepayers money said Douglas Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Secrecy in DWR leads to conflicts of interest and that leads to higher rates Concerns about the Department of Water Resources lack of independent oversight have been heightened by recent developments Energy experts have questioned the qualifications of the trading team the department assembled and several traders were fired for alleged conflicts of interest Critics seized on reports that the department sold surplus power at a loss of million in July although officials say surpluses are bound to occur with longterm power contracts And the departments projections of its revenue needs for future power purchases have been updated and amended twice prompting utilities and others to question the reliability of the figures PGE Threatens to Sue Over Revenue The utilities want the department to be subject to the sort of reviews that have rankled them for years If the PUC does not provide for that lawsuits could be coming PGE which already is in bankruptcy has threatened to sue if the Department of Water Resources revenue requirement doesnt leave the utility a sufficient share of the rate increase adopted by state regulators in March PGE recently asked a Sacramento County Superior Court judge to require the Department of Water Resources to hold public hearings on its revenue requirements The company has reacted angrily to a draft PUC decision to shift million of the states cost of buying power from Edison to PGE saying the plan was illegal and discriminates against PGE customers Davis aides have defended the Department of Water Resources and its power purchases saying the departments longterm contracts helped cool the energy crisis They look overpriced now Fichera said But four months ago they were underpriced compared with the spot market They are an insurance policy against market volatility Having the PUC review actions of another state agency would be redundant and would serve no purpose Fichera said because the contracts already are in place You cant break contracts he said Youve got to pay them Even some critics acknowledge it is difficult to evaluate the Department of Water Resources performance to date One reason is that the department has closely guarded details about its contracts and its spot purchases arguing that release of too much information would place it at a competitive disadvantage Another reason is that market conditions have changed and natural gas prices have declined since the department entered into contracts amid the energy crisis We all have hindsight said PUC Commissioner Bilas When DWR entered into contracts the state was over the barrel Now we can say that they are not as good as the department thought and that DWR does a lousy job of negotiating contracts But thats unfair Green energy sources seen as ripe for growth By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer Published Sept Wind and hot water sunshine and rotting garbage They all could keep Californias lights on for a price Around the state more people are beginning to suggest that price is worth paying to help smooth out the ride on the states power roller coaster This week Sacramentos municipal utility will begin hearings on an ambitious year plan that would nearly triple its reliance on nonhydroelectric sources of renewable electric power such as wind farms and solar panels In the Legislature a hotly debated bill would require every power seller in the state to provide increasing amounts of green power rising to percent of their portfolios by That would roughly double current supplies This may be the silver lining of the energy crisis if we can get this passed said state Sen Byron Sher DPalo Alto author of SB More than a dozen states and many nations already have portfolio standards that require each utility or other power venders to provide a set share of electricity from renewable sources The amounts can be as low as percent or percent or as high as partly depending on what gets called renewable Environmental and some consumer groups have embraced the idea saying it would bring a constellation of advantages The air would be cleaner they say Finite resources such as coal natural gas and other fossil fuels would be used more sparingly And in California the state would be a little less vulnerable next time prices sail through the stratosphere for natural gas the chosen fuel for virtually all new power plants But freemarket advocates and some utilities are dubious They worry that a statemandated portfolio standard would drive up prices It could reward inefficiencies in energy sources that are otherwise too expensive to stand on their own And in the push to diversify from natural gas critics of such standards dont want to see the state turn its back on potentially lower cost power sources including coal nuclear power and new large dams Ignoring hydroelectric power is shortsighted and I think not considering nuclear options within the state at least giving it some public hearing is shortsighted said Karal Cottrell a Sacramento Municipal Utility District director It is a debate that will help shape Californias power future and it comes as the state has begun loading up on natural gas plants Just over half of instate electricity production now is fueled by natural gas but that could rise to percent by if all currently proposed gasfired plants are built said Mark Bernstein an energy analyst at RAND Long viewed as relatively cheap and comparatively clean natural gas still could pose risks if it dominates the states power picture We have a very hard time predicting the price of anything particularly energy these days said Bernstein What happens if the pressures on price are so great that they go way up That fear has been sobering for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District whose officials worry the utility might be becoming too dependent on two mainstays hydro power with its risks of short supplies in dry years and natural gas Already considered a leader in renewable power SMUD gets about percent of its electricity from nonhydro renewables In a series of workshops beginning Tuesday it will seek public feedback on a proposed year plan that would raise that amount to percent by and percent by If we commit to this this will be the largest renewable commitment I believe in the state right now General Manager Jan Schori told directors Renewable power would cost more but the benefits in diversification and price stability should be worth it said SMUD planning chief Jim Tracy His proposal calls for spending no more than an extra penny per kilowatthour for renewables At first SMUD plans to expand its Solano County wind farm continue subsidizing solar panels and consider working with the county to expand the Kiefer landfill plant which runs on methane seeping out of rotting garbage That should get the utility close to percent By staffers would return to the board with a study on how to reach the far more challenging second phase boosting green power another percent at a livable price The likeliest costeffective sources so far look like wind and geothermal power said Tracy Thats also the consensus among those who hope the state will pass its own portfolio standard before the Legislature adjourns Friday Wind turbines once disparaged as generating more tax breaks than electricity have become bigger more powerful and far more dependable in the past decade Aided by a federal tax credit they now can supply power at between cents and cents a kilowatthour depending on location according to the American Wind Energy Association At its lower end that makes wind nearly competitive with a new natural gas plant Geothermal power tapped by drilling into underground beds of hot steam or water runs between cents and cents a kilowatthour and could go lower if it too qualifies for the next round of federal credits plant developers say Both sources of power are plentiful in California The state is the th best source of wind in the nation with untapped wind resources along mountain ridges running almost the length of the state Geothermal power already makes up percent of the states supply and could rise by thousands of megawatts with rich beds in the Imperial Valley and elsewhere still not fully tapped By comparison solar power costs more than cents a kilowatthour although it can have special appeal to homeowners living far from power lines or those who want to produce their own electricity Both wind and geothermal could be a shooin economically if natural gas prices float higher said Matt Freedman of the Utility Reform Network a consumer group that usually advocates for lower power costs Today its also one of the biggest lobbyists for a renewable portfolio standard We think the standard is going to save consumers money or in the worst case its like an insurance policy said Freedman I think consumers are willing for that to be part of the mix these days But with only a week left to go Freedman said the enemy of Shers bill is time Thats actually just one of the enemies Others include Sempra Energy parent company of San Diego Gas Electric Co and the California Manufacturers Association which fear it would boost electric rates When a major thrust of the state is to reduce prices as much as possible is this really a good time for this asked Sempra spokesman Ed Van Herik Both Sempra and the Assemblys Republican caucus point out that more than million a year already is collected from consumers electric bills and funneled into a fund that supports renewable energy The portfolio standard could have Californians paying again up to the cents per kilowatthour cap in the bill for power that theyve already helped subsidize they say Renewable energies are becoming more efficient on their own said Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth RTemecula To artificially prop them up will stifle that innovation California already gets about percent of its total energy supply including imports from nonhydro renewables and an additional percent from small hydro The state Energy Commission predicts that current programs could boost that to percent by So to Sher author of the renewables bill raising that amount to percent by is actually a modest goal Were well on our way there he said Dan Walters As Davis and Burton spar big Capitol agenda remains unsettled Published Sept Theres no scientifically objective method of measuring such things the world still awaits the invention of a procrastimeter but its evident that as the final week of the legislative session begins there are an extraordinary number of pithy issues left to be resolved Although procrastination is a Capitol perennial whats different his year is that so many of them are significant matters of public policy that cannot simply roll over into including major pieces of the energy crisis puzzle such as Gov Gray Davis bailout of Southern California Edison Also on the pending agenda are redrawing legislative and congressional district boundaries multibilliondollar bond issues for schools and colleges a slew of labor benefit bills that business leaders call job killers a drive by trial lawyers to make it easier to open up confidential lawsuit settlements consumer protection measures that include those affecting privacy and predatory lending expansion of rights for gays and undocumented immigrants community college support and a potentially sweeping measure to expand health care access for the states huge uninsured population Why has so much been left to the final hours Some of it is human nature compounded by political skittishness But the extraordinary amount of serious legislating left to the last minute this year reflects both the unusual circumstances of this years session especially the energy crisis and an escalating conflict between the Capitols two most powerful Democrats Gov Gray Davis and Senate President Pro Tem John Burton The first half of the year was utterly dominated by the energy situation and then by a partisan conflict over the state budget as Californias economy softened and revenues dipped sharply Other legislative matters drifted until summers heat enveloped the Capitol The more important factor may be the DavisBurton feud which manifests itself in many ways but particularly on the two most important pieces of latesession business the Davissponsored Edison bailout and a multibilliondollar boost in benefits for workers with jobrelated illnesses and injuries carried personally by Burton As it happens the price tag on each is similar The Edison measure would authorize the utility to issue billion in bonds to repay its debts and at least in theory step back from the brink of bankruptcy The workers compensation bill sent to Davis desk last week would boost benefits by a similar amount each year Burton has denounced the Edison bill as a raid on ratepayers while Davis has in the past vetoed similar workers compensation measures and is being urged to do it again by employers who list it at the top of their job killer bills The two politicians have so much prestige on the line with the two measures that there have been recurrent rumors of a squeeze play in which Davis would have to agree to sign the workers comp bill to get his muchcherished Edison bailout although no one will say so publicly The BurtonDavis conflict however is far broader than these two bills They represent in effect the two faces of the Democratic Party Davis the cool businessfriendly centrist and Burton the passionate labororiented liberal and their personal relationship is practically nil Burton openly despises Davis as a betrayer of party principle and trashes him to anyone within earshot Davis is more circumspect but those around him contend in effect that if liberals like Burton had their way the Democratic Party would again become anathema to moderate voters and Republicans would regain their prominence in the state One reason for this years delays is that a huge wad of liberal legislation including many bills that Davis doesnt want to see on his desk is backed up and Burton could if he wishes dump it on the governor and make him decide whether to offend business or Democratic interest groups It is therefore a game of chicken Will Burton protect Davis from being caught in the middle by holding up the key bills andor agreeing to modifications or will he let the governor sweat CalISO Violating Fed Law By Making Utils Buy State Pwr Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This item was first published late Friday By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow Jones California s grid operator may be in violation of federal regulations by forcing utilities to buy expensive power the state secured under long and shortterm contracts in place of electricity that is available from their own lowcost power plants The California Independent System Operator the agency that operates the realtime electricity market and maintains reliability of the grid in the state has given priority during the past three months to power the state Department of Water Resources locked in under the billion of longterm contracts before utilizing electricity from lowcost power plants according to several executives at the agency Greg Fishman an ISO spokesman said there are times this doesnt happen much when because of varying ramp rates we take a bid out of sequence meaning when one plant has a bid of lets say a megawatthour and another has a bid we may take the bid because it would take longer to deliver the power Fishman said the market is not working as it is designed to Since the demise of the California Power Exchange we the industry have been forced to make the market function given the tools that we have Fishman said The PX was a major portion of the market Without it we are left trying to put the market back into shape given the current players in the market However the ISOs federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive electricity to generators and retail customers The ISO shall dispatch generating unitsto meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices reads a section of the rules approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO shall not discriminate between generating units system units loads and system resources other than based on price and the effectiveness location and ramp rate of the resource concerned to respond to the fluctuation in demand or generation Fishman acknowledged that the market is not working as it is designed to but he said the ISO would not respond to specific questions related to the possibility that the agency has violated its federal tariff or other issues related to the operation of the ISO market We are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues he said Agency Fails To Reveal Price Data For DWR Power Moreover the ISO has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the DWR power which is also required under federal regulations Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a trade group representing large and small power producers said there is absolutely no transparency in the ISO market No one knows what theyre paying for The DWR which started buying power in lieu of California s ailing utilities in January signed billion in longterm supply contracts over the past six months at prices that now exceed the spot market price for electricity The DWR at times has had a surplus of electricity and has sold some of it into the spot market at a million loss over the last three months As a result the ISO has ordered the Mohave Generating Station a coalfired power plant in Nevada capable of producing electricity at roughly cents a kilowatthour to reduce output at the facility Fishman said The megawatt Mohave unit is majority owned by Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison Fishman said last week that the ISO is investigating the circumstances that led the grid operator to order the units to ramp down POWER TO THE PEOPLE BLACKOUTS SHED LIGHT ON UPS ADVANTAGE Scott Campbell Computer Reseller News Page Copyright c CMP Media LLC So much for the California power crisis Solution providers spent much of last winter and spring installing uninterruptible power supplies UPSes because of anticipated rolling blackouts But a mild summer on the West Coast put those fears to rest In fact power companies in California even sold excess energy to neighboring states Still heightened awareness of the earlier energy crisis helped solution providers say executives Everybodys got blackout scares Thats where we position ourselves says Henry Ngo marketing manager at eSystems Design a Brea Califbased solution provider We go out to enterpriselevel accounts and we talk about rolling blackouts power surges and the backup power they need Theyre worried about losing data and jeopardizing their whole network infrastructure Although major outages havent occurred recently in California the powerprotection business remains steady In many cases UPSdriven leads have translated into profitable service opportunities Ngo says Selling UPSes gives us a chance to fish for the integration portionmaintenance services design network assessmentfor future projects Ngo says In the past two months eSystems has taken on about UPS deployments in enterprise accounts he says Sources at the Energy Information Administration say demand for electricity is expected to increase percent nationwide this year over last while generating capability will increase only percent In California energy consumption is expected to increase percent this year according to the government agency While other regions dont face the same problems as California solution providers see plenty of opportunity to deliver UPS solutions across the United States The combination of daily thunderstorms old buildings and Louisiana heat and humidity led Software Stuff to include UPS solutions in every recent project says Gary Shurman president of the Metairie Labased solution provider We do a lot of accounting software solutions and we wont install a network without a UPS on every server workstation hub and router says Shurman When we get a severe thunderstorm roll through here many times power will be out from a few minutes to a few hours You really get some equipment damage from that Implementing UPS solutions up front reduces Software Stuffs maintenance and warranty costs Shurman says You dont have to make service calls or replace equipment because of intermittent failures he says Adds Chris Boaglio senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems a Costa Mesa Califbased UPS vendor The power issue will be on the minds of solution providers and customers for the next six months to a year In some instances a UPS is considered a necessary peripheral Most customers need backup that is failsafe but the pain level is not there to spend money While customers arent clamoring for power protection now as they were when the California outages were at the top of the news theres still money to be made says Joe Wolf president of CompuSystems a Washington Mobased solution provider We have seen a lot of thunderstorms in our area and weve replaced more than modems in the last three weeks Wolf says But we still have to keep up the fight Its an ongoing thing You need to remind the customers every single time CompuSystems doesnt include UPS solutions when bidding projects he says but it reminds customers before any contracts are signed how important power protection can be for their business systems Meanwhile UPS vendors are using Web seminars and other training methods to ensure that solution providers can deliver an effective message about UPSes to end users Were working hard to make sure solution providers are armed with tools to help their customers whether theyre dealing with an existing powerprotection solution or the end user doesnt have anything at all says John Donovan director of reseller strategy at American Power Conversion West Kingston RI Businesses in the United States lose about billion annually because of power outages according to a recent report issued by the Electrical Power Research Institute Such statistics can be used to sell UPS solutions say solution providers Even in a small business the first time you have an outage you could put employees out of business for a day That could cost you up to plus lost sales Compare that loss to the cost of an inexpensive battery says Software Stuffs Shurman But end users are growing accustomed to having UPSes installed in new networks he says Its usually pretty painless with a new sale For existing customers that dont have UPSes we go in with powermeasuring equipment and prove to them whats happening with their power says Shurman When you show them what the spikes and drops look like for a hour period they get the picture But without that UPSes can be a hard sell he says The customer would call an electrician who would use a meter reader and say youve got volts so youre fine The global UPS market is expected to generate billion in sales this year and will see a compounded annual growth rate of percent between and says Farah Saeed an industry analyst with Frost and Sullivan In and we saw doubledigit growth but the sluggish economy and pricing pressure are factors in the market now Saeed says Its a very mature market and theres a lot of competition with inexpensive products coming from abroad The median price of a voltampere desktop UPS has fallen percent in the past year says Dave Slotten director of product management at Tripp Lite a Chicagobased UPS vendor For well under youre picking up a fine UPS for desktop protection with serial or USB connectivity Slotten says Theres no excuse not to have one The payback on them is so obvious Margins on UPS products have decreased along with margins on other hardware products but powerprotection equipment brings in supplemental revenue from service opportunities says eSystems Ngo UPS sales growth in the enterprise has been tempered by the slowdown in data center expansion Fewer new data centers translates into fewer UPSes sold and deployed in that space But UPS vendors remain bullish on longterm opportunities that may arise from powerrelated issues In California fundamental fixes arent in place Slotten says Theres still a trend to consume more and more power Then youve got the Bush administration talking about building more power plants but thats a decade off Smaller Lighter Faster Its been said that good things come in small packages Well it seems that folks in the UPS business are warming up to the old adage For a while the UPS earned itself a reputation as the PCs ball and chaina clunky addon that always seemed to get in the way But thanks to technology advances powerprotection systems are becoming lighter more compact and less expensive say vendor executives One thing thats been a hindrance in the UPS market is the size and weight of the products because of transformers and batteries says Chris Boaglio senior channel manager for VARs and computer distribution at MGE UPS Systems a Costa Mesa Califbased UPS manufacturer Transformers are extremely heavy components that add shipping costs and size to a product But some newer UPSes weigh up to percent less than their predecessors and dont compromise on reliability says Boaglio The combination of market maturation and new technology is appealing to end users says Henry Ngo marketing manager at eSystems Design Brea Calif Products are getting better and smaller and you can do more with less investment he says The two dominant UPS platforms today are online and lineinteractive Online productsthe newer and more expensive of the tworun continuously off a charging battery to provide clean consistent

pricing goes down they say Its like getting a Cadillac at a Chevy price says Dave Slotten director of product management at Chicagobased Tripp Lite Online UPSes regenerate perfect power for computing equipment not the spikes and dips that sometimes plague other powerprotection systems he says Spurring demand is the fact that UPS prices have fallen more than percent in the past year says Gary

Refund Claims By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES This article was originally published Friday WASHINGTON Dow Jones An expedited Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative hearing on claims for billion in refunds on electricity sales in the Pacific Northwest concluded Thursday after three days of legal wrangling The proceeding which FERC spun off from a highprofile controversial case involving California s powerrefund claims poses a legal and logistical hornets nest for the commission according to attorneys involved Power sellers subject to a possible FERC refund order themselves potentially could seek refunds for power they purchased in the region Untold billions of dollars of these socalled ripple refund claims were held in abeyance by the FERC administrative law judge presiding in the case But if FERC orders refunds these power sellers have reserved the right to seek refunds which in some cases could amount to more than they ultimately owe But thats a longterm issue More immediate is the power sellers constitutional dueprocess concerns about the expedited proceeding which allowed limited evidence and crossexamination of witnesses Then theres the problem of defining what is a spotmarket sale in what is largely a bilateral contracts market Various refund claims address not only sales of hours duration but monthlong blocks and in some cases longer than a year Meanwhile municipal utility sellers technically not subject to FERC regulatory jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act are challenging the commissions assertion of authority to order them to make refunds Municipal utilities make up roughly half of the Pacific Northwest market And finally the case has turned into a second bite of the apple for California in its effort to obtain refunds Roughly billion of the total claims is being sought by California with the remainder representing claims from a handful of municipal utilities in the region according to attorneys involved in the proceeding Of California s total claim more than million is sought from Powerex the US marketing arm of British Columbia Hydro a provincially owned utility for sales under contracts with the California Department of Water Resources this year I think its completely outrageous that California s asking for money said an attorney involved in the case We wouldnt be here if they hadnt screwed this thing up in the first place Most parties in the proceeding have asked the judge to throw out California s claims another attorney noted Five Municipal Northwest Utilities Seeking Refunds Only five municipal utilities in the Northwest are seeking refunds Seattle Wash million Tacoma Wash million Clark Wash Public Utilities million Eugene Ore Water Electric Board million the Port of Seattle Wash million and Northern Wasco County Ore Peoples Utility District million The vast majority of those involved in the market are due refunds but only a minority are seeking refunds said one attorney in the case among a handful contacted by Dow Jones Newswires who spoke freely on condition they not be identified Weve made clear if refunds are awarded we are going to come in and demand ours as well said an attorney representing a power marketer When the agency sees that it will be clear that they have opened a can of worms that they dont want to get into With the expedited hearing concluded parties in the proceeding must file position briefs by Sept with the administrative law judge hearing the case who is scheduled to forward her proposed findings of fact to the commission by Sept Jeff Goltz an attorney with the Washington state attorney generals office described the power sellers concerns about due process as misplaced Power sellers were concerned that the fate of billions of dollars hinged on a proceeding lasting a few days Goltz said But the proceeding actually was a vehicle to decide if FERC will proceed to a larger welldefined proceeding he said I wouldnt expect the FERC to take this and issue a refund decision Goltz said Attorneys representing power providers expressed the hope that FERC wont pursue refunds in the region We could get a refund said an attorney representing an investorowned utility in the region But our hope is the whole thing goes away which it should he said The whole things just too complicated I dont know how the judge is going to make a decision in this case The case represents a Pandoras box for the commission said an attorney representing a municipal utility in the region opposed to refunds This case has the potential to be far bigger than the California refund case because it involves essentially the entire Western United States the lawyer said If FERC pulls the strings and orders refunds it will trigger ripple refund claims involving hundreds of thousands of bilateral wholesale power sales contracts throughout the West he said Where it stops nobody knows If you start trying to unravel this market for the period in question December through June its not going to end for the foreseeable future said another attorney Each successive ripple will trigger more ripples If they do its going to keep the rest of us attorneys employed for a long time he said The only beneficiaries so far in this proceeding are the attorneys said another lawyer Any refunds are likely to much less than the attorney fees Report LA power agency made big profit during energy crisis Associated Press Newswires Copyright The Associated Press All Rights Reserved LOS ANGELES AP During the peak of the states power crisis the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power earned far greater profits selling electricity to the rest of the state than agency officials previously acknowledged it was reported Monday DWP officials have insisted for months that the agency sold power for just percent above its costs In fact the DWPs profits from electricity sales to powerstarved areas of the state averaged percent last year according to a newly completed audit obtained by the Los Angeles Times under the California Public Records Act The finding will likely reinforce charges by some consumer advocates that the public power company effectively helped its customers at the expense of those suffering blackouts and rate hikes The audit may also undercut efforts by Gov Gray Davis and others to blame rising energy costs on private outofstate generating companies The audit was ordered in May by the DWPs new general manager David Wiggs It was conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and targeted a month period beginning in May The DWP became a key player in the energy crisis last year when the states deregulation of electricity began to backfire with supply from private generators contracting and wholesale prices skyrocketing The DWP which had opted out of deregulation cranked up its generating capacity and sold the extra electricity into the California market helping to avert even more blackouts At the same time though the DWP and other publicly owned utilities charged some of the highest prices during the crisis official reports later showed Records show that during the worst months of the crisis ending in May the DWP profited million on sales of million the Times said The agency says it is still owed million In an interview with the Times last week former DWP chief S David Freeman who now heads Davis new statewide power authority insisted that he had issued standing orders to sell power at a profit of no more than percent Freeman made the same assurance in July in a letter to US senators probing the energy meltdown He told the Times he has not seen the audit but said if profits were higher than percent then Im not embarrassed about it It says nothing more than theres enterprise at the DWP Wiggs said that his staff had found no documentation as of Friday to confirm the existence of a strict pricing policy during Freemans tenure but he said that even if the profit margin was higher than publicly stated it was not excessive We charged just and reasonable rates Wiggs told the Times adding that the DWP now offers the state electricity with no profit margin But for consumersrights activists the findings were new ammunition Taking advantage of residents in one part of the state to benefit residents in another part is not fair said Harry Snyder senior advocate for Consumers Union the nonprofit that publishes Consumer Reports This kind of behavior is what we expect from banks savings and loans and insurance companies not a public agency Natural Gas Bills Will Decrease for California Utility Customers Bruce Spence KRTBN KnightRidder Tribune Business News The Record Stockton California Copyright C KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News Source World Reporter TM PGE residential customers will see this months natural gas bills drop on average by nearly a third from a year ago when supplies were short and market prices were zooming Supplies are up and prices are down now because drillers went at it last winter trying to take advantage of high market prices After a January price spike prices have since declined nearly to the level of two winters ago said Christy Dennis Pacific Gas Electric spokeswoman Although there was such a shortage of natural gas last winter that there were threats of service cuts supplies for this winter should be ample she said We are in much better shape this year than we were last year Dennis said The naturalgas industry reports that falling prices promise to push some drillers out of the market again But if youre talking about this winter its a sunny picture said Laurie Cramer spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association in Washington DC Production is up even if prices are down Perhaps most important she added We dont expect the kind of volatile market we had last year From August gas prices rose from less than per thousand cubic feet to by the beginning of this and have since fallen to under Dennis said that in September the average PGE residential natural gas customer using therms of gas during a day cycle paid for the natural gas portion of the gas bill This month that same therms will cost a nearly percent drop from a year ago she said The big question of course is the outlook for the heart of winter The utility isnt speculating because demand and thus supplies can be unsettled by an unusually cold winter But the gas market trend points to only a slight increase from now through the heavy cold months as naturalgas consumption rises Dennis said In January residential customers use about therms of gas In January the bill for that was about Last January averaged Dennis said Elizabeth Field has both a gas stove and water heater in her Stockton home and she said she was delighted to hear that her gas bill should be down from last winter My natural gas bill doubled over the winter she said Between gasoline prices for the car and my PGE bill it was a big deal Sam Baygi owner of El Dorado Florist N El Dorado St said that higher gas prices didnt really seem to hit him hard over the winter The important factor at his shop is to keep the flowers cool anyway And at home his gas costs seemed up maybe slightly he recalled but all in all he didnt feel pounded I dont think it was so big of a deal Dennis said supplies should be sufficient for PGEs million natural gas customers despite that many of the usual suppliers quit doing business with PGE because of the utilitys bankruptcy proceedings and credit poundinge The utilitys financial woes began last summer when spotmarket spikes for electricity produced high power prices that PGE had to pay to try to keep the power on in California The national naturalgas association is three weeks away from finishing its tabulation of production numbers and forecasting winter supplies But Cramer said naturalgas producers still face many of the same challenges they faced last year such as a shortage of workers and equipment Also some of the biggest discovered naturalgas reserves in the Rocky Mountains region and in the Gulf of Mexico remain untapped because of government restrictions Theres still a lot offlimits to producers Cramer said Also about twothirds of drillers are small momandpop type operations that can be driven out of production by low prices she said Its a capitalintense industry and they usually dont have a lot of capital Scottish Power Sets Million Charge for ExcessPower Costs at US Unit Dow Jones Business News Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc Dow Jones Newswires LONDON Scottish Power PLC faced a new setback Monday after the company said it will take a million charge in the second quarter for additional excesspower costs at its PacifiCorp unit in the US The United Kingdombased utility said the charge will reduce the contribution of PacifiCorp to Scottish Powers earnings for the year to March by around nine pence US cents or European cents a share or The announcement of the charge which Scottish Power SPI said was linked to extreme volatility in US forward electricity markets knocked the companys shares In midday trading in London Scottish Power declined to pence The news couldnt have come at a worse time for the beleaguered UK utility which was just beginning to recover from the effects of last years sixmonth outage at its Utah Hunter power plant The outage which forced Scottish Power to buy power on western US wholesale markets overheated by the California energy crisis contributed to million in excesspower costs the company reported for its latest fiscal year which ended March In an effort to avoid exposing itself anew to unprecedented price spikes which were forecast to continue through the end of Scottish Power overcompensated in its forward contracts leading to the new million charge the company said All we are doing is making sure PacifiCorp has sufficient power to meet its regulatory obligations Chief Executive Ian Russell said Monday The difficult thing is that when we bought that power to meet regulatory supply obligations we were buying at a price that is over ten times what it is today A combination of lower demand more capacity price caps and coolerthanexpected summer weather have led to a collapse in US prices to around per megawatthour currently from an average of more than per megawatthour in the first quarter the company said Scottish Power will seek recovery of the excess charges from US regulators in the months to come Mr Russell said The company is also reviewing its riskmanagement policies The new charges draw a line under the episode that started last winter with this spike in prices Mr Russell said ABN Amro analyst Alistair Buchanan said market was shocked by the announcement and that investors will want to know why they werent warned earlier On the brighter side Mr Russell and Chief Financial Officer David Nish noted that the company last week won a million revenue increase from regulators in the state of Oregon most of which is related to increased power costs Although the tariff increase was only of the million the company was seeking Mr Nish said the company was encouraged by the regulators agreement to allow PacifiCorp to defer compliance with the new Oregon baseline power cost in tariffs until May The agreement also allows PacifiCorp to propose a permanent powercost recovery mechanism he added The company is expecting a decision from Utah regulators on a separate million tariffincrease request in the next couple of days The Oregon rate decision is a positive one for Scottish Power analysts said but several said it will be overshadowed by the million charge which is far higher than the million in excess costs some were expecting this year The most important thing is that the time at which they said they will get acceptable rates of interest from this business PacifiCorp hasnt changed said Gareth

an invoice from the California Independent System Operator for power purchased on behalf of the states insolvent utilities DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said Friday Between the middle of January when Gov Gray Davis ordered the DWR to start paying for ISO power purchases and May the ISO has procured about billion in power on behalf of California s cashstrapped utilities PGE Corps PCG Pacific Gas

that we can account for we cant write a blank check and send it out We havent even received an improper bill said Hidalgo The ISO was unable to comment immediately on whether it has sent a bill to the DWR for power purchased on behalf of the utilities The ISO has said previously that it cant supply all the information the DWR wants without violating its own confidentiality rules The Independent Energy Producers Association which represents many of the suppliers to the ISO said this week the ISO market is on the verge of collapsing Merchant power companies in California such as Dynegy Inc DYN and Mirant Corp MIR continue to sell to the ISO as ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO which has ultimate responsibility for avoiding blackouts ensures there is exactly the right amount of power on the states transmission lines to meet demand at all times which requires constant buying and selling of electricity In midJanuary after the states two main utilities ran out of cash an executive order from Davis backed by state law passed in February authorized the DWR to pay for any purchases the ISO needed to make for the utilities There is no bill I dont know as a government agency how the process of payment for a significant amount of money over billion would be in anybodys mind as a possibility Hidalgo said The DWR which has paid more than billion for power it has bought from suppliers directly since January has set aside money to pay for the ISOs lastminute purchases The ISO considers the entire billion unpaid though DWR operations chief Pete Garris said earlier this week that DWR may have paid a majority of that bill directly to power suppliers The DWR has set aside about billion to pay suppliers once it receives a detailed bill from the ISO that meets DWR requirements Other procedural problems have prevented the DWR from making payment The DWR wants to pay suppliers directly which Garris said the ISO is uncomfortable with The ISO declined to discuss this directpayment issue ISO market rules require that buyers pay the ISO which in turn pays sellers The FERC has ordered the ISO to stop buying power on behalf on parties that arent creditworthy specifically Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison PGE has said that it continues to receive bills from the ISO and has been told the bills are for informational purposes only By Mark Golden Dow Jones Newswires Shocking facts about deregulation Linda McQuaig National Post National Page C c National Post All Rights Reserved Among the many things one might want to do in the privacy of ones own home late at night checking out electricity prices may not be high on the list Yet oddly enough this appears to be one of the main selling features of the Harris governments plan to deregulate the Ontario electricity market next year Once electricity is deregulated the price of a kilowatt of energy will change by the minute with prices posted on the Internet every hour Really keen consumers who dont want to wait a whole agonizing hour can have meters installed right in their homes So for instance if the price per kilowatt hour hits rock bottom at am these wellequipped folk wont have to wait until the top of the hour to shove the laundry into the washing machine turn on the dishwasher and get out the vacuum cleaner This is all part of what deregulation enthusiasts like John Grant an economist who has been involved in the provincial deregulation plans see as the empowerment consumers will enjoy under deregulation Well I certainly wouldnt want to underestimate the pleasure of being able to select the perfect time to maximize ones electricity consumption but will it be enough to compensate for the higher prices that will almost certainly accompany this deregulation We know deregulation produced dramatically higher electricity prices in Alberta and California In Alberta prices rose to five times previous levels last winter in California power costs surged at times to levels above normal Supporters of deregulation prefer to look at what has happened elsewhere Michael Trebilcock a University of Toronto law professor and longtime pusher of electricity deregulation points to deregulation in Australia and the UK where he says electricity prices fell by to Maybe Im missing something here but it sounds like what were faced with is a bestcase scenario under which deregulation saves us possibly to off our power bills Wow The worstcase scenario however involves us paying amounts that are potentially staggering If we do things as badly as California we could see increases from time to time in the range Vacuuming could become not only an exclusively latenight pleasure but a luxury we can only dream of Dont the odds seem to be stacked against us on this one It seems a bit like agreeing to a coin toss Heads you win cents tails you lose But lets go for it And in case it sounds like Im distorting things it should be noted that this is essentially the picture presented by advocates of deregulation Trebilcock for instance doesnt argue that the savings will be big only that there may be some savings as there were in Australia and the UK In a recent presentation to the Institute for Policy Analysis in Toronto Trebilcock acknowledged that the adverse experiences in jurisdictions like California and Alberta made him nervous But in any event he wasnt sure it was possible at this stage in Ontario to put the genie back in the bottle Hows that for a ringing endorsement from one of deregulations leading proponents Meanwhile Myron Gordon a professor of finance at U of Ts Rotman School of Management argues that the Ontario deregulation will be a complete disaster not just for consumers but for the Canadian business community Gordon insists that surging unpredictable electricity costs will strip Ontario industries of the competitive advantage theyve long enjoyed over their counterparts in neighbouring US states Gordon scoffs at the notion that there might be price savings He notes that once our electricity is deregulated it will be subject to the rules of NAFTA Under NAFTA we cant withhold energy supplies from US customers or charge them more than we charge ourselves so electricity shortages in the United States will push our prices here up to US levels Better do the vacuuming now What makes all this infuriating is that Gordon insists that if we just left things as they are with a regulated price in a regulated market we could keep our prices below the United States while covering the full cost of generating the electricity we need and having some supply left over for profitable export This is pretty much what BC has opted to do Its not surprising then that deregulation aficionados are pushing things other than price savings to get the public excited about this bold venture into the new economy John Grant likes to emphasize the huge array of consumer choice that lies ahead Consumers will be able to choose electricity packages that also include long distance telephone and Internet service theyll be free to choose between Standard Supply where the wholesale price of energy will be passed through to them and they may be entitled to a rebate or instead opt for whatever deal is offered by their distributor Or they can choose to deal directly with a retailer who offers fixed prices for a year or more or another who will install a meter in their home so they can track minutebyminute price fluctuations Not that life will be problemfree in this consumer nirvana Grant poses the question If consumers sign up to a retailers fixed price offer and sign away their right to a possible rebate do they know what they have given up Clearly lots to talk about around the water cooler or over a cold beer after work Its hard to imagine what people did late at night before there was a new economy Commentary Bailout Scheme for Edison Fails Tests Again WILLIAM BRADLEY Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page B Copyright The Times Mirror Company At a late night session Thursday the California Assembly emulated its deregulation forebears narrowly adopting another complex halfunderstood energy bill from the back rooms There are many problems with the proposed state bailout of Southern California Edison Here are the most fundamental The bailout is much bigger than advertised Backers including Gov Gray Davis parent company Edison International and some Los Angeles progressives advertise it as a billion deal In reality when interest on bonds and other benefits are added in it will cost closer to twice as much Tangible assets for the public once central to the deal have been stripped from it The Edison rescue was to center on the states acquisition of the utilitys transmission lines Ownership of the grid would have given the state leverage it has lacked over power generators and state ownership would make critically needed upgrades cheaper to finance This fell away when Pacific Gas Electric declared bankruptcy this spring taking a huge chunk of the private grid off the market While some Sierra lands receive protection from development the state gains no ownership Coastal and desert lands are unprotected Edison already has received three state bailouts First it along with the other big private utilities received billions in a bailout of stranded assets most notably nuclear that was part of the deregulation deal It received billions more as part of the abovemarket consumer rates locked in by the deregulation dealuntil companies that bought the power plants Edison cleverly sold them turned the screws last year These funds enabled Edison International to run a highflying global merchant power operation Then Edison received a third bailout earlier this year when the state spent billion to replace power lost from the troubled San Onofre nuclear plant Edison is hypocritical in coming to the Capitol with its hand out yet again especially given its central role in pushing through the deregulation scheme from which it now wants to be rescued Edison International CEO John E Bryson trades on his past progressive status as a Natural Resources Defense Council cofounder to distract from reality When Gov Pete Wilson signed deregulation into law Bryson called it a great day for us Yet even with the billions Edison has gotten in previous bailouts a state rescue effort might be justified were the process not so remarkably compromised Davis sent Michael R Peevey a former Southern California Edison president to represent the state in negotiations with Edison Not surprisingly this led to a generous deal for the company with the state negotiating for things that the state Public Utilities Commission could have required the company to do anyway Although that deal died what is now on the table is fatally flawed by the sweetheart deal template from which it sprang So eager is Davis to bail out Edison that he would allow big business customers to cut their own private power contracts This could leave the rest of us holding the bag on his hugely expensive longterm power contracts Perhaps worst of all is the tremendous distraction caused by the months of maneuvering to save Edison from its own miscalculations As we emerge from panic mode California has serious problems including a new crazyquilt of state energy agencies and longterm power contracts that perpetrate a green blackout ignoring renewable energy in favor of a new generation of fossil fuel plants The situation would have been far more rational and efficient had everyone involved not had to waste inordinate amounts of time dealing with the special pleadings of one privileged corporation Enough PGE DISPUTES COST SHIFT THE AGENCY THAT BUYS STATE UTILITIES ELECTRICITY HAD ASKED REGULATORS TO APPROVE UNIFORM RATES BUT PLAN IS UNDER REVIEW MIKE TAUGHER TIMES STAFF WRITER Contra Costa Times Walnut Creek CA Final Page a c Copyright Contra Costa Times All Rights Reserved SAN FRANCISCO A plan to shift million in electricity costs from Southern California to Pacific Gas Electric Co came under heavy fire Wednesday when the San Franciscobased utility launched a media campaign to oppose the plan and Northern California lawmakers blasted it as potentially illegal Even if it costs the state more to buy power in the north it is doubtful that the differences are enough to justify such a large transfer of costs according to a letter signed by of the Northern California members of the Assembly At issue is how the state Department of Water Resources which has been buying electricity for financially strapped utilities since January will be repaid for its electricity purchases this year and next The agency had asked state regulators to approve a uniform price tag of cents for each kilowatthour it sells to utility customers But under the plan now being considered by the Public Utilities Commission PGE customers would pay cents per kilowatthour through next May while customers of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric would pay cents and cents respectively This appears to be an unsubstantiated and illegal cost shift to Northern California customers lawmakers wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to PUC President Loretta Lynch The PUC had planned to consider the issue today but it is among several items that have been delayed for as long as two weeks as the commission struggles to issue regulations needed to allow the state to borrow more than billion on the bond market Lynch said linking the price of electricity to the actual cost to the state of providing it instead of spreading out the toll that the electricity crisis has exacted on California equally is consistent with the way the commission has traditionally imposed rates That is the methodology the commission has used for decades Lynch said It would be discriminatory to have Edison customers and SDGE customers subsidize PGE customers Still Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla DPittsburg said that unless the plan is modified Northern California lawmakers might block legislation designed to keep SoCal Edison out of bankruptcy That legislation which could come to the Assembly floor as early as today has been a key part of Gov Gray Davis strategy to navigate California out of the electricity crisis I dont know how anyone in the north is going to be able to justify voting for a bailout for Edison that shifts any of these costs onto PGE customers directly or indirectly Canciamilla said According to Canciamilla relieving SoCal Edison of hundreds of millions of costs for statepurchased power could help the Southern California utility finance billion in debts to generators which in turn would help make the bailout plan work I dont think the real motivation is retribution against PGE for defying Davis by declaring voluntary bankruptcy in April as much as it is trying to figure out a way to assist in making a bailout of SoCal Edison work Canciamilla said Meanwhile PGE took out radio spots and ads in three newspapers Wednesday urging customers to complain to the PUC about the plan The commission substantially changed the formula and as a result our customers would be forced to pay more said PGE spokesman Ron Low That claim is mostly true but potentially misleading PGEs customers would pay more for the electricity purchased by the state but whether that would lead to a higher overall electricity bill is not clear That is because the PUC has yet to determine how much PGE should earn on electricity generated at the plants it still owns If PGE is allowed to earn relatively little then no rate increase would be needed But if the sum of the rate collected by DWR and the rate collected by PGE exceeds what customers are paying now then another rate hike could occur The PUCs Lynch who assured reporters this spring that no rate hikes would be needed after the commission approved increases totaling cents per kilowatthour this year was noncommittal Wednesday about the possibility of a further increase for PGE customers Paul Clanon head of the PUCs energy division said the likelihood of a rate increase for PGE customers would become clearer near the end of the month when drafts begin circulating to address the rate that PGE may collect PUC officials did say however that no rate hike would hit customers of Southern California utilities State officials say it costs far more to provide power in the north because the state has to buy more electricity to serve Northern California and there is comparatively less electricity available in the northern part of state and in the Pacific Northwest That pinch between supply and demand is exacerbated by transmission constraints that make it more difficult to bring electricity up from Southern California according to DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo The state supplies about percent of the electricity used by PGE customers with the rest being generated at PGE plants or under existing contracts especially with alternative energy generators CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SEEKS PROBE OF POWER CUTBACK Bloomberg News The Arizona Republic Final Chaser Page D Copyright c The Arizona Republic California Secretary of State Bill Jones plans to ask federal regulators to investigate allegations that officials colluded to reduce output at a power plant to save the state money on energy trading Jones plans to seek the Republican nomination to challenge Gov Gray Davis in next years gubernatorial campaign He will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to start an investigation said Beth Pendexter a spokeswoman for Jones The probe would focus on why a state agency may have ordered Edison Internationals utility to reduce output at a plant in Nevada The state Department of Water Resources would be a target of the investigation Pendexter said The department may have sought to slow production at the Mojave power plant she said Because the state buys power at higher prices in longterm contracts it loses money when it has to sell electricity cheaply during a time of excess supply The Department of Water Resources has spent almost billion buying electricity for PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric and Edisons Southern California Edison which are insolvent after running up billions in debts under the states deregulation law The department has signed about billion in longterm energy contracts The State Davis Upbeat on Billion Edison Plan Energy Governor is optimistic that Senate Assembly versions can be reconciled and a bill sent to him next week before session ends MIGUEL BUSTILLO NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page B Copyright The Times Mirror Company SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis expressed optimism Friday that a billion plan to try to restore Southern California Edison to financial health will reach his desk before next Friday when legislators adjourn for the year A day after the state Assembly narrowly approved the measure the Democratic governor said that although it still needs to be reconciled with a slightly different version approved earlier by the Senate he is confident the bill will clear the Legislature Im hopeful that we get the rescue plan ratified by a week from today the last day of the session Davis said Friday during a breakfast meeting in Sacramento I think thats entirely doable now since its passed both houses albeit in different forms Our goal will be to get that done before the Legislature recesses Davis optimism contrasted with angry words from consumer activists who oppose the bill as a bailout of Edison Is this the best deal the Assembly can get from a company that claims to be desperately in need of help said Mike Florio senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco It reads as if the same scoundrels that led the Legislature into deregulationthe utilities and the large commercial customersare still running the show Edison executives offered a subdued response during a conference call with investors Friday maintaining that the road to restoring the companys finances in the Capitol remains long This is another step in the trail said Theodore Craver Jr chief financial officer of Edison International parent company of the Rosemeadbased utility We obviously have a long way to go yet in terms of additional steps at the Senate but its good to see some momentum there The bill SB xx by Sen Richard Polanco DLos Angeles is a slimmeddown version of a rescue deal Davis reached with the debtstrapped utility this spring to keep it out of bankruptcy It has cleared both houses but still needs final approval in the Senate where Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco plans to take several days to review the changes made in the Assembly to determine whether the measure is viable In many ways the two versions are alike Both would allow the utility to float bonds that would be used to repay about threefourths of the billion debt Edison incurred purchasing electricity during the early days of the energy crisis Edison bought the power on the volatile open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a stateimposed rate freeze Edison would be permitted to use the money to pay back most of its creditorsbanks and small alternative energy producers Both bills would bar Edison from using the money to repay large energy companies which Democratic legislators accuse of gouging the state during the crisis The utility would be on its own to pay or negotiate the billion it owes those companies Under the Assembly version the bonds would be paid off by about of Edisons large and midsized business customers those that use kilowatts and up Under the Senate version a smaller number of the largest businesses would foot the tab Under both bills residential customers and most small businesses would be spared Supporters of the bill say that neither version would require an additional increase in electricity bills Opponents question that assertion Because the company would still have sizable debts even if the bill passes Edison representatives say they cannot guarantee they will not wind up in bankruptcy Robert Foster Edison Internationals executive vice president of external affairs told investors Friday that the bill still leaves Southern California Edison at risk Nevertheless we are encouraged by the progress made by the Assembly toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness Foster said In both plans Edison would also agree not to pursue a series of lawsuits and legal claims against the state Pacific Gas Electric the states largest utility has filed suit against the state charging that the rate freeze illegally prohibited the company from recovering its costs of providing power to customers Both bills also would give the state conservation rights to acres of mostly wilderness land near Edisons hydroelectric power reservoirs The original rescue deal from last spring hinged on the state purchasing Edisons power grid Some legislators and consumer activists said the grid could be upgraded with public financing to improve the distribution of power and prevent the likelihood of blackouts But legislators have questioned the value of owning a third of the states power linesthe share controlled by Edisonand the bills minimize the grid acquisition Under the Senate plan the state would have an option to purchase the lines at billion or book value less than half what Davis initially proposed The Assembly plan would give the state a similar option requiring further action by the Legislature before it could be exercised The Assembly bill would pay the utility twice book value or fair market price whichever was lower The Assembly and Senate versions contain provisions that would allow businesses to pursue direct access contracts to buy electricity from energy companies instead of from the utility Participating businesses would have to pay an exit fee of sorts to cover their share of the utilitys debt bonds Power Politics in the Senate The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company This has not been a good year for clear thinking about energy First came the CheneyBush national energy strategy which presupposed that the country was in the grips of a terrible energy shortage and that the only sure way to address it was to drill aggressively for more oil and gas remove various regulatory impediments to the burning of coal and build new power plants The House of Representatives swallowed the CheneyBush scenario whole and produced an alarmingly unbalanced energy bill with billion in tax breaks billion for traditional energy producers only billion for conservation The Senate must now set things right presumably at lower cost even the Bush administration was appalled by the Houses price tag What this country wants is an energy policy that encourages oil and gas exploration without corrupting the environment finds more efficient ways to use the energy we have and begins planning for the day when the fossil fuels we take for granted are less abundant at home or abroad This will not be an easy task energy politics gets nasty and local in a hurry In the House for example many normally reliable friends of the environment voted in favor of opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the oil companies and against increasing fuel economy standards because they were terrified of retaliation from organized labor if they did otherwise This is a rare chance for the Senate to exercise statesmanship while reaping political rewards as well Polls show that the two issues on which President Bush is most vulnerable are energy and the environment The Senate cannot lose if it produces a plan more balanced and enlightened than his It will be up to Jeff Bingaman the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to devise such a plan Then Tom Daschle the Senate majority leader must sell it to his colleagues There are three areas where the House bill requires complete overhaul Improving Efficiency The House bill dedicates billion in various subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy versus about billion for the coal oil and gas industries It creates modest tax credits for people who buy hybrid cars for builders of more energyefficient homes and for manufacturers of some energysaving appliances But it does nothing to improve the efficiency of one of the biggest energy users of all airconditioners and it is here that the Senate could usefully resurrect the tough standards imposed by the Clinton administration that President Bush is trying to roll back The most important and courageous step however and one the House refused to take would be to close the socalled SUV loophole under which large vehicles like sport utility vehicles and minivans are classified as light trucks and thus escape the milepergallon standard required of ordinary cars Closing that loophole which Detroit is perfectly capable of doing would result in oil savings of one million barrels a day by more than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could be expected to yield in the same time frame Increasing Supply At the heart of the House bill is a proposal to open up the refuges coastal plain to oil exploration That would yield only six months to a years worth of oil even at favorable prices while disrupting an ecological treasure Industry assertions that drilling would create new jobs have been widely discredited There are other steps the committee can take to increase supply One is to see whether there is an environmentally safe way of tapping and transporting the vast supplies of natural gas at Alaskas Prudhoe Bay where the oil industry is already firmly ensconced Such a scheme would be expensive and in some quarters controversial but it makes a lot more sense than invading the refuge the national forests the Rocky Mountain Front and other sensitive areas on which the oil industry and the Cheney task force have cast a covetous eye Improving Reliability The House was so fixated on subsidizing traditional energy producers including the coalfired utilities that it paid no attention to the way electricity is regulated and transported That was a huge oversight that Mr Bingaman says he intends to remedy As the nowreceding California crisis demonstrated electricity deregulation has not gone smoothly There are transmission problems in the West and Northeast Power does not move easily from one region to another and the system is full of disincentives that discourage smaller and potentially more efficient producers of power from entering the market None of this will come easy for Mr Bingaman and Mr Daschle They must resist President Bushs seductive and specious argument that opening up new areas for oil and gas drilling and easing environmental regulations will provide an immediate economic boost And powerful corporate and labor forces are arrayed against them But the nation would like them to give it their best shot A SelfInflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over Enron By ALEX BERENSON The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SOMETHING is rotten with the state of Enron Or so Wall Street suspects On Jan shares in Enron the giant energy trading company in Houston stood at On Friday Enron closed at down percent for the week and percent for the year The slide has destroyed more than billion in shareholder value In part the companys problems are beyond its control a result of the collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming glut in electricity But the deepest wound at Enron is selfinflicted Heavy insider selling indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap between the company and Wall Street The stock is trading under a cloud says James S Chanos the president of Kynikos Associates a hedge fund in New York Mr Chanos began betting against Enron early this year and says he thinks that the companys shares remain overvalued Enrons problems came to a head on Aug when it announced that Jeffrey K Skilling the chief executive had quit for personal reasons With his resignation Mr Skilling joined a halfdozen other top Enron managers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities Still the news came as a surprise because Mr Skilling was named to his post only in February Under the best of circumstances the unexpected departure of a chief executive rattles Wall Street But hardheaded investors can usually comfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearly departed poohbah has left behind Executives come and go but numbers are forever Unfortunately Enrons books offer investors little succor The complexity of the companys businesses and the way it reports its results make understanding Enrons financial statements essentially impossible Over the last decade Enron has transformed itself from a simple natural gas pipeline company into the worlds largest trader of electricity and gas Last year about threequarters of the companys cash flow came out of the companys wholesale services division which includes its trading operations But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes Are they shortterm or longterm Is the company hedged or does it make directional bets on the prices of the commodities it trades The answers are crucial because they determine how much risk Enron has taken to make its money Big profits are nice Big profits that come from big risky trades are a recipe for big unexpected writeoffs Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely related companies in related party transactions The company says that the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that they have been approved by its board and outside auditors But relatedparty deals can provide a convenient way for public companies to shift losses to private affiliates And Enrons disclosure about its relatedparty deals including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a partnership that until recently was controlled by the companys chief financial officer is notably sketchy In the good old days like last year companies could get away with the unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks as long as their revenue and profit numbers looked good But Wall Street has become more demanding as Enron is learning to its chagrin Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron says the company is aware of investors concerns Weve got credibility issues on the street no question Mr Palmer says Were looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more information Sooner would be better than later
