Thursday February AM To Subject FW wwwwashtimescom EnronClinton ties Original Message From Knoblauh Jay Sent Thursday February AM To Subject wwwwashtimescom EnronClinton ties has sent you an article from The Washington Times CLINTON HELPED ENRON FINANCE PROJECTS ABROAD Patrice Hill THE WASHINGTON TIMES The Clinton administration provided more than billion in subsidized loans to Enron Corp projects overseas at a time when Enron was contributing nearly million to Democratic causes Clinton officials refused to finance only one out of projects proposed by the energy company between and to build power plants naturalgas pipelines and other bigticket energy facilities around the world according to the ExportImport Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp the agencies that provided the subsidies In addition the administration which lauded Chairman Kenneth L Lay as an exemplary corporate citizen granted about million worth of insurance against political risks for nine Enron projects in such politically volatile areas as Argentina Venezuela and the Gaza Strip according to documents the agencies provided to the Senate Finance Committee These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enrons operations said Sen Charles E Grassley Iowa Republican and ranking minority member of the committee He noted that the Reagan and Bush administrations approved no loans for Enron between and and provided insurance for only one Enron power project in Guatemala in The Clinton administration provided three loans between and to the nowdefunct Dabhol power project in India Mr Clintons commerce secretary Ron Brown trumpeted the approval of the Dabhol loans on a trade mission to India in with Mr Lay by his side The trip was one of Clinton trade missions provided at taxpayer expense for corporate executives from Enron and other companies The US Trade and Development Agency which sponsored the trips also provided million in funding to study Enron energy projects in Russia Eastern Europe and former Soviet states As congressional committees dig for evidence to tie Enron and Mr Lay to the Bush administration evidence of Mr Lays links to the Clinton administration are ample and welldocumented Mr Lay at times was Mr Clintons golf partner and slept in the Lincoln Bedroom Other top Enron officials attended the White Houses infamous coffee klatches with Mr Clinton according to published reports Mr Lay offered a seat on Enrons board of directors to Robert E Rubin Mr Clintons Treasury secretary in just before he left government the Associated Press reported yesterday Mr Rubin tried to get Treasury to intervene on behalf of Enron last fall when the company credit rating was threatened In May Mr Clinton lauded Mr Lay as a good corporate citizen at a White House event because of Enrons enlightened personnel policies including profitsharing of Enron stock and generous health and pension benefits Enron employees now are suing because those benefits are as worthless as the bankrupt companys stock During the Clinton years Enron contributed more than million to the Democratic Party including to the Democatic National Committee according to Federal Election Commission records Mr Clinton and Vice President Al Gore received contributions of and respectively for their presidential campaigns One contribution to the DNC was provided before India gave final approval to Enrons Dabhol project in June The largest and most expensive capital project ever undertaken in India Dabhol was of dubious economic value and never went on line The World Bank on reviewing the project said it was not economically viable and inordinately benefited Enron which was a percent owner Enron still owes million on an ExportImport Bank loan for the project which the bank says is covered by guarantees provided by five Indian banks Congressional aides said it is not clear what the taxpayers liability will be for that and other loans now that Enron is bankrupt The ExportImport Bank said its loans were extended to overseas subsidiaries of Enron and not the bankrupt corporation The overseas investment agency said its exposure is limited to paying any missed premiums on Enrons political risk insurance Top Clinton officials lobbied personally to obtain Indian state guarantees for the Dabhol project after it encountered early problems in Thomas F Mack McLarty the White House chief of staff made it a top administration priority to keep the project from failing The Bush administration has continued efforts to salvage the project Clinton Energy Secretary Hazel OLeary led a succession of missions to India and Mr Clintons ambassador to India Frank Wisner was charged with keeping the project afloat After Mr Wisner left government in he took a seat on the board of directors of a company then controlled by Enron Mr McLarty also performed work for Enron after leaving the administration This article was mailed from The Washington Times

Letter to Enrons Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive ollowing is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to Kenneth L Lay the chairman of the Enron Corporation newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcusto mnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbENRNQ after Jeffrey K Skilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug Its author was later identified as Sherron S Watkins a vice president for corporate development at Enron The House Energy and Commerce Committee released excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday Has Enron become a risky place to work For those of us who didnt get rich over the last few years can we afford to stay Skillings abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues Enron has been very aggressive in its accounting most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly some of our EES MTM positions The spotlight will be on us the market just cant accept that Skilling is leaving his dream job I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and reported with other good will writedowns to occur in How do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals They unwind in and we will have to pony up Enron stock and that wont go unnoticed To the layman on the street it will look like we recognized funds flow of million from merchant asset sales in by selling to a vehicle Condor that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later years Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance We have recognized over million of fair value gains on stocks via our swaps with Raptor Much of that stock has declined significantly Avici by percent from million to million the New Power Company by percent from a share to a share The value in the swaps wont be there for Raptor so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these losses Raptor is an LJM entity It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my rsum the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax Skilling is resigning now for personal reasons but I would think he wasnt having fun looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years Is there a way our accounting gurus can unwind these deals now I have thought and thought about a way to do this but I keep bumping into one big problem we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in and we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price many executives sold stock we then try and reverse or fix the deals in and its a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later Nice try but investors were hurt they bought at and a share looking for a share and now theyre at or worse We are under too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled redeployed employees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us in trouble What do we do I know this question cannot be addressed in the allemployee meeting but can you give some assurances that you and Causey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to happen to Condor and Raptor in and Summary of Alleged Issues RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity That equity is at risk however the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected there is no commitment to contribute more equity The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of Enron NP restricted stock and stock rights Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold As disclosed in we recognized million of revenue from the equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying securities This year with the value of our stock declining the underlying capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing for reserves against our MTM positions To avoid such a writedown or reserve in quarter one we enhanced the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles committing more ENE shares My understanding of the thirdquarter problem is that we must enhance the vehicles by million I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a lot of accountants including AA Co have blessed the accounting treatment None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day Please review the late s problems of Waste Management newsquote redirectmarketwatchredirectctxMWcusto mnytcomhtmlcompanyprofileaspsymbWMI where AA paid million plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the accounting treatment to a man in the street would you influence his investing decisions Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough understanding of the facts If so you best present it correctly andor change the accounting My concern is that the footnotes dont adequately explain the transactions If adequately explained the investor would know that the entities described in our related party footnote are thinly capitalized the equity holders have no skin in the game and all the value in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives unfortunately in this case a big loss AND Enron stock and NP Looking at the stock we swapped I also dont believe any other company would have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron In other words the million in revenue in would have been much lower How much lower Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well then no one would be the wiser If Enron stock did well the stock issuance to these entities would decline and the transactions would be less noticeable All has gone against us The stocks most notably Hanover the New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities law and accounting I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two courses of action The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage too great therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse unwind write down these positionstransactions The probability of discovery is too great the estimated damages to the company too great therefore we must quantify develop damage containment plans and disclose I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly increased with Skillings shocking departure Too many people are looking for a smoking gun Summary of Raptor Oddities The accounting treatment looks questionable a Enron booked a million gain from equity derivatives from a related party b That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except Enron c It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a contribution of its own shares One basic question The related party entity has lost million in its equity derivative transactions with Enron Who bears that loss I cant find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss Find out who will lose this money Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity If its Enron from our shares then I think we do not have a fact pattern that would look good to the SEC or investors The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length a Enron hedged New Power Hanover and Avici with the related party at what now appears to be the peak of the market New Power and Avici have fallen away significantly since The related party was unable to lay off this risk This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron b I dont think any other unrelated company would have entered into these transactions at these prices What else is going on here What was the compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such transactions There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor Employees question our accounting propriety consistently and constantly This alone is cause for concern a Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer Three days later Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him b Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM c I have heard one managerlevel employee from the principal investments group say I know it would be devastating to all of us but I wish we would get caught Were such a crooked company The principal investments group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor These people know and see a lot Many similar comments are made when you ask about these deals Employees quote our CFO as saying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money trail between Enron and LJMRaptor and its principals Can he look at LJM At Raptor If the CFO says no isnt that a problem Condor and Raptor Work Postpone decision on filling office of the chair if the current decision includes CFO andor CAO Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorneyclient privilege on the work product Cant use V E due to conflict they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals Law firm to hire one of the big but not Arthur Andersen or PricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest AA Co Enron PWC LJM Investigate the transactions our accounting treatment and our future commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock NP etc For instance In the third quarter we have a million problem with Raptor NPW if we dont enhance the capital structure of Raptor to commit more ENE shares By the way in Q we enhanced the Raptor deal committing more ENE shares to avoid a writedown Develop cleanup plan a Best case Clean up quietly if possible b Worst case Quantify develop PR and IR campaigns customer assurance plans dont want to go the way of Salomons trading shop legal actions severance actions disclosure Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if Im all wet a Jeff McMahon b Mark Koenig c Rick Buy d Greg Walley To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following Weve contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities Since its contingent we have the consideration given and received at zero We do as Causey points out include the shares in our fully diluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future This impacts earningsper share projections only We lost value in several equity investments in million of lost value These were fairvalue investments we wrote them down However we also booked gains from our price risk management transactions with Raptor recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from the Raptor entities Thats a million related party transaction its percent of IBIT percent of NI pretax percent of NI after tax Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor reviews the contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will have enough capital to pay Enron its million when the equity derivatives expire The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt the value of the contingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable that Raptor owes Enron Raptors inceptiontodate income statement is a million loss Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out LJM is whole on a cashon cash basis Where did the million in value come from It came from Enron shares Why havent we booked the transaction as million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and million of value in our economic interests in these entities Then we would have a writedown of our value in the Raptor entities We have not booked the latter because we do not have to yet Technically we can wait and face the music in The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions Dont you think that several interested companies be they stock analysts journalists hedge fund managers etc are busy trying to discover the reason Skilling left Dont you think their smartest people are poring over that footnote disclosure right now I can just hear the discussions it looks like they booked a million gain from this related party company and I think from all the undecipherable halfpage on Enrons contingent contributions to this related party entity I think the related party entity is capitalized with Enron stock No no no you must have it all wrong it cant be that thats just too bad too fraudulent surely AA Co wouldnt let them get away with that Go back to the drawing board its got to be something else But find it Hey just in case you might be right try and find some insiders or redeployed former employees to validate your theory Previous businessTEXThtmlpagewanted businessTEXThtmlpagewanted Matt Haverty Director Strategic Investments Aquila Energy
