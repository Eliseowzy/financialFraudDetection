four days negotiating on the side Forwarded by Terence H ThornENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Terence H Thorn PM To Rob NRON Joe NRON Chris NRON Edith TerryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Lay WTO Speech Rob has provided everyone a new set of slides for Kens speech They want Ken to speak for minutes Once we agree on these we have to put together talking points for Ken to use I would like to be at that point this Wednesday so we have the rest of the week to get feed back fro Ken and finalize the speech next Monday or Tuesday Let me try out some themes We need to put energy developments in the context of globalization The worlds economy is integrating as never before as transborder trade increases capital becomes more mobile technology speeds this process To compete in this new arena countries must have access to the most talented labor the most advanced technology and the lowest cost highest quality suppliers of goods and services No where is this more critical that in the areas of energy production transportation distribution and use Historically energy trade has focused on technology to explore produce and export energy In the s the focus shifted to using that energy internally to fuel the tremendous economic growth experienced by developing economies The focus became infrastructure development and interregional trade as governments removed the legal and regulatory barriers to private energy and infrastructure development With energy demand increasing at high rates the potential for price increases the need to develop and use new energy technologies and the related environmental problems associated with economic development the next focus must be on opening these same economies to the world class suppliers and partners which have the intellectual property talent networks and technology to provide the answers to the more efficient production transportation and use of energy By opening their economies to an expanded trade in energy services these countries gain instant access to the skills and capabilities that have taken decades to develop elsewhere But its not just governments that benefit In the US and Europe today we have seen an explosion of customer choice in their providers of products services prices and terms The service industries have led the way in providing more value at better prices This will help economies leverage their own financial technological and intellectual capabilities Having put the need to have energy services on the WTO agenda I would now turn the problem of defining the energy services sector I dont like the third chart Energy Services Overview its confusing I dont know if you are listing the companies involved in services in the coalition or what I far prefer the type of chart Rachel Thompson uses in her environmental services presentation on page three Some examples of environmental goods and services We can briefly talk about the historic issues here but also forward our recommendations on how energy services should be considered in the WTO GATS discussions The inclusion in the next GATS round is not an end in itself but will start a process that will Clarify the definition of energy services Identify the barriers to trade in energy services Set the goals for the desired level of market openess Establish commitments on transparency due process and regulatory implementation From here we do a summary of global trends the important role energy services will play in a globalized economy how expanded trade in energy services can be a direct channel for technology transfer This is the winwin section In turning to the slides Rob provided I have already mentioned my concerns about the second slide The list of members of the coalition can stay it represents the depth and variety of businesses in this area The energy and infrastructure slides fit the initial story The energy services megatrend slide has a long way to go Maybe we can show the trend production and export private infrastructure development and the next step mass customization The privatization slide doesnt go here but Im not sure what the point is or how we want to tie privatization to energy services The globalization slides need to go earlier if we are to use the story I outlined but the globalization of energy trade slide is about the trade in commodities It doesnt fit we are after data on the goods and services that make this trade happen not the commodity per se The customization is fine we need to have solid talking points about why customization of energy services helps economies This will be a tough section I dont think we have anything in the can exactly on this point Do we need new markets for competitive energy Energy outsourcing and information age are fine I like the nexus between energy and environment The talking points here should focus on this part of the energy services business EES should have lots of talking points in this area The benefits slide can be expanded I dont see the need for the fragmentation slide Point On the conclusions dont be so threatening Rather than say must adapt we should be talking about the benefits of embracing the new energy market Add a point about rising demand environment problems the need to produce and use energy more efficiently

TerryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Ken Thompson Subject Re EWG meeting The Energy Business network survived the EWG meeting in Wellington Ill give you a quick recap and my impressions and we can decide if I should send a note out to everyone next week or wait until we meet on the th for my report The official report should be on the internet Monday A meeting of the EBN has been scheduled in Melbourne on March to coincide with the Davos Meeting They are also talking about an EWG meeting in March also I will be late for the meeting on the th I have a black tie dinner on Tuesday night and will take the first plane to Houston from New York Wednesday AM Sorry but I cant get out of the dinner its been planned for a long time and I have guests countries were present If you look back on the agenda for the th meeting of the EWG business network on November in Wellington four agenda items were of particular interest to the Energy Business Network the report on the nd meeting of the EBN meeting we were forewarned that the activities of the EBN would be under attack by the Japanese Chinese and Mexicans the discussion and report on the EWG implementation Committees Visit Team to Thailand November the DOE recommendation on a Proposed Plan of Work on Energy Services again very controversial the proposed Energy Ministerial in the US in the Spring Mexico China and Japan were not happy with the proactive push of the EBN I assume it was Mexico that made sure we were excluded from the discussions on the Thai visit and energy services two EBN initiatives Barry and I would only be allowed in the room for the EBN report something I protested prior to the meeting With the help of Tim Mackey we somewhat circumvented the restriction by his going around the room one by one after Barrys report asking for reaction to what was said This forced a discussion with us in the room Both Barry and I responded to the issues raised The dissenters maintained that the EBN was working too fast and that we were taking the initiative away from the EWG and becoming too independent Japan supports the concept of the EBN but made it clear that it was the EWG that sets initiatives The EBN summary of decisions was a particular affront We had strong support from Australia Canada Korea Malaysia New Zealand the Philippines they are concerned that the EBN not duplicate EWG initiatives Singapore Thailand and the US China surprised us by complaining that the EWG and EBN meetings were now separate not back to back Barry explained this was more an accident that anything else It took some effort but I think we made our case I emphasized strongly that the EBN consisted of some of the best and brightest in the energy industry and that we would not be shy about offering our ideas We operate with a great sense of urgency seeing that APEC will eventually trillion of investment to meet their energy needs Each economy could accept of reject these ideas but I doubted they wanted to be a rubber stamp for the EWG As for energy services as I understood it the DOE program was designed to get the EWG up to speed on what energy services are an educational effort that compliments what is going on at the WTO Services represented stage three in energy development that would increase the efficiency of the infrastructure and offer new products and services to users of energy The key discussion would occur on Friday in our absence There were two official reports on the Thai meeting one by the secretariat which was more of a recap of the process and agenda with no evaluation of the success and one by the Thais the last paragraph of which was very favorable Ironically the controversy concerned the process by which we participants were chosen No one has been able to explain to me why the EWG would care about this issue and I honestly believe that the USG was a major factor in stirring this up and when you cut through the bull its about exerting control over the EWG Again everyone was in support of the consultative process and the value it brings in opening dialogues on difficult issues I noted that the Thais should get particular credit for being so open and candid in the discussions In our absence there was a long discussion on the Energy principles endorsed by the EBN which were turned back into an Energy Charter They agreed that an Energy Charter statement would be drafted by the secretariat and circulated to member economies The implementation committee discussion on Friday was supportive but as I noted but focused on the process not as I emphasized it should be on the results which were a success They was strong support led by DOEUSG to eliminate the steering and implementation committees I did not see the final language and was presented with two conflicting versions one that letters requesting a visit would go to the secretariat who would forward them to the EWG and EBN for suggestions on who should participate the Secretariat deciding and one where the Secretariat sends the request to the EWG and they consult with their EBN representatives and decide I made it clear that the latter process was unacceptable and the EBN would strongly oppose it This process would take months and the EWG was in no position to decide who could best provide the people to address an economies specific request I told this to the USG delegation and they assured me the former would be the model Well see Energy services was also a long discussion and the Japanese focused on severing this initiative from anything to do with the WTO In my private discussions with the Japanese they expressed the concern that this could be considered an endorsement of the liberalization of energy services and used against them in the WTO negotiations Again I didnt see the final outcome but I understand that at the next EWG meeting will present a trimmed own version of the work plan minus any reference to the WTO It was agreed that there should be a seminar on the topic but the EWG would only consider a seminar at the next meeting This is way to slow and Barry and David think we need to get a white paper before the EWG in the next few months and push for a seminar at the next EWG meeting This is awkward for me since the US EBN has no position but the entire EBN supports this effort as does the USG and we need to work with everyone to make the effort a success With great skepticism that the US can organize a Ministerial in five months Edmonton took ten months the EWG agreed to a Ministerial May At the EWG meeting on Thursday I pushed the idea that the day before the official meeting should be dedicated to a series of direct interactions with the business community much like the Latin meeting in New Orleans The USG said they will include this idea in their proposal at the January steering meeting The Ministerial will be on the west coast I am glad that I was there even though many of the discussions were painful We beat down and reconfirmed strong support for the EBN although it may be watered down energy services is still on the table and can still be a valuable educating process while meeting the concerns of some of the US EBN members the consultative process is alive and well well see if its been wounded and we may have a great opportunity in May for direct interaction with the energy ministers Wish you had been there It rained for four days

fuel the tremendous economic growth experienced by developing economies The focus became infrastructure development and interregional trade as governments removed the legal and regulatory barriers to private energy and infrastructure development With energy demand increasing at high rates the potential for price increases the need to develop and use new energy technologies and the related environmental problems associated with economic development the next focus must be on opening these same economies to the world class suppliers and partners which have the intellectual property talent networks and technology to provide the answers to the more efficient production transportation and use of energy By opening their economies to an expanded trade in energy services these countries gain instant access to the skills and capabilities that have taken decades to develop elsewhere But its not just governments that benefit In the US and Europe today we have seen an explosion of customer choice in their providers of products services prices and terms The service industries have led the way in providing more value at better prices This will help economies leverage their own financial technological and intellectual capabilities Having put the need to have energy services on the WTO agenda I would now turn the problem of defining the energy services sector I dont like the third chart Energy Services Overview its confusing I dont know if you are listing the companies involved in services in the coalition or what I far prefer the type of chart Rachel Thompson uses in her environmental services presentation on page three Some examples of environmental goods and services We can briefly talk about the historic issues here but also forward our recommendations on how energy services should be considered in the WTO GATS discussions The inclusion in the next GATS round is not an end in itself but will start a process that will Clarify the definition of energy services Identify the barriers to trade in energy services Set the goals for the desired level of market openess Establish commitments on transparency due process and regulatory implementation From here we do a summary of global trends the important role energy services will play in a globalized economy how expanded trade in energy services can be a direct channel for technology transfer This is the winwin section In turning to the slides Rob provided I have already mentioned my concerns about the second slide The list of members of the coalition can stay it represents the depth and variety of businesses in this area The energy and infrastructure slides fit the initial story The energy services megatrend slide has a long way to go Maybe we can show the trend production and export private infrastructure development and the next step mass customization The privatization slide doesnt go here but Im not sure what the point is or how we want to tie privatization to energy services The globalization slides need to go earlier if we are to use the story I outlined but the globalization of energy trade slide is about the trade in commodities It doesnt fit we are after data on the goods and services that make this trade happen not the commodity per se The customization is fine we need to have solid talking points about why customization of energy services helps economies This will be a tough section I dont think we have anything in the can exactly on this point Do we need new markets for competitive energy Energy outsourcing and information age are fine I like the nexus between energy and environment The talking points here should focus on this part of the energy services business EES should have lots of talking points in this area The benefits slide can be expanded I dont see the need for the fragmentation slide Point On the conclusions dont be so threatening Rather than say must adapt we should be talking about the benefits of embracing the new energy market Add a point about rising demand environment problems the need to produce and use energy more efficiently

on March to coincide with the Davos Meeting They are also talking about an EWG meeting in March also I will be late for the meeting on the th I have a black tie dinner on Tuesday night and will take the first plane to Houston from New York Wednesday AM Sorry but I cant get out of the dinner its been planned for a long time and I have guests countries were present If you look back on the agenda for the th meeting of the EWG business network on November in Wellington four agenda items were of particular interest to the Energy Business Network the report on the nd meeting of the EBN meeting we were forewarned that the activities of the EBN would be under attack by the Japanese Chinese and Mexicans the discussion and report on the EWG implementation Committees Visit Team to Thailand November the DOE recommendation on a Proposed Plan of Work on Energy Services again very controversial the proposed Energy Ministerial in the US in the Spring Mexico China and Japan were not happy with the proactive push of the EBN I assume it was Mexico that made sure we were excluded from the discussions on the Thai visit and energy services two EBN initiatives Barry and I would only be allowed in the room for the EBN report something I protested prior to the meeting With the help of Tim Mackey we somewhat circumvented the restriction by his going around the room one by one after Barrys report asking for reaction to what was said This forced a discussion with us in the room Both Barry and I responded to the issues raised The dissenters maintained that the EBN was working too fast and that we were taking the initiative away from the EWG and becoming too independent Japan supports the concept of the EBN but made it clear that it was the EWG that sets initiatives The EBN summary of decisions was a particular affront We had strong support from Australia Canada Korea Malaysia New Zealand the Philippines they are concerned that the EBN not duplicate EWG initiatives Singapore Thailand and the US China surprised us by complaining that the EWG and EBN meetings were now separate not back to back Barry explained this was more an accident that anything else It took some effort but I think we made our case I emphasized strongly that the EBN consisted of some of the best and brightest in the energy industry and that we would not be shy about offering our ideas We operate with a great sense of urgency seeing that APEC will eventually trillion of investment to meet their energy needs Each economy could accept of reject these ideas but I doubted they wanted to be a rubber stamp for the EWG As for energy services as I understood it the DOE program was designed to get the EWG up to speed on what energy services are an educational effort that compliments what is going on at the WTO Services represented stage three in energy development that would increase the efficiency of the infrastructure and offer new products and services to users of energy The key discussion would occur on Friday in our absence There were two official reports on the Thai meeting one by the secretariat which was more of a recap of the process and agenda with no evaluation of the success and one by the Thais the last paragraph of which was very favorable Ironically the controversy concerned the process by which we participants were chosen No one has been able to explain to me why the EWG would care about this issue and I honestly believe that the USG was a major factor in stirring this up and when you cut through the bull its about exerting control over the EWG Again everyone was in support of the consultative process and the value it brings in opening dialogues on difficult issues I noted that the Thais should get particular credit for being so open and candid in the discussions In our absence there was a long discussion on the Energy principles endorsed by the EBN which were turned back into an Energy Charter They agreed that an Energy Charter statement would be drafted by the secretariat and circulated to member economies The implementation committee discussion on Friday was supportive but as I noted but focused on the process not as I emphasized it should be on the results which were a success They was strong support led by DOEUSG to eliminate the steering and implementation committees I did not see the final language and was presented with two conflicting versions one that letters requesting a visit would go to the secretariat who would forward them to the EWG and EBN for suggestions on who should participate the Secretariat deciding and one where the Secretariat sends the request to the EWG and they consult with their EBN representatives and decide I made it clear that the latter process was unacceptable and the EBN would strongly oppose it This process would take months and the EWG was in no position to decide who could best provide the people to address an economies specific request I told this to the USG delegation and they assured me the former would be the model Well see Energy services was also a long discussion and the Japanese focused on severing this initiative from anything to do with the WTO In my private discussions with the Japanese they expressed the concern that this could be considered an endorsement of the liberalization of energy services and used against them in the WTO negotiations Again I didnt see the final outcome but I understand that at the next EWG meeting will present a trimmed own version of the work plan minus any reference to the WTO It was agreed that there should be a seminar on the topic but the EWG would only consider a seminar at the next meeting This is way to slow and Barry and David think we need to get a white paper before the EWG in the next few months and push for a seminar at the next EWG meeting This is awkward for me since the US EBN has no position but the entire EBN supports this effort as does the USG and we need to work with everyone to make the effort a success With great skepticism that the US can organize a Ministerial in five months Edmonton took ten months the EWG agreed to a Ministerial May At the EWG meeting on Thursday I pushed the idea that the day before the official meeting should be dedicated to a series of direct interactions with the business community much like the Latin meeting in New Orleans The USG said they will include this idea in their proposal at the January steering meeting The Ministerial will be on the west coast I am glad that I was there even though many of the discussions were painful We beat down and reconfirmed strong support for the EBN although it may be watered down energy services is still on the table and can still be a valuable educating process while meeting the concerns of some of the US EBN members the consultative process is alive and well well see if its been wounded and we may have a great opportunity in May for direct interaction with the energy ministers Wish you had been there It rained for four days

this Wednesday so we have the rest of the week to get feed back fro Ken and finalize the speech next Monday or Tuesday Let me try out some themes We need to put energy developments in the context of globalization The worlds economy is integrating as never before as transborder trade increases capital becomes more mobile technology speeds this process To compete in this new arena countries must have access to the most talented labor the most advanced technology and the lowest cost highest quality suppliers of goods and services No where is this more critical that in the areas of energy

idea that the day before the official meeting should be dedicated to a series of direct interactions with the business community much like the Latin meeting in New Orleans The USG said they will include this idea in their proposal at the January steering meeting The Ministerial will be on the west coast I am glad that I was there even though many of the discussions were painful We beat down and reconfirmed strong support for the EBN although it may be watered down energy services is still on the table and can still be a valuable educating process while meeting the concerns of some of the US EBN members the consultative process is alive and well well see if its been wounded and we may have a great opportunity in May for direct interaction with the energy ministers Wish you had been there It rained for four days

four days negotiating on the side Forwarded by Terence H ThornENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Terence H Thorn PM To Rob NRON Joe NRON Chris NRON Edith TerryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Lay WTO Speech Rob has provided everyone a new set of slides for Kens speech They want Ken to speak for minutes Once we agree on these we have to put together talking points for Ken to use I would like to be at that point this Wednesday so we have the rest of the week to get feed back fro Ken and finalize the speech next Monday or Tuesday Let me try out some themes We need to put energy developments in the context of globalization The worlds economy is integrating as never before as transborder trade increases capital becomes more mobile technology speeds this process To compete in this new arena countries must have access to the most talented labor the most advanced technology and the lowest cost highest quality suppliers of goods and services No where is this more critical that in the areas of energy production transportation distribution and use Historically energy trade has focused on technology to explore produce and export energy In the s the focus shifted to using that energy internally to fuel the tremendous economic growth experienced by developing economies The focus became infrastructure development and interregional trade as governments removed the legal and regulatory barriers to private energy and infrastructure development With energy demand increasing at high rates the potential for price increases the need to develop and use new energy technologies and the related environmental problems associated with economic development the next focus must be on opening these same economies to the world class suppliers and partners which have the intellectual property talent networks and technology to provide the answers to the more efficient production transportation and use of energy By opening their economies to an expanded trade in energy services these countries gain instant access to the skills and capabilities that have taken decades to develop elsewhere But its not just governments that benefit In the US and Europe today we have seen an explosion of customer choice in their providers of products services prices and terms The service industries have led the way in providing more value at better prices This will help economies leverage their own financial technological and intellectual capabilities Having put the need to have energy services on the WTO agenda I would now turn the problem of defining the energy services sector I dont like the third chart Energy Services Overview its confusing I dont know if you are listing the companies involved in services in the coalition or what I far prefer the type of chart Rachel Thompson uses in her environmental services presentation on page three Some examples of environmental goods and services We can briefly talk about the historic issues here but also forward our recommendations on how energy services should be considered in the WTO GATS discussions The inclusion in the next GATS round is not an end in itself but will start a process that will Clarify the definition of energy services Identify the barriers to trade in energy services Set the goals for the desired level of market openess Establish commitments on transparency due process and regulatory implementation From here we do a summary of global trends the important role energy services will play in a globalized economy how expanded trade in energy services can be a direct channel for technology transfer This is the winwin section In turning to the slides Rob provided I have already mentioned my concerns about the second slide The list of members of the coalition can stay it represents the depth and variety of businesses in this area The energy and infrastructure slides fit the initial story The energy services megatrend slide has a long way to go Maybe we can show the trend production and export private infrastructure development and the next step mass customization The privatization slide doesnt go here but Im not sure what the point is or how we want to tie privatization to energy services The globalization slides need to go earlier if we are to use the story I outlined but the globalization of energy trade slide is about the trade in commodities It doesnt fit we are after data on the goods and services that make this trade happen not the commodity per se The customization is fine we need to have solid talking points about why customization of energy services helps economies This will be a tough section I dont think we have anything in the can exactly on this point Do we need new markets for competitive energy Energy outsourcing and information age are fine I like the nexus between energy and environment The talking points here should focus on this part of the energy services business EES should have lots of talking points in this area The benefits slide can be expanded I dont see the need for the fragmentation slide Point On the conclusions dont be so threatening Rather than say must adapt we should be talking about the benefits of embracing the new energy market Add a point about rising demand environment problems the need to produce and use energy more efficiently

Mike for two reasons Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January submission and subsequent presentations As Mike noted we are in sudden death overtime and the th could be the end of the tournament Revisit the street talk about Enron redeploying capital Mike walked through the EGM organization talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price Dale talked about their low multiple between and noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals buy and sell assets but really wasnt a growth company They now have a stable cash flow but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital They agree on a division of labor Oxy can do EP processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too They realize that only Enron has the marketing structuring and regulatory expertise Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of merchant banker Thats OK in the end Dale even said they would take over our part of any project but we cant project that role initially We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects They expect our competitors to say theyll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we arent really locked in an onbalance sheet approach Maybe we can do this maybe we cant They see this as a year long process with PDAs stretching well into next year and when the real money would be spent The short term crisis is January and we need a submission with lots of pages we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb it didnt have enough pages reams of paper to impress the technocrats We will also need to prepare a smaller page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US We also all agreed that the Jan questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project I have had the greatest success around the world when we dont try to force immediately on a country a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to local conditions and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later In this respect our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi Casey will be Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions Who will be our lead person with the same authority They dont want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed its mind a little arrogant When can we identify bodies and assignments and location They want full time dedicated people Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick This is a very complicated political and technical effort The leader has to be good at both Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project I guess you discussed this with him They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the th deadline I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January we had our first conference call yesterday but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process we arent about to sacrifice a deliberative strategicconsensus thought process because they are in a hurry We spent a lot of time talking about the process We agree that the Saudis will eliminate one or two participants that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent million over the next years They see core project costing million OxyEnron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that We arent talking billions spoken like a true major They are sure Exxon Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face with possibly Marathon as the other Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner Exxon who would throw away money just to have a presence We were assured that Oxys only goal was to make money and if he projects didnt they would walk away The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments pipelines and plants and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects They are very proud of Oxys role in this claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has great access in the Kingdom and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudis We all left great friends in good Christmas spirit From our perspective Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect Can we do it with minimal capital investment Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring regulatory included They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals The country can be a tremendous source of capital It looks like can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead

period of activity being in January We need to set up the team for the January effort Ill have this done by Jan There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities Although it may be too soon to answer we dont know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome what is the end game what do we want out of Saudi Arabia We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture Red Sea I agree this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business Mike Im sure you can add more Rick its up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team Merry Christmas
