resolved ODNSS recommendationssuggestions on a variety of matters and their support activity for NEPCO over the last couple of years has been well received and valued by our internal clients Thanks Mike Original Message From Cash Michelle mailtoMichelle NRONcom Sent Thursday October PM To ENRON Cc Gillis John Smith Gary Subject RE lake worth project David For clarification I was present during Mark Stubleys brief training session over the phone I memorialized the key points in a summary email Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it On the issue of Ogletree training I had mentioned that it might be more cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training Mike had indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree Of course since Mark has done it for us in the past I am ok with him doing it as well I just was looking at the outside expenditures as we all have been doing lately particularly outside counsel bills and thought that there may be some cost savings In some circumstances outside counsel who have to travel cut their rates a bit for travel time dont know if Stubley does that so the cost differential could be minimal but I thought Id raise it since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that arena Ill give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel which I do not believe to be significant Because Mark has contacted them they already have run a conflict check and are ready to go All it would take to get them engaged would be a phone call There should not be any cost incurred at this point because they only are on standby so I think it is good to line them up Ill let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their recommendation I also have received recommendations for topnotch local labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route Let me know if you have any questions Michelle Original Message From ENRON Sent Thu PM To Cc Gillis John Cash Michelle Subject RE lake worth project Mike I know of no hold up here I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not withheld or said different to retaining this counsel I would suggest that you call Michelle anytime you have a concern with regard to the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside counsel And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with in Florida he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins by copy to Michelle Ill ask for her input here I saw the correspondence from Mr Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the Mayor of Lake Worth I interpret this as a public official saying what is expected neither favoring the picketers or us just saying he will uphold the law We appreciate that David H Lund Jr
