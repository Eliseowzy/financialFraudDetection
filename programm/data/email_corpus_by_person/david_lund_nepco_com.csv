received a call am from Greg Renz Resident Engineer that Joe Osler Construction Manager was in a meeting at the jobsite with union organizers I immediately notified Bob Black and Mike Indivero by phone I arrived on site about and went to Tommy CutrersElectrical Supt office and met with Joe Tommy Paul Wedell Union Organizer for Local of U A of Plumbers and Pipefitters of the United States and Canadabased in West Palm Beach and Otis didnt get his last name who we believe to be the Business Agent Joe introduced me as the Site HR Manager and Otis offered us pipefitters and welders to do the mechanical work on this project I told them that we were not in a position to take applications for pipefitters and welders because it was early in the project and we have only opening for carpenter helpers posted with the work force development commission I told them at some time we would be hiring pipefitters and welders and they could apply for those positions at that time I told them that we do not discriminate against anyone because of age sex race religion or union affiliation Otis the business agent asked if we were bringing all our people from outside the area I told them that Nepco has an Office in Lakeland FL where we are finishing up a power project and we would be offering employment to former employees who wanted to work in this part of the state I told them that any of our unfilled needs would be filled by qualified craft personnel and that we would be happy to consider their applications I exchanged business cards with Paul Wadell and told him to call me later in the month and let him know where our offsite employment was located They left the jobsite Joe said that the conversations that occured prior to my arrival were not about our hiring policies Joe deferred the hiring issues to me which is what Mark Stubleys recommendation were during our last conference call Joe did an excellent job in keeping the hiring issues to a single point of contact After they left Joe and I discussed several issues which we are moving on as quickly as possible They are as follows Get ready for an OSHA or other Official visit in case the Union Organizer wants to be disruptive Already prepped the site at am Tuesday for visitors Made sure safety supervisor was on site and available to escort any visitors Contacted security company about implementing hour patrols and single access gate Contacted fencing company to review fencing plan Instructed safety supervisor to place red barricade tape around jobsite perimeter with gates and signs to direct all employees and visitors to authorized access areas May want to consider ID badging system for Employees Home Office Visitors Vendors Escorted and Unescorted badges Keep Visitors Staff employee log for times when anyone enters or leaves the jobsite Have project pager assigned to a different staff person each week to be the point of contact in case anything happens on site after hours that needs to be addressed I will get in touch with Carroll Scott with Fluor Daniel and Leonard Wallace with Foster Wheeler to see if they have any background on Pipefitters Local and how serious an organizing campaign they might be willing to mount against Nepco Establish a project contingency plan on what to do if we have pickets at the gate Find out who we have as local counsel and notify them of this contact and what they might know about previous ULPs and organizing efforts by Local Contact Mark Stubley with Ogletree Deakins and advise him of this visit Consider accelerating the Labor Relations Training date that was planned for Nov with Bob King of Ogletree Deakins Have Tommy Cutrer Joe Osler and Greg Renz write statements about what they said during their visit Post the property we control with signs that prohibit use of photographic video or audio recording equipment on the property unless authorized by Mr Osler Establish a Jobsite file maintained by the HR Site Manager of all union related activities and contacts to be used in our defense of any ULP charges If I think of anything else Ill let you know
