are the issues with this nitrogen rejection technology Adaptation of PSA technology controls pore diameter pd at A and excludes methane which has a pd of A and captures the nitrogen with a pd of A Nice feature there is only a psi pressure drop between the feed gas and the product gas for this technology Issues At low inlet pressures or low nitrogen concentrations the methane recovery can be as low as unless a recycle system is utilized Then the recovery rate improves to greater than As the inlet pressure increases the recovery improves to but the recycle is approx PSA technology has operated at a psig maximum pressure economically since it uses many ANSI flanges and valves Higher pressures are achievable but the gas recoveries costs are required to be offset the higher cost of ANSI valves and flanges The tail gas stream needs to have an economic home This stream operates in the psia to psia range and has a Btuscf If the feed gas has a high concentration of Cs and C a pre treatment BPSA is required to extract the heavies for the nitrogen removal PSA Gas impurities like CO or HS each require evaluation based on feed gas analysis Engelhard claims for to psia operating range it can deliver nitrogen in the residue gas and will achieve a methane recovery for nitrogen stream and the recovery falls to methane for a feed stream of nitrogen This implies a recycle system is built into the design Alternative technologies Cryogenic separation Absorption and membrane units good for crude separation Dennis Zitterkopf and I will be happy to review any stranded wells or other technologies Regards Gene From Arnold L Eisenstein AM To Dennis C ZitterkopfENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Eugene OGormanENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Eric FaucheauxET nron Subject RE Nitrogen facility Dennis Gene for your comments Eric We have looked in the past at various schemes for Bushton Dennis knows the entire system and the existing facilities at Bushton Forwarded by Arnold L

Subject RE Nitrogen facility I have recently requested quotations from Engelhard Corporation for their new technology for nitrogen removal wwwengelhardcom Their process is new technology and have only a few units in production that is available for field inspection One unit is located in SW Colorado and reduces dehydrated gas from to N The process is called the Molecular Gate System and uses a patented mole sieve absorbent process The process removes both nitrogen and CO with a pressure drop across the unit of approximately psi Some methane is lost in the regeneration process and an enriched recycle stream high in C will need to be recycled requiring a small compressor unit Estimated costs excluding a recycle compressor are about MM for a MMcfd unit and MM for a MMcfd unit Installation is not included in estimated costs but may vary between K to K for locations I am investigating this process further because I feel that the benefits of nitrogen removal in the Bushton Universe might prove to be economical with satelite installations versus a common point cryogenic plant considering that NNG is currently transporting MMcf of N per day The removal of N would equate to lower OM expenses on compression and higher heating values on the NNG system Both would help Enron realize higher revenue potential Rich Jolly AM To Kevin nronxgate cc Earl ChanleyET NRON Eric FaucheauxET nron Subject RE Nitrogen facility Thanks and let me know how I can help Rich From Kevin nronxgate on PM CST To Earl ChanleyET NRON Rich JollyET NRON cc Eric FaucheauxET nron Subject RE Nitrogen facility Thanks Earl for the info Eric Faucheaux is looking at some technology using cell membranes that may be much cheaper I gave him some gas sample info of volume near the Panhandle lateral that we may be able to do a test on Lets continue to keep each other posted kh Original Message From Chanley Earl Sent Friday March AM To Hyatt Kevin Jolly Rich Subject Nitrogen facility Kevin Rich You had asked about nitrogen removal facilities for a customer and an order of magnitude dollar amount which can vary due to the of nitrogen in the gas stream is for a mmcfd facility this cost is without compression There are several process available and to go any further down the road we would need to contact the customer and get a gas quality and more information To remove nitrogen base on assumptions it would require the removal of CO Glycol dehy for large water content dry bed dehy for water fines and cyro for nitrogen removal recompression to get it back to pipeline pressure I dont think the producer would want to spend that amount of money for small volumes If you would like for us to research any further please let us know Thanks Earl Chanley Embedded StdOleLink Embedded
