market between the crisis in confidence caused by the Enron debacle and the increasingly positive nature of the economic d ata First lets chat about the Enron fallout The market seems to be suffering from a nasty case of Enronitis as some o f the talking heads have called the recent negative sentiment in the market Clearly something changed with the bankruptcy of Enron It is the largest US bankruptcy ever There are not one but two official governmental inves tigations of the company and further investigations are likely The bankers accountants and the lawyers are also going to get a hard look What has t he market particularly bothered is the glaring oversight by Arthur Anderson AA one of the big five accounting firms Delta Airlines has been using AA for over years and they are looking for a new auditor Also the cred it rating agencies dropped the ball too One of them actually upgraded Enro ns debt a few weeks before its demise What is the investing public to thi nk Who can you trust Generally investors understand that the Streets ad vice needs to be viewed with a critical eye but the accountants were suppo sed to be looking out for investors It certainly makes you say hmmmmm The market hates uncertainty and the level of uncertainty has increased gre atly and it is not likely to dissipate for some time Imagine the discussio ns at the other accounting firms Companies are not going to be able to sli p anything by their accountants from now on Standards are going to be toug hened up and that may cause some pain for companies that have pushed the en velope in the past In addition the market is going to search and destroy every company that has Enronlike qualities Offbalance sheet partnerships or structures complicated financial statements and foreign domiciled tax structures It started almost right away with the decimation of Enrons com petitors Williams WMB El Paso EP Mirant MIR and Calpine CPN who have had to sell assets and issue stock in order to repair their balance s heets Some of those companies are trading as if we will never need power o r natural gas again EP is my favourite among these companies as you know Next the market had its day or so with the asbestosinfected companies a nd then more recently proceeded to anyone with offbalance sheet assets or a history of accounting indiscretions We had better get used to this sort of rollercoaster existence With over hedge funds a hyperactive me dia and market information available the witch hunts will continue S till it is important to note a few things First not all companies with offbalance sheet items are guilty of transgr essions and not every company that acquires others for a living a la Tyco violates standard accounting principles In fact nobody has proven yet that Tyco has done anything improper The risk of impropriety makes people sell not the fact Second regardless of whether your company is guilty of doing anything nast y if it plays in the same sandbox as a company that attracts the ire of i nvestors it is going down Period Full stop No matter if it is guilty of anything or not These are market events not business events Consider the pain and suffering experienced by El Paso EP thanks to Enron or Viacom VIAb thanks to Haliburton HAL and its asbestos exposure Viacom bought CBS which owned Westinghouse once upon a time but that did not stop the st ock from getting pasted even though it is insured and reserved up the wazoo up the wazoo is a technical term signifying a significant amount Third emotions and sentiment can push stock prices around a great deal in the short term but over the long term stock prices are determined by a co mpanys ability to generate cash The best opportunities are likely to come from buying companies with low debt levels that are relatively free of con troversy but have been beaten up because they resemble another company wit h a real problem Biovail BVF Viacom VIAb El Paso EP etc However each of these names also comes with an increased risk profile as a result of the markets heightened sensitivity to issues accounting asbestos debt levels litigation etc On the economic front the data seems to be point to an economic recovery t hat is already underway Consumer confidence rose from to in January and was up for the se cond straight month The index is now above the preSeptember level Als o the expectations component of the index was the highest in over a year s uggesting that consumer spending should continue to hold up well Durable Goods orders rose in December and importantly the extransportation orders rose for a third month in a row the longest streak of gains in y ears New home sales rose stronger than expected and taken together with last wee ks existing home sales total home sales were above million annualize d and stable Today the unemployment rate fell to and the week moving average of jobless claims fell to its lowest level since August and the ISM NAPM in dex came in at vs expected and new orders remained above ind icating order volume is expanding Finally on the international front the German Business Confidence index r ose and is now close to its preSeptember level Unfortunately Japan continues to struggle The Japanese unemployment rate rose to a record high and real wageearning household spending fell compared to last year Both figures were worse than expected and the dro p in household spending does not bode well the prospects of an economic rec overy Also the yen continues to slide as confidence in the government and the economy wanes The Japanese fiscal year ends on March st and there i s widespread concern that the countrys banks will have to mark down the va lue of more loans and investments potentially pushing some of them into ba nkruptcy Of course a number of bankruptcies would be a good thing much li ke the SL crisis was for the US in the early s A cathartic cleansing followed by an audible flush could lead to a great buying opportunity Stay tuned Financials The US banks are trading very poorly no wonder Credit quali ty which everybody knew was bad has turned out to be at least as nasty as expected or worse PNC Financial PNC had to restate its earnings when th e SEC forced the company to consolidate subsidiaries KMart KM filed f or chapter Global Crossings GX shuts its doors and today the nd bi ggest European cable company defaulted on billion in debt and preferre d stock When you add these events on to the Enron scenario it makes inves tors of all kinds hold a bit more cash a few more government bonds and a l ittle less equity This is the kind of pain that is quite typical for the t rough of the credit cycle As you know JP Morgan JPM has been a recommen ded stock for many quarters however it looks like it will be removed from the US Focus List as it has broken our technical screen The stock remains buy or strong buy rated around the Street and a great deal of bad news woul d seem to be already priced into the stock However the risk of further ne gative credit events seems quite high and as a result we suggest that new money go into Citigroup C which is trading at just under x EPS v s its historical range of about x to x Out anlaysts comments on Sun Life SLC suggest this is a name we should continue to accumulate Sun Microsystems SUNW is under pressure following negative comments

MSFT was added to Goldman Sachs portfolio and Oracle ORCL was removed Calpine CPN was downgraded to Deutche Bank to BUY from Strong Buy due to a lack of nearterm catalysts in the stock current risks include continue d weakness in power prices and spark spreads the California DWR contract r enegotiations a highly leveraged balance sheet and a tight cash flow situ ation Price target is We should get used to reading recommendations l ike this one The list of risks is large and imposing and yet many of you w ill notice that the target is suggesting a return is possible over the next months We would encourage investors to focus on the risks and the likelihood of them happening rather than a highly subjective target In Canada focus on Focus List names Sun Life SLC and Shaw Communications SJRb Suitability is everything never more so than in the current mark et environment Interest Rate Update The big but not so surprising news yesterday was the decision by the FOMC to keep the Fed funds rate steady at while the discount rate remaine d at also as expected the Fed maintained their easing bias This was the first no change following an FOMC meeting since Dec after of cuts in steps through The committee noted that there are signs that weakness in demand is abating and economic activity is beginning to firm have become more prevalent This is different from the last comm ent on Dec when they stated weakness in demand shows signs of abating but those signs are preliminary and tentative The easing bias was justif ied due to the uncertainty of the strength in business capital and consumer spending RBC CM Economics believe that this statement will be a sign of things to come with rates in a holding pattern and an easing bias remaini ng until the recovery is firmly and sustainably in place They are callin g for the first hike to occur no earlier than September Fed funds future s are pricing in earlier expectations the July contract is indicating a chance of a bps hike Stocks are the bigger news with Nasdaq stock futures up pts after an upgrade to Intel by Merrill Lynch gains in Oracle after the company reaffi rmed its profit target and Applied Materials stating that a bottom has com e and gone for the industry Have a good weekend and be good Rod
