Power positions included and wi th a separate business unit sublimit for EES Policy amendments were as follows u Clarify the crosscommodity trading policy to specify that trading limits are to be applied against Enrons consolidated commodity positions on an individual commodity group basis Enrons consolidated Daily Position R eport should provide required market risk disclosures by primary commodity group for example Enrons exposure to the North American Natural Gas market shall be aggregated across the company Delegate crosscommodity trading approval among established commodity groups to the respective Business Units Offices of the Chairman with appropriate reporting to the Enron Corp Chief Risk Officer u Specify the operational control requirement that all trades executed over the telephone must be recorded electronically Crosscommodity trading authority was not automatically preapproved for anyone in the company Authority to trade a commodity for which you are not the authorized trader must be obtained from the Business Unit Office of the Chairman for the commodity group that is authorized to trade that commodity with appropriate reporting as noted below North American CrossCommodity Limits VaR Limit None terminated the MM VaR limit North American Natural Gas Net Open Position Bcf Maturity Gap Risk Limit Bcf VaR Limit MM EES MM North American Electricity Net Open Position Twh Maturity Gap Risk Limit Twh VaR Limit MM EES MM EESs MM VaR was allocated between Gas and Power for purposes of calculating consolidated NA Gas and Power limits From a business unit perspective the MM VaR limit will continue to be monitored for EES in total Below are relevant excerpts from the revised policy addressing the crosscommodity trading guidelines I will distribute the entire updated policy as soon as we incorporate the BODs comments V Operations and Controls B Position Reporting For purposes of limit monitoring and aggregati on of Enrons consolidated trading results Enrons consolidated Daily P osition Report should include the Net Open Position MaturityGap Position profit or loss and potential exposure VaR for approved Commodity Groups consolidat ed across the company without regard to which business unit undertook the trading activity In those instances where limits are granted to a business unit for a basket of commodities reporting for individual commodity risk books shall be maintained to facilitate aggregation of Enrons actual consolidated commodity specific exposure Management reporting may separately provide business unit sublimit monitoring and trading results aggregated according to management lines E Transaction Approval and Execution Only those employees designated by the Enron Corp Chief Risk Officer or his designees will be authorized to enter into Transactions on behalf of Enron The Chief Risk Officer must al so maintain a record of those employees responsible for the individual Commodi ty Groups Commodity Group Manager as specified in the Appendices Individua ls will be assigned as commodity leaders to manage Enrons aggregate positi on across the company as determined necessary by the Chief Risk Officer VI Policy Amendment Authority B CrossCommodity Position Authorization If in the ordinary course of it s business an Enron Business Unit or trading desk incurs an exposure to an underlying commodity or financial instrument for which it does not have explicit authority to carry this exposure should be hedged internally with the appropriate Enron desks with appropriate notification to the Chief Risk Officer or his designees Hedge positions should be in instruments that have an observable correlation with the underlying exposure and shoul d be rebalanced regularly to substantially neutralize the underlying exposure Upon notification to the Chief Risk Officer or his designees the Enron Business Unit Office of the Chairman who has authority for that commodity group may authorize a specific trader in a different commodity group to tak e speculative positions with other Enron trading desks in commodities andor financial instruments other than those which that trader has explicit authority to trade ie the Business Unit Office of the Chairman for North American Natural Gas may authorize a trader in the Coal group to trade gas with the North American Natural Gas desk For limit monitoring purposes of Enrons consolidated trading results these crosscommodity positions shall be captured by individual commodity to facilitate aggregation and reporting of Enrons consolidated exposure by commodity in the Daily Pos ition Report Coal desks gas position will be aggregated with the North Ameri can Natural Gas commodity group If you have any questions feel free to

<137761.1075849826105.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,cassandra.schultz@enron.com,2001-04-05 10:48:00,Your Help Needed Please CrossCommodity Reporting Cc the long email below I knew wed never get a chance to all get together and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Finance Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next week and it will include trading results for the st quarter reported in accordance with the risk management policy Due to issues noted below this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can I talked to Beth already and MRM met with Chris Abels group to see if there was a short cut but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BOD Well probably need to go with our best estimate of s as of end of the day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest As you recall the February th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification that the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure management reporting can be different of course Chris Abels global energy operations group has prepared a RAC DPR that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy so that top management and the BOD can see Enrons exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis A This DPR will not impact actual sharing of PL from a management reportingbusiness unit perspective this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the BOD But commercial management will need to review and sign off on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly as these limits are at an Enron level The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first quarter PL and average daily VaR by commodity group The first RAC DPR available is as of so while it has cumulative PL VaR is only as of Note were also comparing to Q but were not going to attempt to resolve crosscommodity reporting for that period except at a high level Your participation is needed in resolving crosscommodity reporting per the new RAC DPR both retroactively for the st quarter and going forward and ROVAR return on average daily VaR by commodity group for the st quarter This aggregation of crosscommodity activity has been completed by Chris as of so he has what he believes to be PL aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy What we dont have is VaR on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on Obviously were not going to be able to go back and calculate daily VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner especially within a week So it appears well need to swag average daily VaR by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at by considering crosscommodity activity youre aware of that took place throughout the quarter and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for this cross commodity activity Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident were reporting to the BOD in accordance with the policy And since we only have a few days I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues and then you and Chris group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit When you consider materiality please involve your Market Risk contact while a transactionpositionbook may not be material to gas or power it may be material to Global Products Weather etc Would you please help us with the following Confirm your review of Chris aggregation on the RAC DPR at Chris staff can walk you through are all the crosscommodity positions youre aware of being reported correctly is there other crosscommodity activity not present at and consequently not aggregated for the quarters results but actually present during the first quarter and material If so estimate impact on PL and average daily VaR were not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel and if they point on specific material transactions we can address those you can determine best approach are there certain books in RisktRAC that have crosscommodity positions imbeddedcombined either held currently or those that generated significant VaR or PL during the quarter Going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial Once youve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RAC DPR and per your own knowledge help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities average daily VaR for the quarter you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable swag approach After considering the information above please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the crosscommodity activity and if not identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter please feel free to pursue those I do not mean to imply I know how to do your jobs or that youre not doing them I simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the s we report to the BOD are the numbers you agree with and that if theyre not completely accurate given recent implementation that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement if any As you are the experts on your businesses results I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM understand regarding your reporting of the crosscommodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy On a separate note we need you to identify PL related to special transactions that flowed through the DPR but do not really represent trading activity examples in the past are SFAS transactions and other unique gainloss events were reporting Q and Q so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered We will be sending you a reconciliation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any special adjustments and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity These adjustments should be minimal but wed like your input to conclude Thank you for your cooperation Regards Cassandra Schultz x cell home A For example North American Electricity limits represent Enrons consolidated NA Electricity trading activity without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions So if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons these gas trades need to be removed from Power VaR and PL and combined with Gas VaR and PL etc Heating oil positions held outside Global Products should be aggregated with Global Products Global Products positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power with corresponding adjustment to Global Products results

continue to help in understanding the violations I recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems the UK DPR issues the increased limit change and policy compliance activity etc My suggestions were meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier I was offering to be the bad guy and point out to the traders what we want them to do and meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits I think the confusion here is violation explanations being validated by the traders as you indicated below vs provided by the traders as we envision I confirmed with Ted the traders are accountable for providing the explanation Im not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier Were suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations It should be the traders responsibility to get them to you and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading and should be able to easily explain why theyre in violation or why they had a big loss Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail or they talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you whatever you think makes sense and works for you Im not trying to manage the process just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point At this point in this long series of emails why dont we just talk face to face I can tell from your response you feel were somehow not being team players but that is not my intent at all Ive tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and appreciates your efforts And really I thought I was helping by using the policys influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate We can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RACs expectations I agree we do have significant midoffice needs and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by Skilling We can continue to work on streamlining processes but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities Im willing to do whatever is needed and I dont think Ted is hung up on who does what either Its just that right now were staffed with the expectation that Sallys group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems Best Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on PM From Shona Wilson PM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Process Dear Cassandra Thanks for the message I believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson

errors made buy us one in the template itself and some suggestions At your request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you

few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at

Enron Announcements To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Organizational Changes We are making a number of significant organizational changes These change s are intended to accomplish four key objectives First we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu l business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position Second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships Particularly with Joe Suttons departure the ability to directly manage the daytoday activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult Third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromisin g the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our loweryieldin g asset positions And fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES Today we are forming Enron Wholesale Services EWS which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses The closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension o f Enrons wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an d markets Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American European including Japan and Australia Global Markets and Industrial Markets operations and will be expanded to

<22813873.1075849847106.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,cassandra.schultz@enron.com,2001-04-05 10:48:00,Your Help Needed Please CrossCommodity Reporting Cc the long email below I knew wed never get a chance to all get together and this is somewhat urgent as I have to complete the Finance Committee presentation for the upcoming BOD meeting by the end of next week and it will include trading results for the st quarter reported in accordance with the risk management policy Due to issues noted below this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can I talked to Beth already and MRM met with Chris Abels group to see if there was a short cut but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the BOD Well probably need to go with our best estimate of s as of end of the day next Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest As you recall the February th BOD meeting resulted in a clarification that the BOD approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure management reporting can be different of course Chris Abels global energy operations group has prepared a RAC DPR that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy so that top management and the BOD can see Enrons exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis A This DPR will not impact actual sharing of PL from a management reportingbusiness unit perspective this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the BOD But commercial management will need to review and sign off on the RAC DPR and monitor limits accordingly as these limits are at an Enron level The specific trading results we need for the BOD presentation are the first quarter PL and average daily VaR by commodity group The first RAC DPR available is as of so while it has cumulative PL VaR is only as of Note were also comparing to Q but were not going to attempt to resolve crosscommodity reporting for that period except at a high level Your participation is needed in resolving crosscommodity reporting per the new RAC DPR both retroactively for the st quarter and going forward and ROVAR return on average daily VaR by commodity group for the st quarter This aggregation of crosscommodity activity has been completed by Chris as of so he has what he believes to be PL aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy What we dont have is VaR on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on Obviously were not going to be able to go back and calculate daily VaR for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner especially within a week So it appears well need to swag average daily VaR by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at by considering crosscommodity activity youre aware of that took place throughout the quarter and using our best estimate of the impact on VaR for this cross commodity activity Due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident were reporting to the BOD in accordance with the policy And since we only have a few days I thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues and then you and Chris group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit When you consider materiality please involve your Market Risk contact while a transactionpositionbook may not be material to gas or power it may be material to Global Products Weather etc Would you please help us with the following Confirm your review of Chris aggregation on the RAC DPR at Chris staff can walk you through are all the crosscommodity positions youre aware of being reported correctly is there other crosscommodity activity not present at and consequently not aggregated for the quarters results but actually present during the first quarter and material If so estimate impact on PL and average daily VaR were not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel and if they point on specific material transactions we can address those you can determine best approach are there certain books in RisktRAC that have crosscommodity positions imbeddedcombined either held currently or those that generated significant VaR or PL during the quarter Going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial Once youve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the RAC DPR and per your own knowledge help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities average daily VaR for the quarter you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable swag approach After considering the information above please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the crosscommodity activity and if not identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details If you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter please feel free to pursue those I do not mean to imply I know how to do your jobs or that youre not doing them I simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the s we report to the BOD are the numbers you agree with and that if theyre not completely accurate given recent implementation that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement if any As you are the experts on your businesses results I simply wanted to make sure I closed the loop with what we in MRM understand regarding your reporting of the crosscommodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy On a separate note we need you to identify PL related to special transactions that flowed through the DPR but do not really represent trading activity examples in the past are SFAS transactions and other unique gainloss events were reporting Q and Q so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered We will be sending you a reconciliation from the DPR to the BOD package that we use to document any special adjustments and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the DPR reporting to derive true trading activity These adjustments should be minimal but wed like your input to conclude Thank you for your cooperation Regards Cassandra Schultz x cell home A For example North American Electricity limits represent Enrons consolidated NA Electricity trading activity without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions So if Power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons these gas trades need to be removed from Power VaR and PL and combined with Gas VaR and PL etc Heating oil positions held outside Global Products should be aggregated with Global Products Global Products positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power with corresponding adjustment to Global Products results

continue to help in understanding the violations I recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems the UK DPR issues the increased limit change and policy compliance activity etc My suggestions were meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier I was offering to be the bad guy and point out to the traders what we want them to do and meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits I think the confusion here is violation explanations being validated by the traders as you indicated below vs provided by the traders as we envision I confirmed with Ted the traders are accountable for providing the explanation Im not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier Were suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations It should be the traders responsibility to get them to you and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading and should be able to easily explain why theyre in violation or why they had a big loss Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail or they talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you whatever you think makes sense and works for you Im not trying to manage the process just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point At this point in this long series of emails why dont we just talk face to face I can tell from your response you feel were somehow not being team players but that is not my intent at all Ive tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and appreciates your efforts And really I thought I was helping by using the policys influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate We can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RACs expectations I agree we do have significant midoffice needs and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by Skilling We can continue to work on streamlining processes but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities Im willing to do whatever is needed and I dont think Ted is hung up on who does what either Its just that right now were staffed with the expectation that Sallys group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems Best

Notifications Process Dear Cassandra Thanks for the message I believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson AM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Comments Dear Cassandra In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us one in the template itself and some suggestions At your request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you have certain requests and requirements it would be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to ensure it meets your requirements Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be Thanks Shona To Michael NRON Chris CT Shona nron Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Comments I realize this has already gone out but I see a few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level Veronica will call you to coordinate redistribution Going forward we need to increase our level of review for these as theyre getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our

continue to help in understanding the violations I recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems the UK DPR issues the increased limit change and policy compliance activity etc My suggestions were meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier I was offering to be the bad guy and point out to the traders what we want them to do and meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits I think the confusion here is violation explanations being validated by the traders as you indicated below vs provided by the traders as we envision I confirmed with Ted the traders are accountable for providing the explanation Im not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier Were suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations It should be the traders responsibility to get them to you and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading and should be able to easily explain why theyre in violation or why they had a big loss Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail or they talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you whatever you think makes sense and works for you Im not trying to manage the process just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point At this point in this long series of emails why dont we just talk face to face I can tell from your response you feel were somehow not being team players but that is not my intent at all Ive tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and appreciates your efforts And really I thought I was helping by using the policys influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate We can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RACs expectations I agree we do have significant midoffice needs and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by Skilling We can continue to work on streamlining processes but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities Im willing to do whatever is needed and I dont think Ted is hung up on who does what either Its just that right now were staffed with the expectation that Sallys group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems Best Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on PM From Shona Wilson PM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Process Dear Cassandra Thanks for the message I believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson

early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at

<13511818.1075849858522.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,cassandra.schultz@enron.com,2000-12-07 08:44:00,Re Limit Violations and Notifications Process Cc RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course well continue to help in understanding the violations I recognize and sympathize with the strain your group is under with all the systems problems the UK DPR issues the increased limit change and policy compliance activity etc My suggestions were meant to streamline the process for you by making your data gathering process easier I was offering to be the bad guy and point out to the traders what we want them to do and meant to strengthen the effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits I think the confusion here is violation explanations being validated by the traders as you indicated below vs provided by the traders as we envision I confirmed with Ted the traders are accountable for providing the explanation Im not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back to your efforts of getting memos out earlier Were suggesting the traders should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning so that you do not have to go through all the effort as you do now of trying to track people down in the afternoon and get explanations It should be the traders responsibility to get them to you and they should be reviewing their positions every morning before they even begin trading and should be able to easily explain why theyre in violation or why they had a big loss Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail or they talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you whatever you think makes sense and works for you Im not trying to manage the process just to help design one that makes it easier for you and is still effective from a risk management stand point At this point in this long series of emails why dont we just talk face to face I can tell from your response you feel were somehow not being team players but that is not my intent at all Ive tried to go out of my way the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and appreciates your efforts And really I thought I was helping by using the policys influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate We can talk about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RACs expectations I agree we do have significant midoffice needs and you have been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk reporting is required every day by Skilling We can continue to work on streamlining processes but maybe we need to think about staffing in our respective groups and corresponding responsibilities Im willing to do whatever is needed and I dont think Ted is hung up on who does what either Its just that right now were staffed with the expectation that Sallys group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of activities related to our risk management systems Best Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on PM From Shona Wilson PM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Process Dear Cassandra Thanks for the message I believe it if fully understood by us and the individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the traders Are you in addition saying that your group who has been very helpful in the past will no longer help us understand the cause of violationsnotifications To me this appears contrary to a team spirit attitude and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed earlier today Also we are working toward getting the memos out earlier and this is a real set back to that process Thoughts To Shona nron Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Process Shona To share with the others our telephone discussion the notification template was not my request it was requested directly by Skilling I know your group is working hard to meet mangagement expectations and in accordance with your request below Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until you are comfortable with the reporting requirements The new PL notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect next Tuesday should dramatically decrease the number of notifications so that should help It probably makes sense to redistribute the policy to your business unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation explanations These should be provided to you by the head trader of that commodity group Under the policy that commodity group manager is responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the commodities under his responsibility along with the head of the energy ops for that commodity group If the traders are not providing these explanations to you or to your counterparts ops desk head business unit controller Ill be happy to send them an email explaining their compliance obligation under the policy Why dont you talk to each of the business unit controllers consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback as I understand it is for Global Products for example and if youd like me to send an email to whoever youre having difficulty with I will just let me know who Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their explanations but the problem is they can see whether theyre short or long and how the market moved in comparison but its the trader that can and should explain why they took a position whether theyre adjusting it based on the market moves etc Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process Regards Cassandra Forwarded by Cassandra SchultzNAEnron on AM From Shona Wilson AM To Cassandra nron cc Michael NRON Chris CT Daniel NRON Veronica CT Sally CT Subject Re Limit Violations and Notifications Comments Dear Cassandra In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us one in the template itself and some suggestions At your request we have started to prepare this in addition to the normal word violationnotification memos and our other work As you have certain requests and requirements it would be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to ensure it meets your requirements Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be Thanks Shona To Michael NRON Chris CT Shona nron Daniel NRON cc Veronica CT Subject Limit Violations and Notifications Comments I realize this has already gone out but I see a few errors that we should correct and actually I think we should call Skilling and Lays and Buys assistants Veronica will handle this and see if we can just hand deliver to them a corrected version early this morning email is OK for Ted David and I I have a few other suggestions on formatreporting changes as well The NA Power VaR of MM was not over its VaR limit of that would have been to require a report to Skilling but if we had had to report it dont use WSCC try to spell out or just dont use UK Gass VaR limit is not its MM I cant tie in UK Gas QTD and YTD PL shouldnt it be whats on the DPR adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas call over to that Yeo person and get the info from them please The nd item for NA Gas shouldnt be listed like that as it looks like another violation the comment re the VaR increase was mean to go at the bottom under RAC comments The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg VaR is not its notification requirement box EES had a VaR violation vs that is a Skilling level violation Lets have the Re say Limit Violations and Notifications for December Lets number them all sequentially rather than starting over at

Is this straight off a daily report from Accounting What does this represent and what do we want in the policy which individual is going to provide this daily and when Borrowing Capacity I defined this by pulling terms straight from the slide in the Joint Au ditFinance Committee presentation do you agree who is going to calculate this daily and provide to RAC and by when Potential Future Cash

like all the other market risk m etrics Please call me in the morning so I can run through any required changes Regards Cassandra Risk Measurement for LiquidityFunding Risk Liquidityfunding risk focuses on whether the Company is able to raise enou gh capital whether through debt equity or counterparty collateral to me et its cash and collateral requirements and is a function of funding liqui dity and position liquidity Margin deposits received and margin deposits required under the Companys Trading Portfolio have a significant impact on the Companys funding requirements and are often determined by changes in commodity prices Position liquidity refers to the extent to which a posi tion can be liquidated quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting the positions price Key determinants of the liquidity of a pos ition and the cost of liquidation include a the level of thirdparty int erest and market activity in the asset b the time period available to co nvert the asset to cash c the size value or volumes of the asset and d perception of the Company in the marketplace Active management of fun ding requirements and capital availability should minimize funding shortfal ls See Section for the limit structure and reporting guidelines The Liquidity Exposure Ratio Liquidity Ratio is the primary metric of t he Companys liquidityfunding risk to be implemented under a transition pe riod determined by the Risk Management Committee The Liquidity Ratio shal l be calculated daily over a specified time period by dividing a the sum of the Companys i Future Available Cash and ii Borrowing Capacity by b the Companys Potential Future Cash Requirements Future Available Cas h shall represent the Companys current cashflow forecast as determined by the Accounting department considering operating and investing activities Borrowing Capacity shall be determined by the Treasury department and sh all be calculated as the sum of a commercial paper b uncommitted bank lines and loan sales lines c letter of credit facilities d accounts receivable e shelf registrations for public debt issues and f shelf r egistrations for public equity issues Potential Future Cash Requirements shall be calculated by the Trading Portfolios risk systems and shall repre sent a simulation of margin exposure and collateral requirements for the Tr ading Portfolio Liquidity stress testing shall be performed periodically as determined by the Chief Risk Officer to quantify the liquidityfunding risks associated with specific positions Such stress testing may include specific asset li quidity stress tests to quantify the risks associated with illiquid positio ns Results of liquidity stress testing will be made available to the CEO and to other parties at the discretion of the Chief Risk Officer Capital Associated with LiquidityFunding Risk Liquidityfunding risk arises from the potential that funding requirements will exceed funding availability for a given time period Funding requirem ents may vary over time as a result of a exchange margin requirements c ollateral obligations and collateral receivables primarily related to Tradi ng Portfolio activities b new investments c the payment of interest a nd dividends and d the maturing of debt and other obligations Funding availability may vary over time as a result of a available cash b acc ess to capital markets c available collateral and d the time required to convert positions to cash or liquid assets The Company shall use the Liquidity Ratio liquidity stress testing and oth er methods as

Enron Corp Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy the Policy on August and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at resources without market risk limits due to confidentiality The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed a market risk b credit risk c operational risk and d liquidityfunding risk and this summary is attached to this email for your convenience The credit policy was incorporated without change and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities This email message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Companys market risk management practices which may be of interest The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp During this transition period existing Commodity Group Limits as of August th remain in effect and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business units activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management Regards Cassandra Schultz Vice President RAC Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices In addition to consolidating Enrons various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Companys market risk management practices as summarized below Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio providing discretion to the Enron Corp CEO CEO to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee a Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors b Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO Risk Management Committee c Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO Risk Management Committee d TraderDesk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman Key Points re the Limit Structure Concentration Limits are established on large buckets of commodity groups this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective not according to Enrons organizational structure Americas Gas Americas Power European Gas Power Products Financials and Emerging Businesses o Examples Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit CEORisk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric and accordingly an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC but no limit is set Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit ie Enron Americas Enron Global Markets Enron Europe etc any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level representing the individual Business Units authority for trading specific commodities every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a pure commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish TraderDesk Level Limits andor related risk reporting as they require enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business ie the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined etc Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level and individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits Limit Monitoring and Reporting All position and VaR violations are triggered at of the respective limit All Daily Loss notifications are triggered at of the VaR limit All Cumulative day Loss notifications are triggered at of the VaR limit Trading Portfolio limit monitoring reported to the Board Concentration limit monitoring reported up to the CEO and at Board meetings Business Unit and Commodity Group limit monitoring reported up to the Risk Management Committee TraderDesk Level Limits and related reporting to be established by each business unit Overall Portfolio Structure Expanded the Trading Portfolio includes all of Enrons marktomarket trading activity including speculative trading of PGE and ETS Merchant Portfolio does not have established limits Clarified that the Capital Portfolio is to capture and manage all positions related to Enrons capital structure the VaR limit established is a Concentration Limit for Enron stock related transactions as other positions are captured and measured additional limits may be established as needed Added a new Regulated Portfolio for certain transportation and distribution activities a VaR limit was established by the Board for PGEs regulated activities Added a new Other Assets Contracts Portfolio to capture and manage accrual or other type of positions not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios no limits established

know what exactly thats for whether Im covered and why I might even need it Another thing Id like to know is who else at Enron is listed as an officer of EPMI And also Sara Shackleton discovered last week that the Enron BOD did not actually approve me being designated as a RAC officer so Im wondering if the slate of officers for EPMI that was submitted to California for the regulatory requirements is invalid Evidently the change from Ted Murphy to me was overlooked in the paperwork approved by the BOD meeting and the plan is to ratify it retrospectively in this next BOD meeting This isnt something that keeps me up at night but it is of concern to my husband especially since I am unable to explain the significance and potential exposure if any of being named an officer of these subsidiaries Thanks for your help Cassandra x Original Message From mailto Sent Thursday July PM To Schultz Cassandra Subject no subject SACRAMENTO Calif July Reuters A California legislative panel voted Wednesday to ask the state Senate to cite Reliant Energy Inc REIN for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted to move against Houstonbased Reliant which joins fellow Texas energy giant Enron Corp ENEN in facing what could be the first contempt citations imposed by Californias state senate since Senate aides said the panel which is investigating charges of market manipulation and price gouging in Californias energy crisis would now begin preparing a full report on Reliants noncompliance for the full Senate The committees report on Enron could be ready for submission to the full Senate Thursday they said adding that continued efforts to negotiate an agreement had proved fruitless According to state law Californias senators must use the reports to decide whether to slap sanctions on the two companies They also have the option of fining or imprisoning company senior officers Enron for its part has filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court challenging the investigative committees authority to subpoena company documents Senate aides said Reliant could follow the lead of another energy company Atlantabased Mirant Corp MIRN which has avoided the contempt threat by cooperating with legislators demands to sign confidentiality agreements open a document depository close to Sacramento and begin placing documents there relating to the companys recent business in California The committee also voted on Wednesday to suspend for days proceedings against number of other energy firms including Duke Energy Corp DUKN Dynegy Inc DYNN Williams Cos Inc WMBN AES Corp AESN and NRG Energy Inc NRGN pending a review of their compliance efforts to date Enron has argued the committee has no legal jurisdiction over wholesale electricity prices which are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee FERC and that the committees proceedings violate the companys legal rights State officials have accused the energy companies of overcharging California power agencies and utilities some billion for wholesale electricity over the past months which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the states poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the
