Catalytica Combustion Systems Inc a subsidiary of Catalytica Inc NASDAQ CTAL Kawasaki Motors Corp USA an affiliate of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Enron Energy Services Inc a subsidiary of Enron Corp NYSE ENE announced today their intent to furnish three Kawasaki MAX gas turbines for a distributed generation power project to be installed in the Northeastern United States The engines will be equipped with Catalyticas Xonon Cool Combustion technologythe only system that enables gas turbines to achieve ultralow emissions without the use of burdensome exhaust gas cleanup systems The project is expected to enter service in late Kawasakis commercial introduction of Xononequipped engines marks a milestone in Kawasakis program to expand the presence of its family of small gas turbines in the North American market Mr Hiro Matsumura general manager of the Kawasaki Motors Corp USA Gas Turbine Division stated We are pleased and excited that Enron has chosen us as a partner for this distributed generation project We believe that the combination of this proven reliable and costeffective engine with the unparalleled advantage of Xonons ultralow NOx performance will permit users to take advantage of the economies of onsite generation with virtually no environmental impact Catalytica Combustion Systems President and CEO Dennis Orwig said Xonons ultralow emissions will facilitate the siting of new power generation units in urban and suburban areas This should reduce both the need for new power transmission lines and the environmental impact of our power supplies He continued We are proud to be working with these two leading organizations to bring the benefits of clean reliable energy to the high growth distributed generation market Tom White vice chairman of Enron Energy Services commented Xonon is a key element of Enron Energy Services distributed generation solution to supplying clean energy to meet the increasing energy demands of the growing US economy Further Kawasakis products can effectively meet the challenging requirements of this emerging market and we expect that additional opportunities to use the MAX will be forthcoming Catalyticas Xonon Cool Combustion technology is a patented pollution prevention system that avoids the formation of nitrogen oxide NOx a primary contributor to smog by reducing localized combustion temperatures while achieving equivalent combustion efficiency and performance Xonon has demonstrated NOx emissions of well under parts per million ppm and it also dramatically reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons Xonon is the only combustion system demonstrated to meet California Air Resources Board and South Coast Air Quality Management District emissions guidelines for new gas turbines

Catalytica Combustion Systems Inc a subsidiary of Catalytica Inc NASDAQ CTAL Kawasaki Motors Corp USA an affiliate of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Enron Energy Services Inc a subsidiary of Enron Corp NYSE ENE announced today their intent to furnish three Kawasaki MAX gas turbines for a distributed generation power project to be installed in the Northeastern United States The engines will be equipped with Catalyticas Xonon Cool Combustion technologythe only system that enables gas turbines to achieve ultralow emissions without the use of burdensome exhaust gas cleanup systems The project is expected to enter service in late Kawasakis commercial introduction of Xononequipped engines marks a milestone in Kawasakis program to expand the presence of its family of small gas turbines in the North American market Mr Hiro Matsumura general manager of the Kawasaki Motors Corp USA Gas Turbine Division stated We are pleased and excited that Enron has chosen us as a partner for this distributed generation project We believe that the combination of this proven reliable and costeffective engine with the unparalleled advantage of Xonons ultralow NOx performance will permit users to take advantage of the economies of onsite generation with virtually no environmental impact Catalytica Combustion Systems President and CEO Dennis Orwig said Xonons ultralow emissions will facilitate the siting of new power generation units in urban and suburban areas This should reduce both the need for new power transmission lines and the environmental impact of our power supplies He continued We are proud to be working with these two leading organizations to bring the benefits of clean reliable energy to the high growth distributed generation market Tom White vice chairman of Enron Energy Services commented Xonon is a key element of Enron Energy Services distributed generation solution to supplying clean energy to meet the increasing energy demands of the growing US economy Further Kawasakis products can effectively meet the challenging requirements of this emerging market and we expect that additional opportunities to use the MAX will be forthcoming Catalyticas Xonon Cool Combustion technology is a patented pollution prevention system that avoids the formation of nitrogen oxide NOx a primary contributor to smog by reducing localized combustion temperatures while achieving equivalent combustion efficiency and performance Xonon has demonstrated NOx emissions of well under parts per million ppm and it also dramatically reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons Xonon is the only combustion system demonstrated to meet California Air Resources Board and South Coast Air Quality Management District emissions guidelines for new gas turbines without the use of an exhaust cleanup system Kawasaki Motors Corp USA Gas Turbine Division wwwkawasakicom located in Grand Rapids Michigan provides a full line of gas turbine packaging parts overhaul
