idea to send it to all of ENW anthony Original Message From Mahoney Peggy Sent Monday November AM To All NRON Subject What Enron Did Right A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today Managers Journal What Enron Did Right By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner The Wall Street Journal A Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc This is a rough era for American business icons Subject to the vagaries of age Jack Welch product failure FordFirestone tires competition Lucent ATT technology HewlettPackard and Compaq and dotbomb bubbles CMGI managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business The latest example is Enron whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy Once considered one of the countrys most innovative companies Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest The journalistic accounts of Enrons struggles drip with schadenfreude hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value Deregulation and market competition Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the US where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit Enron was the leader in pioneering this business Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the US and is spreading to Europe Latin America and Asia The winners have been consumers who have paid lower prices and investors who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient The contrary experience of California the poster child of those who would reregulate the power industry is an example of not enough deregulation Innovation and the deintegration of power contracts Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity customers were offered a onesizefitsall contract For many customers this system was inflexible and inefficient like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer To do this Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts starting with price and volume location time etc and offered customers choices on each one Again consumers won Enrons investors did too because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors Arguably Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the process of Creative Destruction But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable pleasant folks which may be part of Enrons problem today Minimization of transaction costs and frictions Enron extended the logic of deintegration to other industries An integrated paper company for instance owns forests mills pulp factories and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller specialized firms Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of customers and suppliers Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the freemarket terms would be better than those of the internal operations The development of freemarket benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy Exploiting the optionality in networks In the old regulated environment natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources opening the customer to the benefits of competition and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons This policy picked up by others in the industry created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers Rigorous risk assessment The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed and of very strong internal controls Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere Particularly with the advent of Enron Online where Enron made new positions valued at over billion each day it became essential to have uptothesecond information on companywide positions prices and ability to deliver The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm but with fears among trading partners about Enrons ability to finance its trading activity In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance It was the erosion in equity rather than trading risk that destroyed the firm A culture of urgency innovation and high expectations Enrons corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic hierarchical formal slow and full of excuses And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company Enron only years ago is even duller and slower Enron became bumptious impatient lean fast innovative and demanding It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses create markets and transfer within the firm Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion and an openoffice design fostered brainstorming The firms organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs This was a lightning rod for the firms detractors And yet it could serve as a model for more hidebound enterprises to emulate Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business It created a ruckus in oncequiet corners of the business economy It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business It thrived on volatility The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major RD establishment especially given Dynegys track record as a second mover following Enrons lead Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and timeconsuming antitrust review Dynegys greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enrons spirit of innovation its own Or so we all should hope because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries Messrs Bodily and Bruner are professors at the University of Virginias Graduate School of Business Administration
