<4542234.1075860837693.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,arthur.ransome@enron.com,2001-11-30 11:45:10,Thank you for a great experienceDear Ken Today I learned that effective midnight tonight I have been made redundant from my position in Enron Europe I have worked for Enron for the last years and I can say that despite what has happened today joining Enron was the best career move I made The past years have presented opportunities that were beyond my wildest dreams I appreciate everything that Enron has done for myself and my family and I leave believing that I did my best to return my gratefulness in some way While growing up in a worling class environment my father taught me two great lessons in life which I believe we all need to learn The first being that if you ever want anything in life then you had better work for it The second being that you should never understand the meaning of the word cant I believe that I have been able to follow his teaching in my career with Enron I leave Enron with tremendous experience and most of all a feeling of belonging to something that was once great I truly believed in the company and its people Indeed I have reminded myself daily over the last few weeks that Enrons success was built more on its intangible assets rather than its tangible assets Enrons greatness was built by its people because we all have dreams and ambitions to be a part of something great Although I leave the company with great sadness I also leave with a great feeling of thanks and appreciation Arthur Ransome Arthur Ransome Director Asset Management Enron Europe Limited Office Phone Puerto Rico Cellular Phone Puerto Rico
