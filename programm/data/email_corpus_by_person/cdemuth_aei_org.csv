weeks of the presidential campaign Vice President Gore is returning to the theme that Governor Bushs Texas has become an abysma l place to live It is a hard case to makeTexas is today the fifth fastest gr owing state and fifth in net influx of Americans from other states and Mr Bush is one of the nations most popular governors Mr Gores earlier attacks on the governors education record we re set aside following the July release of a comprehensive RAND study showing that Texas has become the nations top state in achievement test scores His subs equent assertions about the number of Texans lacking health insurance seem to have fizzled as well it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling in Texas while rising in the nation as a whole That leaves environmental quality where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla de of dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texass cities a nd streams Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and rhetoric Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables o ne can measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water and measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of monitors the use of peak versus average levels and adjustments for population exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects of different kinds of pollution Rankings among states are much more problematic than rankings of school performance or health care because all states that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution levels Texas accounts for percent of the nations petrochemical production capacity and percent of oil refining and it is the only stat e with two metropolitan areas Houston and DallasFt Worth among the nation s top ten Measured by simple gross quantities Texas California and New Jersey will have more pollution than most other states under any circumstances the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both er so much with the pollutioncontrol challenges Mr Gores charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt combining misleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an impression that bears little relationship to reality The charges are however easy to debunk and it is surprising that they been reported with little scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice Presidents loose ways with facts The Gore campaigns favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An geles to become the smog capital of the United States No in air pollution and the dirtiest city in the nation We will ignore Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrews claim that Houston has become the dir tiest city in the world which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for the latest party line The charge is false According to the US Environmental Protection Agency air quality in Houston is improving and is unambiguously better than in Los Angeles and is also better than in many other cities The Houston charge is based on city data on ambient levels of ozone one of six criteria air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act as measured by numbers of days of exceedencesof the EPAs national standard Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions especial ly temperature They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years an d other southern cities such as Atlanta but they fell sharply in Los Angele s in due to unusually cool summer weather As a result Houston topped L os Angeles and all other cities in ozone exceedencesbut its air qualit y was nevertheless better than LAs Houstons ozone level was perce nt higher than in Los Angeles but its particulates level was percent lower particulates are the other major component of smog and according to the EPA a far more serious health risk than ozone there is no separate measure of smog Houston did vastly better than LA for three of the four other Clean Air Act pollutants lower for nitrogen oxides lower for carb on monoxide and lower for lead the cities sulphur dioxide levels w ere identical While Houston was out of compliance with EPAs national st andard for only one pollutant ozone LA was out of compliance for three ozone particulates and carbon monoxide We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to demonstrate the falsity of Mr Gores allegation If Houston is not nu mber one in air pollution neither is it number two or even number six Houston is the nations sixth largest metropolitan area According to the EPA A ir Quality Index which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight s them according to the health risks of each air quality in Houston is bette r than in ten other metropolitan areas Houston also bests ten other cities o n a separate EPA index of ozone alone These data are for the most recent year available rankings for and will probably be similar A related charge and particularly egregious falsehood is Vice President Gores assertion that Governor Bush made key air pollution rules in T exas voluntary In Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with grandfathered sources of air pollution Under the Clean Air Act and almos t all state air pollution programs old power plants and industrial facilitie s are subject to much more lenient emissions standards than new ones It is a serious loophole that has been bad for the economy as well as the environme nt inducing firms to maintain old facilities both less efficient and more polluting than new ones for longer then they otherwise would and leading to protracted litigation over the difference between renovating an old facilit y and building a new one Under the legislation Texas became one of the first three states to begin closing the loophole through tighter standards for old facilities The step was praised by environmental groups and helped coax Mr Gore who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato r or Vice President to propose a national program of his own for old power plants Mr Bush has also advanced a national proposal But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative the law covering utilitie s enacted mandatory standards which will result in huge reductions in power plant emissions over the next three years but the law covering industrial facilities enacted a voluntary compliance schedule coupled with increased fees for noncompliance There is legitimate disagreement over just how effective the feeincentive program will turn out to be there have been so me initial reductions in the first year apparently of about tons of ai r pollution but the program is too recent to estimate likely future reductions What is not in dispute is that both the mandatory and voluntary prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and tightening of air pollution controlsand an innovation that powerful b usiness opposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states Nor is it disputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate s may significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a re worth a try indeed that is precisely the approach of the Vice President s national proposal for old utilities which consists not of mandatory standards but voluntary tax incentives For Mr Gorea selfdescribed environmentalist and reformernow to turn on the Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution standards Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary is an act of striking mendacity His latest campaign ad adds a particularly ruthless twist it couples the made voluntary fabrication with the Houston air quality fabrication to produce a triple falsehoodthat air pollution g ot worse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards The Vice Presidents most plenary change is that under Governor Bush Texas has become last among all states in air quality No in industrial air pollution and No in water pollution Although the Gore campaign has occasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by environmental groups its primary and only official source for these claims is an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory The TRI however is not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of environmental quality at all Instead it measures releases of certain substances that the EPA classifies as toxicand releases includes no t only those that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly disposed of through EPAapproved hazardous waste management and water treatment practices The agencys annual TRI reports warn that its est imates reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals not exposures of the public to those chemicals and that they are not sufficie nt to determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr Gores assertions But even in their own terms they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice President would like voters to believe Texas has always been near the top of the various TRI ratings reflecting the states huge share of national petrochemical and refining capacity But it did not become No in the overall ranking under Governor Bush as the Gore campaign insinuates Rathe r Texas was No under Mr Bushs predecessor Democratic Governor Ann Richards and it has improved significantly since he took office The EPA s release of TRI data through noted that Texas the state with the largest productionrelated waste managed in was also the state projecting the largest absolute reduction over the next two years T he data for released earlier this year shows Texas leading the nation i n reduction of toxic releaseswith million pounds eliminated between the first year of Mr Bushs governorship and The new report a lso finds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment and second in onsite recycling Due in part to these improvements Texas h as now dropped from first to fifth place in the TRI composite index Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according to virtually every useful measure Here are a few selected statistics of our own According to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission industrial air emissions in Texas fell from through Accordin g to the EPA ambient air quality in Texas improved for five of the six national air pollutants for the same period all Texas cities but one now meet the national standards for four or more of the six pollutants the exception El Paso due to crossborder pollution from Mexico and half of Texass cities are now below the national average for all six pollutan ts According to the EPA Texass proportion of rivers and streams classif ied as impaired is better than the national average And according to Environmental Defense which prepares a comprehensive index of water qualit y aggregating Clean Water Act pollution measures Texas is not No in water pollution but No its overall water quality is better than i n other states Governor Bush does not get all of the credit for this record it is also d ue to the progressive tightening of national environmental standards and perhaps even more to progressive improvements in production technologies But he gets a share of it due to his own decisions and those of his appointees And in several critical areas of environmental policy he has been a national leaderclosing the old plants
