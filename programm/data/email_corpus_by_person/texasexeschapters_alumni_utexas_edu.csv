Stillwater was fun We had several hundred people at the tailgate and by the middle of the rd quarter I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma Aggies All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is Im glad we do not return for years Brutal Absolutely brutal Texas looked a little sloppy early but righted the ship to cruise on course Oklahoma State had a solid game plan but the Texas adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys The running game reappeared this week and freshman studtobe Cedric Benson got his st career start He did not disappoint El Ced finished the day with yards on carries His solid running opened up the passing lanes for Simms and Co who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary to the tune of touchdown passes All in all the muchanticipated OU hangover did not come to pass Texas took care of the weaker opponent as they should have Colorado pm ABC telecast ESPN Gameday the radio edition not the tv show will be here for the game Texas comes in ranked and CU comes in ranked This is a game both teams need to validate their seasons Texas needs to show the world and themselves that they can indeed win a big game A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a probable win season no offense Aggies while a loss could send this team into a tailspin Colorado much like Texas is a different team at home They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder but now must show they have grown up and can win on the road This is a HUGE game If the horns hold serve they should sail into College Station with a BCS birth on the line This will not be easy Texas has not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does The Buffs are in the Big XII in the nation in rushing offense ypg National tv coverage temperature in the high s top teams getting after it I wouldnt want it any other way There will be no television for the Missouri game The Texas Athletic Department has asked the Missouri AD to allow a payperview

polls I said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business things would shake out for them Its sort of setting up that way isnt it weeks ago Texas was with unbeatens in front of them In the last days half of those teams have lost Of the now in front play each other in the next weeks and the other have VERY tricky games Florida vs Georgia UCLA vs Oregon The horns are right there in it Hello shovel pass Texas won a big game Okay not THE big game but A big game nonetheless The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping their chests about their rushing game and physical defense and left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact Texas forced turnovers tying a season high OSU shutting down the Buffalo ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of yards total offense On to the shovel pass Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass because they only did it a few times in the Spring If you did see them try it in the Spring your heart was in your throat like mine when they ran it on their own because it was never what you would call a good play in practice I think they tried it times and totaled something like minus yards and one interception Nonetheless Simms sucked them in Ced got the corner and Roy sprung him to midfield Two plays later One being a fade to Roy that was maybe Simms best throw this year touchdown That was absolutely a soulstealing drive If there is a team in college football better at putting someone away right before the half than Texas I havent seen them Missouri pm No TV Well the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for you The reason the payperview didnt work is the way it was set up Texas residents would pay to see it but it would be regionally televised in Missouri That sounds fair right Okay now no one gets to see it Oh well listen to the Texas game and watch OU play Nebraska For those of you going to Missouri it should be fun Mizzou has played pretty well in the last weeks but its hard to get scared of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME Bowling Green Are you kidding me Anyway look for those not going listen for Texas to run run run this week Missouri cannot stop the run allowing ypg so Texas will exploit that Last year Roy Williams ran loose in the Tiger secondary and Applewhite found him repeatedly catches yds I see no reason for this to change particularly when Mizzou will have to put on the line of scrimmage to stop the run The tEXas tailgate will be at Spankys Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn in Columbia The tailgate will begin at am and run until roughly pm The bar will be

Saturday night at the erector set they call Robertson Stadium As I watched the game from the stands I heard some complaints from the Texas fans around me I do not and will not ever understand how a team you support can be winning those games by an average score of be ranked in the top in both major polls and be in contention for a national title yet still have fans unhappy Do I think the team played perfect Saturday night No Do I think they have things to work on Yes Was I ecstatic that Texas put half of a hundred on the scoreboard against an opponent on the road You bet Do I think this team is improving every week Absolutely This game was like just about every game played this weekend sloppy Penalties and missed opportunities were present for both teams early The superior talent and depth proved to be the difference in this game The Longhorns simply are a better team than UH is right now and that showed Whatever you might think of the Athletic Department and Administration of UH Im right there with you their football team is well coached and plays tough Chris Simms looked like the manchild everyone was expecting from day He finished the night a cool for yards and touchdowns He was picked off once put UH got nothing out of it Some passes were dropped and another touchdown pass to Tony Jeffrey was ruled incomplete but replays later showed it was a catch He looked off receivers well once on the yard td pass to BJ Johnson scrambled when he had to and really only made or bad decisions The passing game has arrived It is widely known that the most improvement in a team is from game to game That was game for the passing game The ITrain was a wrecking ball Williams had yards and touchdowns on carries and did not see the field in the th quarter He gave way to Benson who racked up yards and a score on carries Thats almost yards per carry for the game Most impressive was the rd and short yardage situations where Texas fans have cringed in the past Each time it was nd or rd and short the horns lined up in their tight end set and everyone in the stadium knew what the play was and where it was going It still worked yards per carry Statistically the defense has had better days They gave up yards and points Some points of concern are the lack of a consistent pass rush and some sloppy tackling but the rest must be laid at the feet of UH The Cougars had an excellent game plan for Texas and had weeks to implement it This was their OU game They had games of film on Texas who had only one with no relevance since it was of Rice and their wishbone atack that Texas hasnt used in years Houston played lights out in the st half Two things coaches must do are get their team prepared for the game and adjust to the opponent at the half Texas led at the half At the end of the rd quarter it was The Texas coaches fixed the immediate problem and stopped Houston when it had to Like I said earlier the biggest improvement for a team is from game to game This was game for defending the wideopen offense Texas Tech pm Fox Sports This should be a fun one folks Tech has a chip on their shoulder because they think they let one get away last year in Lubbock when Texas walked out of their with a win Texas Tech comes in after beating that bully North Texas who they had previously split the last meetings with This is about as one sided a rivalry as it gets with Texas leading the games played The Red Raiders have a solid quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury and a great playmaker in safety Kevin Curtis If they could block someone offensively and stop the run on defense they could be pretty good Its not happening here Eat a big lunch because the way these teams throw the ball and the way Techs offensive line blocks expect a lot of incompletions and holding penalties Its going to be a long night INFORMATION FOR TICKET HOLDERS Expect long lines and delays at stadium gates which will open two hours prior to kickoff in order to accommodate sellout crowds Police officers are scheduled to patrol the stadium block the day and night prior to the games An increased number of security officers are scheduled to man each gate For more information about the

I do mean EVERYBODY I think that even I had a few carries and my wife had a sack Good to see Major get one more score and then launch the ball rows into the student section There is no football game this weekend but there is plenty going on with the Longhorns The basketball season opens the TJ Ford Era on Saturday as the horns face giant killer Arizona who already has beaten Maryland and Florida all with replacing NBAbound starters If you are around Austin Saturday get yourself to the basketball game Lets make it as hard to play in the Drum as it is in DKR There is that little matter of OU going out to Lubbock to play Tech on Saturday as well Get your guns up Longhorns What can I say about this COMPLETE DOMINATION Utterly complete The horns rolled up yards total offense all three quarterbacks accounted for touchdowns every single player who is not redshirting played The Defense seems to be getting nastier each week The Jayhawks had yards of total offense yards The closest they got to the endzone was the Texas Special teams standout Michael Ungar outscored Kansas all by himself with a safety of the Jayhawk punter who bobbled the snap in the endzone Ungar beat Kansas Texas also had another safety when Marcus Tubbs sacked quarterback Mario Kinsey in the endzone so I guess Tubbs beat Kansas too If Texas wanted to score on Saturday they would have made it so The Jayhawks in my opinion quit on their interim coach Saturday They came out flat played flat and were immediately flattened by a fired up Texas team ready to honor their seniors by getting all of them in the game The only down side to this game was the kickoff coverage Kansas seemed to get through the initial wall and get the ball close to midfield almost every time I think this was due to two things The kickoff coverage team was looking for the knockout blow that would make SportsCenter They were all exhausted from covering kicks in the game I think this problem was unique to the blowout and will correct itself by the Aggie game If thats my worst complaint then I guess its a good day The BCS OU vs Tech Bowl Theories Lets talk about the BCS for a minute Ive heard from some of you that you dont like the BCS I concur I dont see how they can tell a team it must play in a major conference to be eligible BYU will be snubbed due to this and then amend the rules to filter it fairly See only teams from one conference can play in the BCS The BCS was installed to eliminate the bias of voters and make sure the best teams make it to the top bowls With that being said how can the NCAA use this system and then turn around and say Oh Im sorry but we can only have teams from one conference teams would allow too much money to go to one conference and thats not fair Excuse me Why does it have to be fair here Is it fair that Notre Dame has its own TV deal with NBC while better teams never get seen They make A LOT of money that other schools dont Is it fair that one BCSfactoring poll in Seattle has a Pac team at and an Atlantabased poll has an SEC team Oregon and Florida have both jumped Texas in the BCS this week Maybe the Dallas Morning News should start a BCS poll to even the score with its own polling methods Its not fair anywhere in college football its not supposed to be The Big shouldnt be guaranteed a team in the BCS if they cant produce in the top penalizing another that has No conference should College football is eliminate the weak and the strong survive so why be fair in deciding a national champion It is a shame that Texas Oklahoma or Nebraska will get left out so it will be fair I will get off of my soapbox Like I stated earlier get your guns up people I am officially jumping on the Texas Tech bandwagon now One way please and Id like a window seat maybe in the emergency exit row Theres plenty of room for everybody The Sooners are point favorites in Lubbock this weekend but it should be fun to watch Kliff with a K throwing it all over the place We really NEED this game If Tech can pull this off Texas plays the Aggies for the right to go to Dallas If Tech loses then Texas has to hope Nebraska beats OU in the Big XII Championship Game and the horns get the BCS nod over the loss Sooners which could happen Prepare yourself for this Texas will not make the BCS If OU wins out and beats Nebraska in Dallas those will certainly make it to the BCS In that case Texas will end up in Dallas in the Cotton Bowl vs an SEC team Ole Miss or Auburn I know this isnt the place most of us want to go but it might be where we do go Now Dallas isnt exactly the endofseason goal that Texas had in mind but they will shake it off and play where they are sent Many of you and I do mean many have proposed theories and explanations to me as to why the horns would end up BCSless the soft schedule starting the wrong quarterback the wrong tailback not throwing deep not running up the middle and on and on Some of these are solid valid reasons that I cannot argue with and some are not Whatever the case no one can change what has might happened but we can all affect the future The Cotton Bowl is a major bowl on New Years Day national telecast against a quality team I for one would love to rinse that Arkansas taste out of my mouth It will be hard for me to complain about an season and a final ranking after a big win over Ole Miss in Dallas I think most of you like me think of the sour ending to the season and associate that with the Cotton Bowl Dont It isnt and we will not be there because we limped to the finish like then we will be there as arguably the best team in the country and winners of straight no offense Ags who were snubbed due to a technicality Dallas is close Dallas is fun Again I will get off of my soapbox Here are the directions to

got their st no hitter since last season when Texas shut out Houston The yards allowed was the fewest since They also held their th straight opponent to under yards total offense The Longhorns have now won in a row at home The average score in those games is and Texas has scored over points in the last at DKR The Texas offense racked up yards on the Jayhawks It was the high mark for the season and the most yards the horns have produced since the yard output last year against Kansas Ouch Cedric Benson continues to excel Ced had yards rushing on carries and touchdowns and td and yards receiving on receptions Ceds broke the alltime game freshman rushing record for Texas Charles Hunter and his allpurpose yards are th on the alltime list and st for freshmen Can you say Big XII Offensive Freshman of the Year Chris Simms threw touchdown passes on Saturday breaking Major Applewhites school record of for a season Simms now has this season with game to go Roy Williams is good Roy W moved into nd place on the alltime touchdown receptions list The yarder marked his th career touchdown reception behind the leader Mike Adams This guy is a sophomore Yikes Place kicker Dusty Mangum had points xp fg to give him points for the day Mangum now has for the season making him the alltime leading scorer for a freshman Phil Dawson Wide out BJ Johnson extended his streak of games with a reception to which is a record to start a career He is behind the alltime leader of consecutive games with a catch Mike Adams Around the Conference Nice offense Ags The AM Aggies couldnt hold onto a point st quarter lead in Norman and were eventually blown out by OU The Aggie defense scored the only touchdown for AM as the farmer offense continues to struggle Once again the AM offense managed more points than I scored this weekend No more complaining about trick plays Coach Bob Coach Bob and some players blew up after they lost to Nebraska on the reverse pass for a touchdown to

With the exception of the NCAA Tournament this is my favorite time of the year Bowl season I will watch them all Every single one of them That New Orleans Bowl wow North Texas at makes a bowl You must be kidding right Colorado State put the wood to the Mean Green and I watched the whole thing The good news for the participants in the New Orleans Bowl You went to a bowl game The bad news Now you have to go back and take your finals The BCS Im not sure how in the world Nebraska ended up in the Rose Bowl If I am an Oregon fan I am livid The Ducks finished the year won the PAC and did everything that was asked of them and were left out Nebraska got pinned on them in late November and still got in Unacceptable The mantra of college football for years has been if you lose lose early unless youre Nebraska I dont think Colorado should be there either losses but at least they won the conference I figured out a little system within the BCS that might work and here it is Only conference champions are eligible for the national title Nebraska or Florida can still go to a BCS bowl but only the champs can win it This year that would be Miami Oregon Colorado Illinois and Maryland You can use the BCS to determine the top This would obviously have to be modified for independent teams like Notre Dame but thats for smarter people than me If a case like the OregonColorado situation comes up where the teams are so close that a clearcut cannot be determined have them play weeks from the BCS announcement day which is around the th Pick a place half way between each school maybe Vegas for this one and the BCS can pick up the bill for both teams their staffs and bands The revenue made from it being the only televised college game that day would more than make up for the costs The winner goes to the title game and the loser goes to a predetermined bowl The week interval would give the kids time to take their finals go to award ceremonies like the Heisman and still have a solid week of practice in there for the game It would not affect the preparation for the bowl game since most teams dont start that until around Christmas The only down side I see is its a long NFLlike year for the kids Trust me when I say it would have bothered no one in Eugene or Boulder if there was a game last weekend to see who would draw Miami The Holiday Bowl in San Diego Washington pm Austin Time ESPN Texas goes back to Cali to exorcise some west coast demons The horns went there in with a bad effort against Stanford and a nail biter v Oregon Texas is a heavy favorite in this game for good reason at least on paper The Longhorns finished the season ranked in defense allowing only ypg The Huskies are a passing team and are th nationally with ypg Texas is th v the pass allowing only ypg They say to beat a team make them onedimensional Washington already is onedimensional They are th nationally in rushing at ypg which plays right into the hands of the th ranked Texas rush defense which yields only ypg If Ivan Williams played for the Huskies he would be their nd leading rusher trailing the leader by yards and he hasnt seen the field since day light savings The Texas defense has to be licking their chops for a redemption game after the Big XII Championship and this one could be just what the doctor ordered at least on paper The matchup of the day will be Quentin Jammer vs Reggie Williams You all know Jams story but if you havent heard of Reggie Williams pay attention The lb freshman is Udubs Real Deal He had yards on catches and was the PACs Freshman of the Year If he gets loose in the secondary look out The other side of field will be just as intriguing with Rod Babers locked up with burner Paul Arnold who is their main deep threat Babers is a great cover corner but will have to bring his Agame to keep up with Arnold The main problem for Washington this year has been their oline They have given up sacks this season and are only in rd down conversions If the Texas front can bring heat on qb Cody Pickett the Husky offense could be in trouble Major Applewhite starts his final college game The offense will not change in scheme since neither Texas qb likes to run Look for some shotgun though since Major likes it and Chris doesnt If Benson goes check in the news and notes section for more on Ced Texas will look to exploit the weakness of the Huskies their run defense Washington gives up ypg on the ground which is exactly what Texas averages They allow per carry and a whopping touchdowns on the ground Senior dt Larry Tripplett is in the Casey Hampton mold and the AllAmerican is a great run stopper but the linebacking corps is hasnt played consistent enough to help on run defense The secondary is young and inexperienced They have had their moments but as a whole good teams can beat them If the Texas oline can spark up the running game Applewhite will pick them apart with his vision Look for Washington to bring the house at Major and if the oline repels the borders Husky fans will be leaving VERY early CORRECTION I gave you the wrong address for Moose McGillycuddys Apparently there are and I picked the wrong one Here it is Moose McGillycuddys

violating team rules Attacking police officers is never a good idea my man I hope he gets himself straightened out hes a player Meanwhile back up qb Taylor Barton and walkons were arrested on the University of the Pacific campus for trespassing after refusing to leave the grounds Im sure they had their reasons So now Washington is left with options at nd team qb Casey Paus who is redshirting this season and would lose it for even play or Adam Seery a converted linebacker who hasnt thrown a pass or lettered in his years at Udub Now this is a qb controversy With the way their oline plays

I do mean EVERYBODY I think that even I had a few carries and my wife had a sack Good to see Major get one more score and then launch the ball rows into the student section There is no football game this weekend but there is plenty going on with the Longhorns The basketball season opens the TJ Ford Era on Saturday as the horns face giant killer Arizona who already has beaten Maryland and Florida all with replacing NBAbound starters If you are around Austin Saturday get yourself to the basketball game Lets make it as hard to play in the Drum as it is in DKR There is that little matter of OU going out to Lubbock to play Tech on Saturday as well Get your guns up Longhorns What can I say about this COMPLETE DOMINATION Utterly complete The horns rolled up yards total offense all three quarterbacks accounted for touchdowns every single player who is not redshirting played The Defense seems to be getting nastier each week The Jayhawks had yards of total offense yards The closest they got to the endzone was the Texas Special teams standout Michael Ungar outscored Kansas all by himself with a safety of the Jayhawk punter who bobbled the snap in the endzone Ungar beat Kansas Texas also had another safety when Marcus Tubbs sacked quarterback Mario Kinsey in the endzone so I guess Tubbs beat Kansas too If Texas wanted to score on Saturday they would have made it so The Jayhawks in my opinion quit on their interim coach Saturday They came out flat played flat and were immediately flattened by a fired up Texas team ready to honor their seniors by getting all of them in the game The only down side to this game was the kickoff coverage Kansas seemed to get through the initial wall and get the ball close to midfield almost every time I think this was due to two things The kickoff coverage team was looking for the knockout blow that would make SportsCenter They were all exhausted from covering kicks in the game I think this problem was unique to the blowout and will correct itself by the Aggie game If thats my worst complaint then I guess its a good day The BCS OU vs Tech Bowl Theories Lets talk about the BCS for a minute Ive heard from some of you that you dont like the BCS I concur I dont see how they can tell a team it must play in a major conference to be eligible BYU will be snubbed due to this and then amend the rules to filter it fairly See only teams from one conference can play in the BCS The BCS was installed to eliminate the bias of voters and make sure the best teams make it to the top bowls With that being said how can the NCAA use this system and then turn around and say Oh Im sorry but we can only have teams from one conference teams would allow too much money to go to one conference and thats not fair Excuse me Why does it have to be fair here Is it fair that Notre Dame has its own TV deal with NBC while better teams never get seen They make A LOT of money that other schools dont Is it fair that one BCSfactoring poll in Seattle has a Pac team at and an Atlantabased poll has an SEC team Oregon and Florida have both jumped Texas in the BCS this week Maybe the Dallas Morning News should start a BCS poll to even the score with its own polling methods Its not fair anywhere in college football its not supposed to be The Big shouldnt be guaranteed a team in the BCS if they cant produce in the top penalizing another that has No conference should College football is eliminate the weak and the strong survive so why be fair in deciding a national champion It is a shame that Texas Oklahoma or Nebraska will get left out so it will be fair I will get off of my soapbox Like I stated earlier get your guns up people I am officially jumping on the Texas Tech bandwagon now One way please and Id like a window seat maybe in the emergency exit row Theres plenty of room for everybody The Sooners are point favorites in Lubbock this weekend but it should be fun to watch Kliff with a K throwing it all over the place We really NEED this game If Tech can pull this off Texas plays the Aggies for the right to go to Dallas If Tech loses then Texas has to hope Nebraska beats OU in the Big XII Championship Game and the horns get the BCS nod over the loss Sooners which could happen Prepare yourself for this Texas will not make the BCS If OU wins out and beats Nebraska in Dallas those will certainly make it to the BCS In that case Texas will end up in Dallas in the Cotton Bowl vs an SEC team Ole Miss or Auburn I know this isnt the place most of us want to go but it might be where we do go Now Dallas isnt exactly the endofseason goal that Texas had in mind but they will shake it off and play where they are sent Many of you and I do mean many have proposed theories and explanations to me as to why the horns would end up BCSless the soft schedule starting the wrong quarterback the wrong tailback not throwing deep not running up the middle and on and on Some of these are solid valid reasons that I cannot argue with and some are not Whatever the case no one can change what has might happened but we can all affect the future The Cotton Bowl is a major bowl on New Years Day national telecast against a quality team I for one would love to rinse that Arkansas taste out of my mouth It will be hard for me to complain about an season and a final ranking after a big win over Ole Miss in Dallas I think most of you like me think of the sour ending to the season and associate that with the Cotton Bowl Dont It isnt and we will not be there because we limped to the finish like then we will be there as arguably the best team in the country and winners of straight no offense Ags who were snubbed due to a technicality Dallas is close Dallas is fun Again I will get off of my soapbox Here are the directions to the tailgate again for Texas AM It will be located in lot near Reed Arena the basketball stadium and the Varsity Tennis Center There is a map below When clicking on the map lot is located on John

got their st no hitter since last season when Texas shut out Houston The yards allowed was the fewest since They also held their th straight opponent to under yards total offense The Longhorns have now won in a row at home The average score in those games is and Texas has scored over points in the last at DKR The Texas offense racked up yards on the Jayhawks It was the high mark for the season and the most yards the horns have produced since the yard output last year against Kansas Ouch Cedric Benson continues to excel Ced had yards rushing on carries and touchdowns and td and yards receiving on receptions Ceds broke the alltime game freshman rushing record for Texas Charles Hunter and his allpurpose yards are th on the alltime list and st for freshmen Can you say Big XII Offensive Freshman of the Year Chris Simms threw touchdown passes on Saturday breaking Major Applewhites school record of for a season Simms now has this season with game to go Roy Williams is good Roy W moved into nd place on the alltime touchdown receptions list The yarder marked his th career touchdown reception behind the leader Mike Adams This guy is a sophomore Yikes Place kicker Dusty Mangum had points xp fg to give him points for the day Mangum now has for the season making him the alltime leading scorer for a freshman Phil Dawson Wide out BJ Johnson extended his streak of games with a reception to which is a record to start a career He is behind the alltime leader of consecutive games with a catch Mike Adams Around the Conference Nice offense Ags The AM Aggies couldnt hold onto a point st quarter lead in Norman and were eventually blown out by OU The Aggie defense scored the only touchdown for AM as the farmer offense continues to struggle Once again the AM offense managed more points than I scored this weekend No more complaining about trick plays Coach Bob Coach Bob and some players blew up after they lost to Nebraska on the reverse pass for a touchdown to Crouch Trick Plays they whined No more The Sooners broke the game open with a fake field goal when pk Tim Duncan caught a pitch and stumbled into the endzone You hate losing on trick plays huh Glass houses big rocks everybody duck Kliff Kingsbury went off in Stillwater Kliff with a K threw for yards and scores as the Red Raiders won their rd straight beating OSU This week Coach Bob visits the

Stillwater was fun We had several hundred people at the tailgate and by the middle of the rd quarter I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma Aggies All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is Im glad we do not return for years Brutal Absolutely brutal Texas looked a little sloppy early but righted the ship to cruise on course Oklahoma State had a solid game plan but the Texas adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys The running game reappeared this week and freshman studtobe Cedric Benson got his st career start He did not disappoint El Ced finished the day with yards on carries His solid running opened up the passing lanes for Simms and Co who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary to the tune of touchdown passes All in all the muchanticipated OU hangover did not come to pass Texas took care of the weaker opponent as they should have Colorado pm ABC telecast ESPN Gameday the radio edition not the tv show will be here for the game Texas comes in ranked and CU comes in ranked This is a game both teams need to validate their seasons Texas needs to show the world and themselves that they can indeed win a big game A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a probable win season no offense Aggies while a loss could send this team into a tailspin Colorado much like Texas is a different team at home They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder but now must show they have grown up and can win on the road This is a HUGE game If the horns hold serve they should sail into College Station with a BCS birth on the line This will not be easy Texas has not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does The Buffs are in the Big XII in the nation in rushing offense ypg National tv coverage temperature in the high s top teams getting after it I wouldnt want it any other way There will be no television for the Missouri game The Texas Athletic Department has asked the Missouri AD to allow a payperview

polls I said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business things would shake out for them Its sort of setting up that way isnt it weeks ago Texas was with unbeatens in front of them In the last days half of those teams have lost Of the now in front play each other in the next weeks and the other have VERY tricky games Florida vs Georgia UCLA vs Oregon The horns are right there in it Hello shovel pass Texas won a big game Okay not THE big game but A big game nonetheless The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping their chests about their rushing game and physical defense and left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact Texas forced turnovers tying a season high OSU shutting down the Buffalo ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of yards total offense On to the shovel pass Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass because they only did it a few times in the Spring If you did see them try it in the Spring your heart was in your throat like mine when they ran it on their own because it was never what you would call a good play in practice I think they tried it times and totaled something like minus yards and one interception Nonetheless Simms sucked them in Ced got the corner and Roy sprung him to midfield Two plays later One being a fade to Roy that was maybe Simms best throw this year touchdown That was absolutely a soulstealing drive If there is a team in college football better at putting someone away right before the half than Texas I havent seen them Missouri pm No TV Well the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for you The reason the payperview didnt work is the way it was set up Texas residents would pay to see it but it would be regionally televised in Missouri That sounds fair right Okay now no one gets to see it Oh well listen to the Texas game and watch OU play Nebraska For those of you going to Missouri it should be fun Mizzou has played pretty well in the last weeks but its hard to get scared of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME Bowling Green Are you kidding me Anyway look for those not going listen for Texas to run run run this week Missouri cannot stop the run allowing ypg so Texas will exploit that Last year Roy Williams ran loose in the Tiger secondary and Applewhite found him repeatedly catches yds I see no reason for this to change particularly when Mizzou will have to put on the line of scrimmage to stop the run The tEXas tailgate will be at Spankys Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn in Columbia The tailgate will begin at am and run until roughly pm The bar will be
