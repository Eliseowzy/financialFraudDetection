preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between Chancellor Reed and yourself Communications and indications from the UCCSU team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with him on February As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday all things are moving along well in California with our clients PGE and SCE The current exception to the smooth sailing is UCCSU Tom Riley the account manager for UCCSU has prepared the following outline of business concerns sequence of events and suggested talking points Ken thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this client Regards Dan Business Concerns UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enrons action to DeDASR their accounts They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that would allow us to address them but I have been able to surmise that they consist of the following UCCSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access customer ABX recently signed by Gov Davis has ban language preventing large commercialindustrial customers from going Direct Access Per Jeff Dasovich of Enron Gov Affairs it is not clear but possible that if we had not DeDASRed the accounts that UCCSU might have been grandfathered as a direct access customer Further SBX still pending which is Senator Bowens attempt to reverse the ban language of ABX may have a financial ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status Dasovich is investigating further UC and CSU bought approximately meters from Enron as we implemented the contract Our action is forcing the utility to remove these Universityowned meters meaning that their meters will become useless We are currently using those meters to provide daily minute interval data as required in our contract Our operations and billing group have come up with a transition plan that SCE has agreed to SCE would install dualsockets allowing for the installation of the SCE meter while keeping our meter in tact mitigating their concern At this point UC and CSU are not listening to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this solution We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling coordinator SC As a result of our action we are no longer their SC They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program Sequence of Events February I informed the UCCSU electricity oversight board leaders and contract administrators of Enrons decision I walked through the power point presentation They expressed no concerns at that point and even expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract I sent the UC and CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our decision February Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we will honor the contract I have since heard that this call was extremely well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and Kens assurances that were communicated We offered the call to the UC President as well but were channeled to his SVP By the time I made contact with the SVPs administrator we had begun receiving letters below so I backed off on arranging the call February UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their questions February UC and CSU send letters to their PGE and SCE account managers advising them they have concerns regarding Enrons decision and that they PGE and SCE should only DeDASR on the Universities request February I received a letter from the UCCSU contract administers asking for clarifications regarding our action and requesting we reDASR their accounts February I responded with a letter providing them with responses to their clarification questions but did not offer to reDASR their accounts as they had requested February UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their request to reDASR and indicated they would be sending another letter I suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses February CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay Throughout the entire process I have been asking that the business administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns I gather CSU would like to do this however UC is more inclined to write letters and seek legal remedies Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome We were faced with a difficult business decision and made our California decision with our customers in mind We have kept our contracts in tact Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers We are an energy outsourcing company We should source supply from the best available source in the marketplace We feel we have a contractual right to have made the decision Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business administrators to listen to and address their concerns We have not been afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered However the Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to reDASR their accounts in the meantime I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired I can be reached at office or mobile if you have any questions Regards Tom

nron Susan J NRON Richard nron James D nron Paul CT Mary CT Joe NRON Mark NRON Karen NRON cc Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators Securitize uncollected power purchase costs To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our

consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from

be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their

preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between Chancellor Reed and yourself Communications and indications from the UCCSU team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with him on February As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday all things are moving along well in California with our clients PGE and SCE The current exception to the smooth sailing is UCCSU Tom Riley the account manager for UCCSU has prepared the following outline of business concerns sequence of events and suggested talking points Ken thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this client Regards Dan Business Concerns UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enrons action to DeDASR their accounts They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that would allow us to address them but I have been able to surmise that they consist of the following UCCSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access customer ABX recently signed by Gov Davis has ban language preventing large commercialindustrial customers from going Direct Access Per Jeff Dasovich of Enron Gov Affairs it is not clear but possible that if we had not DeDASRed the accounts that UCCSU might have been grandfathered as a direct access customer Further SBX still pending which is Senator Bowens attempt to reverse the ban language of ABX may have a financial ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status Dasovich is investigating further UC and CSU bought approximately meters from Enron as we implemented the contract Our action is forcing the utility to remove these Universityowned meters meaning that their meters will become useless We are currently using those meters to provide daily minute interval data as required in our contract Our operations and billing group have come up with a transition plan that SCE has agreed to SCE would install dualsockets allowing for the installation of the SCE meter while keeping our meter in tact mitigating their concern At this point UC and CSU are not listening to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this solution We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling coordinator SC As a result of our action we are no longer their SC They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program Sequence of Events February I informed the UCCSU electricity oversight board leaders and contract administrators of Enrons decision I walked through the power point presentation They expressed no concerns at that point and even expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract I sent the UC and CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our decision February Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we will honor the contract I have since heard that this call was extremely well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and Kens assurances that were communicated We offered the call to the UC President as well but were channeled to his SVP By the time I made contact with the SVPs administrator we had begun receiving letters below so I backed off on arranging the call February UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their questions February UC and CSU send letters to their PGE and SCE account managers advising them they have concerns regarding Enrons decision and that they PGE and SCE should only DeDASR on the Universities request February I received a letter from the UCCSU contract administers asking for clarifications regarding our action and requesting we reDASR their accounts February I responded with a letter providing them with responses to their clarification questions but did not offer to reDASR their accounts as they had requested February UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their request to reDASR and indicated they would be sending another letter I suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses February CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay Throughout the entire process I have been asking that the business administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns I gather CSU would like to do this however UC is more inclined to write letters and seek legal remedies Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome We were faced with a difficult business decision and made our California decision with our customers in mind We have kept our contracts in tact Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers We are an energy outsourcing company We should source supply from the best available source in the marketplace We feel we have a contractual right to have made the decision Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business administrators to listen to and address their concerns We have not been afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered However the Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to reDASR their accounts in the meantime I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired I can be reached at office or mobile if you have any questions Regards Tom

was extremely well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and Kens assurances that were communicated We offered the call to the UC President as well but were channeled to his SVP By the time I made contact with the SVPs administrator we had begun receiving letters below so I backed off on arranging the call February UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their questions February UC and CSU send letters to their PGE and SCE account managers advising them they have concerns regarding Enrons decision and that they PGE and SCE should only DeDASR on the Universities request February I received a letter from the UCCSU contract administers asking for clarifications regarding our action and requesting we reDASR their accounts February I responded with a letter providing them with responses to their clarification questions but did not offer to reDASR their accounts as they had requested February UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their request to reDASR and indicated they would be sending another letter I suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses February CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay Throughout the entire process I have been asking that the business administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns I gather CSU would like to do this however UC is more inclined to write letters and seek legal remedies Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome We were faced with a difficult business decision and made our California decision with our customers in mind We have kept our contracts in tact Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers We are an energy outsourcing company We should source supply from the best available source in the marketplace We feel we have a contractual right to have made the decision Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business administrators to listen to and address their concerns We have not been afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered However the Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to reDASR their accounts in the meantime I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired I can be reached at office or mobile if you have any questions Regards Tom

nron Susan J NRON Richard nron James D nron Paul CT Mary CT Joe NRON Mark NRON Karen NRON cc Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators Securitize uncollected power purchase costs To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between Chancellor Reed and yourself Communications and indications from the UCCSU team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with him on February As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday all things are moving along well in California with our clients PGE and SCE The current exception to the smooth sailing is UCCSU Tom Riley the account manager for UCCSU has prepared the following outline of business concerns sequence of events and suggested talking points Ken thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this client Regards Dan Business Concerns UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enrons action to DeDASR their accounts They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that would allow us to address them but I have been able to surmise that they consist of the following UCCSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access customer ABX recently signed by Gov Davis has ban language preventing large commercialindustrial customers from going Direct Access Per Jeff Dasovich of Enron Gov Affairs it is not clear but possible that if we had not DeDASRed the accounts that UCCSU might have been grandfathered as a direct access customer Further SBX still pending which is Senator Bowens attempt to reverse the ban language of ABX may have a financial ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status Dasovich is investigating further UC and CSU bought approximately meters from Enron as we implemented the contract Our action is forcing the utility to remove these Universityowned meters meaning that their meters will become useless We are currently using those meters to provide daily minute interval data as required in our contract Our operations and billing group have come up with a transition plan that SCE has agreed to SCE would install dualsockets allowing for the installation of the SCE meter while keeping our meter in tact mitigating their concern At this point UC and CSU are not listening to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this solution We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling coordinator SC As a result of our action we are no longer their SC They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program Sequence of Events February I informed the UCCSU electricity oversight board leaders and contract administrators of

ES Tanya ES Tasha ES Ted CT Terri NRON Tony ES Vicki ES Vladimir CT Wanda ES William S CT Subject UpdateDay of California PUC Hearings Thanks Roger Here are the highlights of todays hearings Common themesmany tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise but by how much Though some oppose any and all rate increases the lions share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary Due process matters If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates it better provide for ample due process or countless law suits will ensue Dont jump the gun A rate increase is likely but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities proposals The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets However as expected the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan No more divestiture The utility should keep the generating assets it retained but the Commission should ensure that the assets benefits are allocated equally among all customers One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities hydro assets which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation Treat all customers equally and fairly The Commission should not create two classes of customers eg large v small direct access v bundled No customer group should be sacrificied to save another Be as narrow as possibledo as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utilitys cashcredit crunch As such the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific immediate problem A modest rate increase is all thats required and the Commission should do no more At the beginning and the end of the hearing the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared at tomorrows hearing to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates but leaving AB otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced the theme came up repeatedly A few parties eg the Unions low income consumer groups one PUC commissioner called for complete reregulation of the industry returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies But they were the exception rather than the rule at todays hearing Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay but now will continue through Friday Tomorrow lawyers will provide oral arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates We will argue that it does not have to and should not go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze and if it decides to raise rates it should do so while keeping AB s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach In terms of legal arguments this is clearly a long shot but one that seems worth taking After the oral argument the utilities will present their rate proposals and all interested persons will have the opportunity to crossexamine the utilities in short tomorrow will also be a zoo When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments the President of the Commission responded we dont know its evolving In other words the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan decision is appealproof Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan th We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side Were doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights We can discuss further on the AM CST call tomorrow Best Jeff Roger ES PM To Leticia ES cc Ted CT Dennis ES James W ES Scott ES Don ES

nron Susan J NRON Richard nron James D nron Paul CT Mary CT Joe NRON Mark NRON Karen NRON cc Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators Securitize uncollected power purchase costs To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

preparatory notes for a potential phone call today between Chancellor Reed and yourself Communications and indications from the UCCSU team are that he may call you today as a follow up to your discussion with him on February As I mentioned at the Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday all things are moving along well in California with our clients PGE and SCE The current exception to the smooth sailing is UCCSU Tom Riley the account manager for UCCSU has prepared the following outline of business concerns sequence of events and suggested talking points Ken thank you for your assistance and continued participation with this client Regards Dan Business Concerns UC and CSU have business concerns regarding Enrons action to DeDASR their accounts They have not communicated their concerns with enough detail that would allow us to address them but I have been able to surmise that they consist of the following UCCSU is now a bundled access customer instead of a direct access customer ABX recently signed by Gov Davis has ban language preventing large commercialindustrial customers from going Direct Access Per Jeff Dasovich of Enron Gov Affairs it is not clear but possible that if we had not DeDASRed the accounts that UCCSU might have been grandfathered as a direct access customer Further SBX still pending which is Senator Bowens attempt to reverse the ban language of ABX may have a financial ramification for customers switching to and from Direct Access status Dasovich is investigating further UC and CSU bought approximately meters from Enron as we implemented the contract Our action is forcing the utility to remove these Universityowned meters meaning that their meters will become useless We are currently using those meters to provide daily minute interval data as required in our contract Our operations and billing group have come up with a transition plan that SCE has agreed to SCE would install dualsockets allowing for the installation of the SCE meter while keeping our meter in tact mitigating their concern At this point UC and CSU are not listening to our business solutions so we have not received feedback from them on this solution We have a contractual obligation to be the Universities scheduling coordinator SC As a result of our action we are no longer their SC They are concerned this may inhibit our ability to act as their SC for their recent proposal to the ISO under the Demand Reduction Program Sequence of Events February I informed the UCCSU electricity oversight board leaders and contract administrators of Enrons decision I walked through the power point presentation They expressed no concerns at that point and even expressed appreciation we were standing by our contract I sent the UC and CSU contract administrators the letter later that day advising them of our decision February Ken Lay called Chancellor Reed assuring the Chancellor that we will honor the contract I have since heard that this call was extremely well received and that the CSU campus VPs have been advised of the call and Kens assurances that were communicated We offered the call to the UC President as well but were channeled to his SVP By the time I made contact with the SVPs administrator we had begun receiving letters below so I backed off on arranging the call February UC and CSU contract administrators inform us they have been speaking to their regulatory advisor and asked for some clarifications Maureen Palmer and I speak to the contract administrators and answer their questions February UC and CSU send letters to their PGE and SCE account managers advising them they have concerns regarding Enrons decision and that they PGE and SCE should only DeDASR on the Universities request February I received a letter from the UCCSU contract administers asking for clarifications regarding our action and requesting we reDASR their accounts February I responded with a letter providing them with responses to their clarification questions but did not offer to reDASR their accounts as they had requested February UC informed me they were unhappy we did not comply with their request to reDASR and indicated they would be sending another letter I suspect this letter will express potential legal recourses February CSU and UC informed they would hold off on the letter pending outcome of a call between Chancellor Reed and Ken Lay Throughout the entire process I have been asking that the business administrators meet with us so Enron can hear their concerns I gather CSU would like to do this however UC is more inclined to write letters and seek legal remedies Suggested Talking Points for Call and Desired Outcome We were faced with a difficult business decision and made our California decision with our customers in mind We have kept our contracts in tact Other energy service providers have left the market and their customers We are an energy outsourcing company We should source supply from the best available source in the marketplace We feel we have a contractual right to have made the decision Desired outcome is that we want to sit down with the University business administrators to listen to and address their concerns We have not been afforded this opportunity to date though we have offered However the Chancellor needs to understand we are not willing to reDASR their accounts in the meantime I will be available for the debrief with Ken if desired I can be reached at office or mobile if you have any questions Regards Tom

nron Susan J NRON Richard nron James D nron Paul CT Mary CT Joe NRON Mark NRON Karen NRON cc Subject Meeting with Governor Davis need for additional commentssuggestions We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA In attendance were Ken Lay the Governor the Governors staff director Kari Dohn and myself The gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors comments Overview We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees His staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers including utilityowned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a costplus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at MW He foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover Our proposals I have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided He seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x MW of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas purchases As already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities His ideas The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming Some of these ideas would require legislative action State may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases This was a frequently recurring theme Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a costplus basis to consumers Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in California State universities including UCCSU and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation Expand instate gas production Take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies Empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how Nordpool worksJeff someone in Schroeders group should be able to help out here Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state We made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new instate generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators Securitize uncollected power purchase costs To dos Jeff again Id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to Kari He wants to see year fixed power prices for peak offpeak and baseload not just the one year strips He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues Thanks to everyone for their help We made some progress today

ES Tanya ES Tasha ES Ted CT Terri NRON Tony ES Vicki ES Vladimir CT Wanda ES William S CT Subject UpdateDay of California PUC Hearings Thanks Roger Here are the highlights of todays hearings Common themesmany tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise but by how much Though some oppose any and all rate increases the lions share acknowledged that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is necessary Due process matters If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and increasing rates it better provide for ample due process or countless law suits will ensue Dont jump the gun A rate increase is likely but only the utilities benefit from adoption of the utilities proposals The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the utilities claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required to maintain access to capital markets However as expected the utilities implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately The utilities want the Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan No more divestiture The utility should keep the generating assets it retained but the Commission should ensure that the assets benefits are allocated equally among all customers One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities hydro assets which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the state control over some generation Treat all customers equally and fairly The Commission should not create two classes of customers eg large v small direct access v bundled No customer group should be sacrificied to save another Be as narrow as possibledo as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utilitys cashcredit crunch As such the Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific immediate problem A modest rate increase is all thats required and the Commission should do no more At the beginning and the end of the hearing the President of the Commission asked parties to be prepared at tomorrows hearing to discuss whether the Commission could legally use its other broad powers to raise rates without declaring an end to the rate freeze It seems that she seems some benefit in raising rates but leaving AB otherwise intact untill the Commission can Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced the theme came up repeatedly A few parties eg the Unions low income consumer groups one PUC commissioner called for complete reregulation of the industry returning the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies But they were the exception rather than the rule at todays hearing Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay but now will continue through Friday Tomorrow lawyers will provide oral arguments on whether the Commission must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates We will argue that it does not have to and should not go through the complex and controversial exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates without ending the rate freeze and if it decides to raise rates it should do so while keeping AB s basic structure in place until a full and fair hearing of the issues is completed We are talking to other stakeholders to persuade them to take the same approach In terms of legal arguments this is clearly a long shot but one that seems worth taking After the oral argument the utilities will present their rate proposals and all interested persons will have the opportunity to crossexamine the utilities in short tomorrow will also be a zoo When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and providing comments the President of the Commission responded we dont know its evolving In other words the Commission is doing a poor job of ensuring that their Jan decision is appealproof Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan th We continue to aggressively offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other stakeholders to our side Were doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights We can discuss further on the AM CST call tomorrow Best Jeff Roger ES PM To Leticia ES cc Ted CT Dennis ES James W ES Scott ES Don ES

news Comments have been all over the place The impression is being made by differing parties that the issues are very complex and would inevitably result in endless lawsuits Possible conclusion by the CPUC may be to invoke emergency powers to implement an emergency surcharge and avoid addressing the issue of when the rate freeze ends in these hearings However this is just speculation Jeff will
