the upcoming Operations Update MMC is committed to assisting the families of our colleagues through this most difficult time We want to make sure that they are aware of all the programs and services the Company is providing and that they fully understand the benefits to which they are entitled as well as other benefits that may be available through outside agencies In reviewing the most effective way to continue serving the families affected by the September th disaster we have made the decision to move to a family relationship management approach Our priority in moving forward is to ensure that we provide the families with the best oneonone assistance and the best information possible Family Relationship Management To that end we have engaged Right Management Associates Right to work with us as our Family Relationship Managers Reginald McQuay a Marsh Senior Vice President will manage this program as the main interface between Marsh and Rights counselors to guide this important process All of the Family Relationship Managers have substantial experience in Human Resources and we feel they will represent us well as we help the families move forward Additionally Right has worked with Marsh over the last several years and therefore knows our organization well We are already moving quickly to transition to this process The Family Relationship Managers have participated in detailed orientation and training sessions acquainting themselves with MMCs benefits legal communication and policy issues Each of the families will be contacted within the next week by the Family Relationship Managers representing Marsh in this way the transition will be as transparent as possible to the families In addition a letter will be sent to each familys primary contact this week providing them with the name and phone number of their Relationship Manager One important point that you need to be aware of concerns the primary contact for each family We have been working with the MMC Benefits and Legal Departments to determine whom the appropriate family contact for all matters should be as we move forward Please keep in mind that this individual may not always be the person with whom you have had contact We are trying to ensure that the detailed financial and benefit information is only provided to the family members who should have it Additional Counseling We will also be offering Survivor Support Financial Counseling to the primary contact through the Ayco Company Ayco counselors will provide detailed information on survivor benefits and will also be arranging to meet personally with each of the families This will follow issuance of the benefit summary statement which is scheduled to be distributed during the week of October Ayco counselors will be coordinating their efforts with the Family Relationship Managers as well In addition we have expanded the Employee Assistance Program EAP for one year for the families This will provide access to counselors who are skilled in grief and trauma situations Your Role As A Manager We recognize that in many instances Marsh managers have had long relationships with the various families Although it is important to maintain those contacts and continue to provide emotional support it is equally important that you begin to transfer the responsibility for information dissemination and management to the Family Relationship Managers To this end we are asking that you allow the Family Relationship Managers to facilitate the contact with all Marsh services and that you do not provide direct referrals to services promise any additional services or become the intermediary in resolving the families issues Please keep us informed of your contact with any of the families since this information can be helpful to Family Relationship Managers To help facilitate this we have attached a call log to capture important information from both past conversations and any particulars that may arise in the future Please forward these logs to Reg McQuay at Ave of the Americas rd floor This Family Relationship Management Program will provide the best possible support for our colleagues families as they move forward during this difficult time If you have any further questions please call me or your HR manager and help us by distributing this memo to other managers who need to know this information
