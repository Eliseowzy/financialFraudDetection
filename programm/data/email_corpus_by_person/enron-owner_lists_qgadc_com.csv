THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Despite proclamations by Gov Gray Davis that California finally has gotten the upper hand over its electricity crisis there are new signs that the state is struggling in its role as an enormous power buyer For the first five months of this year the state Department of Water Resources in charge of purchasing electricity on behalf of two big financially ailing California utilities bought too little power to meet the states needs and as a result risks triggering billion in federal fines Then for the past few weeks the DWR as the agency is known has been buying too much electricity potentially saddling rate payers with the cost of juice they wont ever actually use Finally a slew of longterm contracts the state signed with suppliers intended to calm a volatile spot power market that sent prices to record levels in recent months may actually end up being too expensive As new power plants crank up here over the next two years Californians appear to be locked into paying rates for as many as years far in excess of what market prices are likely to be State officials defend their powermanagement work saying the negotiation of the longterm contracts and the daily powerpurchasing record of the DWR have helped bring down electricity prices from punishing levels in recent weeks and have reduced the threat of blackouts S David Freeman the governors energy adviser likens the states job performance to a plane that landed safely after undergoing harsh turbulence If so it is a pretty bumpy approach Take the case of purchasing too little power Back in December the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed financial penalties designed to compel California utilities to lock in more power on the forward market and to reduce their dependence on lastminute purchases that jeopardized electricsystem reliability But in the day period between the time the penalties were ordered and June the DWR was judged by regulators to have purchased too little power of the time That in turn triggered penalties of for each megawatt hour of power purchased by the California Independent System Operator above certain thresholds in its real time energy market State officials notified FERC late Friday that the penalties had become astronomical and asked that they be eliminated In its meeting Monday FERC is expected to roll out broader price controls for the Western power market But it isnt expected to address the penalty issue Now the state faces a new problem of at times purchasing too much power partly due to the activation of longterm power contracts signed by the state since January On Friday Gov Davis released heavily censored copies of these documents after a judge compelled him to do so as a result of lawsuits brought by Republican state legislators and a consortium of news organizations including The Wall Street Journal The plaintiffs will go back to court June to request complete disclosure of the contract terms In news conferences Friday and Sunday state officials depicted the contracts as a victory for the state which has been grappling with a huge supplyanddemand imbalance in its electricity market since last summer We had a mighty tussle to negotiate these contracts said Mr Freeman adding that they provide energy at prices anyone would consider just and reasonable Some industry executives believe the contracts tell a different story Jack Adrian a powerindustry executive who has been building power plants for years said his analysis leads him to believe theres nothing to boast about here The suppliers are getting the best of a desperate customer Mr Adrian chief executive of Californiabased Delma Power Co and a former executive at Edison International parent of one of Californias ailing utilities said it is impossible in some instances to determine what prices the state has committed to pay because key pieces of information have been deleted But he said where numbers are available it is clear that prices are way too high several orders of magnitude higher than anything ever permitted the utilities Many of the contracts contain take or pay provisions that commit the state to pay for power for five to years whether or not it is needed That may help to explain why in June a new problem has cropped up overscheduling where the state at times has ordered too much power to be delivered To keep from overloading electric lines the ISO has had to order some generating units to produce less juice In the first days of June there were excesssupply problems on nine days It is unclear if the state was able to resell any of that excess power and if so at what prices State officials declined to comment An examination of the longterm contracts shows about half contain fixed power prices The rest have prices that fluctuate depending on fuel costs and other factors Mr Freeman said the state has negotiated prices that average a megawatt hour for the next years For now though according to the states own statistics it appears California is paying substantially more than that In five of the past six months spotmarket prices have been lower than the average price paid by the DWR Mr Freeman said forward contracting by the state is the reason spot prices have fallen Regardless it puts the state in an awkward position Before FERC it is arguing that spot power prices are neither just nor reasonable and must be restrained It also wants multibilliondollar refunds from wholesale power suppliers Yet within California state officials are making the case that the prices in the contracts it has signed are fair even though they are in many cases higher than spot prices Analysts say it isnt clear how the state intends to resolve this apparent contradiction In effect they note California is seeking refunds from generators on the lower spotmarket prices they charged while trumpeting contract prices which are in many cases higher Write to Rebecca Smith at

Deregulation of Utilities California Gives Itself Lead Role By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R EMSHWILLER Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SACRAMENTO Calif In a video made for a political roast Gov Gray Davis mimicking the Mafia boss in The Sopranos complains to his therapist about Texas bad guys pushing electricity prices sky high He vows to get tough Soon a Davis confederate ushers four men in gallon hats into an office shots ring out and the aide emerging bloodspattered delivers the punchline Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved While Gov Davis hasnt gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as Houstonbased Reliant Energy Inc he is in other ways trying to blast his way out of the crisis His moves are coming in rapid succession after months of criticism of the governor for inaction and they are fast reshaping the states electricity system With the acquiescence of other state leaders Gov Davis has put California on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth stateowned electric utility answerable largely to the governor Moreover though designed to solve a shortterm emergency the governors policies are loading consumers with obligations that could affect the economy of the mostpopulous state for to years His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that preceded the disastrous foray into utility deregulation But they arent simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated by the states Public Utilities Commission What is emerging now is a California power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach of regulators or the public Mr Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supply of reasonably priced electricity This is not a power grab the Democratic governor says in an interview I had no desire to intervene I would get out tomorrow if you would let me out This is my leastfavorite thing to do Colossal Failure Yet in the past six months pushed by what he calls the colossal failure of a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor the governor has put the state deep into the power business In January Mr Davis ordered the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power in place of Californias cashstrapped utilities Since then the state has purchased or committed to purchase billion to billion of electricity with some contracts as long as years The governor has in effect seized control of the states electricitygrid operator the California Independent System Operator installing his handpicked team as board members As its name implies the ISO was supposed to manage the grid without favoring any one participant Mr Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority whose director will be appointed by the governor This agency which so far exists just on paper could be used to build power plants and help run a stateowned transmission system Mr Davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a hybrid system where public power plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business Reviving the Utilities Having healthy utilities is extremely important says the governor He adds that he has been working hard to revive the states two biggest utilities the Pacific Gas Electric Co unit of PGE Corp and the Southern California Edison Co subsidiary of Edison International But as the states role in the electricity business has grown the utilities dont seem as essential as they once did This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package for Edison through the state legislature The plan among other things calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission system for billion and envisions the utility eventually resuming some powerbuying chores Talks over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility filed for bankruptcylaw protection With the state locking up so much of Californias future power needs legislators openly wonder whether utilityrescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require In for instance longterm contracts will cover of the states projected buying needs What does it mean for Edison to take over the role of buying power if the state already has signed all these contracts asks State Sen Debra Bowen a Democrat who heads the senates energy committee Nonetheless the governor says he is cautiously optimistic the legislature soon will approve an Edison rescue package Mr Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricity mess this year after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis The states utilityderegulation law which was enacted in worked fairly well until May of last year Under the deregulation plan the states investorowned utilities sold off many of their power plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a statesponsored auction Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp rise in wholesale power costs With retail rates frozen Pacific Gas and Edison racked up multibilliondollar deficits In January Mr Davis declared an emergency and put the state into the powerbuying business Since then he hasnt been bashful about exercising his emergency powers When Mr Davis couldnt get legislative permission to borrow money shortterm for power purchases he signed an executive order authorizing the state to borrow up to billion from commercial lenders That borrowing is supposed to be repaid from a roughly billion municipalbond issue the biggest in US history scheduled for later this year In another executive order the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peakdemand periods And the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders Despite such actions some think Mr Davis isnt being forceful enough For example the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the governors power to commandeer power plants if he deems such a step to be necessary Mr Davis has said he doesnt have any plans currently to take such an action Crisis of Governance The electricity mess has produced the most extraordinary crisis of governance weve had in California in the postwar period says Bruce Cain director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley Mr Cain says more power has been placed in the governors hands and as a result the state has gotten away from the separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American government Mr Davis says his actions have been essential and are working He credits the longterm power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for electricity where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply In June the state paid an average price of a megawatt hour for electricity That was down from in May though still far above the to range of two years ago But some worry about how this rush to address a shortterm problem will affect the longerterm future An economic forecast issued late last month warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the electricity business could produce enough of a drag on the California economy to reduce state output by a total of billion by and lead to higher unemployment California is at a crossroads between what amounts to a state takeover of the electricity industry and a more marketoriented approach to fixing the problem says the joint study by the Anderson business school at the University of California Los Angeles and Cambridge Energy Research Associates Under a law enacted in February none of the tens of billions of dollars of state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent by the Public Utilities Commission Thats an immunity that regulated utilities in the old regime could only dream of Then if they spent too much the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit Under the new system any purchasing missteps the state makes will be borne by consumers It scares the hell out of me says Henry Duque a Republican PUC member appointed by former Gov Pete Wilson The state is so busy looking after its own interests Whos looking out for the ratepayer PUC President Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee acknowledges that the commissions authority has been seriously eroded Under the new law the commission is supposed to charge consumers for whatever sum the Water Resources Department spends on energy She hopes to hold hearings to review the spending even if we cant do much about the result Gov Davis says concern about less oversight of power purchases is a bogus issue It is not as if a private company or utility was making the decisions The PUC doesnt need to secondguess the decisions of a public body he says But other state moves suggest theres a role for oversight The state is only now doing a conflictofinterest inquiry after several of its new energy hires filled out disclosure forms that showed they held stock in big power suppliers to the state The governors press secretary Steve Maviglio says he doesnt know whether they were asked about their holdings before being hired He says the state will take appropriate action where conflicts of interest are found The rush to beef up an outgunned state energy team may have contributed to the hiring problem Early on we had two or three people sitting around and dealing with big and savvy electricity suppliers says Mr Davis almost like a teeball team playing the New York Yankees The state has since hastily assembled a group of about energy traders headed by a yearold manager with one year of experience in the

Deregulation of Utilities California Gives Itself Lead Role By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R EMSHWILLER Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SACRAMENTO Calif In a video made for a political roast Gov Gray Davis mimicking the Mafia boss in The Sopranos complains to his therapist about Texas bad guys pushing electricity prices sky high He vows to get tough Soon a Davis confederate ushers four men in gallon hats into an office shots ring out and the aide emerging bloodspattered delivers the punchline Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved While Gov Davis hasnt gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as Houstonbased Reliant Energy Inc he is in other ways trying to blast his way out of the crisis His moves are coming in rapid succession after months of criticism of the governor for inaction and they are fast reshaping the states electricity system With the acquiescence of other state leaders Gov Davis has put California on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth stateowned electric utility answerable largely to the governor Moreover though designed to solve a shortterm emergency the governors policies are loading consumers with obligations that could affect the economy of the mostpopulous state for to years His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that preceded the disastrous foray into utility deregulation But they arent simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated by the states Public Utilities Commission What is emerging now is a California power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach of regulators or the public Mr Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supply of reasonably priced electricity This is not a power grab the Democratic governor says in an interview I had no desire to intervene I would get out tomorrow if you would let me out This is my leastfavorite thing to do Colossal Failure Yet in the past six months pushed by what he calls the colossal failure of a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor the governor has put the state deep into the power business In January Mr Davis ordered the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power in place of Californias cashstrapped utilities Since then the state has purchased or committed to purchase billion to billion of electricity with some contracts as long as years The governor has in effect seized control of the states electricitygrid operator the California Independent System Operator installing his handpicked team as board members As its name implies the ISO was supposed to manage the grid without favoring any one participant Mr Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority whose director will be appointed by the governor This agency which so far exists just on paper could be used to build power plants and help run a stateowned transmission system Mr Davis says that the authority is part of what he sees as a hybrid system where public power plays an important role augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business Reviving the Utilities Having healthy utilities is extremely important says the governor He adds that he has been working hard to revive the states two biggest utilities the Pacific Gas Electric Co unit of PGE Corp and the Southern California Edison Co subsidiary of Edison International But as the states role in the electricity business has grown the utilities dont seem as essential as they once did This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package for Edison through the state legislature The plan among other things calls for the state to buy Edisons transmission system for billion and envisions the utility eventually resuming some powerbuying chores Talks over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility filed for bankruptcylaw protection With the state locking up so much of Californias future power needs legislators openly wonder whether utilityrescue efforts are worth the billions of dollars they would require In for instance longterm contracts will cover of the states projected buying needs What does it mean for Edison to take over the role of buying power if the state already has signed all these contracts asks State Sen Debra Bowen a Democrat who heads the senates energy committee Nonetheless the governor says he is cautiously optimistic the legislature soon will approve an Edison rescue package Mr Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricity mess this year after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning crisis The states utilityderegulation law which was enacted in worked fairly well until May of last year Under the deregulation plan the states investorowned utilities sold off many of their power plants to other companies and repurchased that electricity through a statesponsored auction Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy electricity from nonutility retail suppliers But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp rise in wholesale power costs With retail rates frozen Pacific Gas and Edison racked up multibilliondollar deficits In January Mr Davis declared an emergency and put the state into the powerbuying business Since then he hasnt been bashful about exercising his emergency powers When Mr Davis couldnt get legislative permission to borrow money shortterm for power purchases he signed an executive order authorizing the state to borrow up to billion from commercial lenders That borrowing is supposed to be repaid from a roughly billion municipalbond issue the biggest in US history scheduled for later this year In another executive order the governor suspended emission standards for power plants to let them run more hours during the peakdemand periods And the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders Despite such actions some think Mr Davis isnt being forceful enough For example the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the governors power to commandeer power plants if he deems such a step to be necessary Mr Davis has said he doesnt have any plans currently to take such an action Crisis of Governance The electricity mess has produced the most extraordinary crisis of governance weve had in California in the postwar period says Bruce Cain director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley Mr Cain says more power has been placed in the governors hands and as a result the state has gotten away from the separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American government Mr Davis says his actions have been essential and are working He credits the longterm power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for electricity where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply In June the state paid an average price of a megawatt hour for electricity That was down from in May though still far above the to range of two years ago But some worry about how this rush to address a shortterm problem will affect the longerterm future An economic forecast issued late last month warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the electricity business could produce enough of a drag on the California economy to reduce state output by a total of billion by and lead to higher unemployment California is at a crossroads between what amounts to a state takeover of the electricity industry and a more marketoriented approach to fixing the problem says the joint study by the Anderson business school at the University of California Los Angeles and Cambridge Energy Research Associates Under a law enacted in February none of the tens of billions of dollars of state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent by the Public Utilities Commission Thats an immunity that regulated utilities in the old regime could only dream of Then if they spent too much the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit Under the new system any purchasing missteps the state makes will be borne by consumers It scares the hell out of me says Henry Duque a Republican PUC member appointed by former Gov Pete Wilson The state is so busy looking after its own interests Whos looking out for the ratepayer PUC President Loretta Lynch a Davis appointee acknowledges that the commissions authority has been seriously eroded Under the new law the commission is supposed to charge consumers for whatever sum the Water Resources Department spends on energy She hopes to hold hearings to review the spending even if we cant do much about the result Gov Davis says concern about less oversight of power purchases is a bogus issue It is not as if a private company or utility was making the decisions The PUC doesnt need to secondguess the decisions of a public body he says But other state moves suggest theres a role for oversight The state is only now doing a conflictofinterest inquiry after several of its new energy hires filled out disclosure forms that showed they held stock in big power suppliers to the state The governors press secretary Steve Maviglio says he doesnt know whether they were asked about their holdings before being hired He says the state will take appropriate action where conflicts of interest are found The rush to beef up an outgunned state energy team may have contributed to the hiring problem Early on we had two or three people sitting around and dealing with big and savvy electricity suppliers says Mr Davis almost like a teeball team playing the New York Yankees The state has since hastily assembled a group of about energy traders headed by a yearold manager with one year of experience in the energy business The manager Susan Lee has held four jobs in the past four years and is getting paid up to over two years for her services Ms Lee declines to comment Good Enough Even so Mr Davis argues state negotiators did well enough They managed to help lower current power costs he notes although that required signing deals that could force the state to pay a little more than it otherwise would

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Despite proclamations by Gov Gray Davis that California finally has gotten the upper hand over its electricity crisis there are new signs that the state is struggling in its role as an enormous power buyer For the first five months of this year the state Department of Water Resources in charge of purchasing electricity on behalf of two big financially ailing California utilities bought too little power to meet the states needs and as a result risks triggering billion in federal fines Then for the past few weeks the DWR as the agency is known has been buying too much electricity potentially saddling rate payers with the cost of juice they wont ever actually use Finally a slew of longterm contracts the state signed with suppliers intended to calm a volatile spot power market that sent prices to record levels in recent months may actually end up being too expensive As new power plants crank up here over the next two years Californians appear to be locked into paying rates for as many as years far in excess of what market prices are likely to be State officials defend their powermanagement work saying the negotiation of the longterm contracts and the daily powerpurchasing record of the DWR have helped bring down electricity prices from punishing levels in recent weeks and have reduced the threat of blackouts S David Freeman the governors energy adviser likens the states job performance to a plane that landed safely after undergoing harsh turbulence If so it is a pretty bumpy approach Take the case of purchasing too little power Back in December the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed financial penalties designed to compel California utilities to lock in more power on the forward market and to reduce their dependence on lastminute purchases that jeopardized electricsystem reliability But in the day period between the time the penalties were ordered and June the DWR was judged by regulators to have purchased too little power of the time That in turn triggered penalties of for each megawatt hour of power purchased by the California Independent System Operator above certain thresholds in its real time energy market State officials notified FERC late Friday that the penalties had become astronomical and asked that they be eliminated In its meeting Monday FERC is expected to roll out broader price controls for the Western power market But it isnt expected to address the penalty issue Now the state faces a new problem of at times purchasing too much power partly due to the activation of longterm power contracts signed by the state since January On Friday Gov Davis released heavily censored copies of these documents after a judge compelled him to do so as a result of lawsuits brought by Republican state legislators and a consortium of news organizations including The Wall Street Journal The plaintiffs will go back to court June to request complete disclosure of the contract terms In news conferences Friday and Sunday state officials depicted the contracts as a victory for the state which has been grappling with a huge supplyanddemand imbalance in its electricity market since last summer We had a mighty tussle to negotiate these contracts said Mr Freeman adding that they provide energy at prices anyone would consider just and reasonable Some industry executives believe the contracts tell a different story Jack Adrian a powerindustry executive who has been building power plants for years said his analysis leads him to believe theres nothing to boast about here The suppliers are getting the best of a desperate customer Mr Adrian chief executive of Californiabased Delma Power Co and a former executive at Edison International parent of one of Californias ailing utilities said it is impossible in some instances to determine what prices the state has committed to pay because key pieces of information have been deleted But he said where numbers are available it is clear that prices are way too high several orders of magnitude higher than anything ever permitted the utilities Many of the contracts contain take or pay provisions that commit the state to pay for power for five to years whether or not it is needed That may help to explain why in June a new problem has cropped up overscheduling where the state at times has ordered too much power to be delivered To keep from overloading electric lines the ISO has had to order some generating units to produce less juice In the first days of June there were excesssupply problems on nine days It is unclear if the state was able to resell any of that excess power and if so at what prices State officials declined to comment An examination of the longterm contracts shows about half contain fixed power prices The rest have prices that fluctuate depending on fuel costs and other factors Mr Freeman said the state has negotiated prices that average a megawatt hour for the next years For now though according to the states own statistics it appears California is paying substantially more than that In five of the past six months spotmarket prices have been lower than the average price paid by the DWR Mr Freeman said forward contracting by the state is the reason spot prices have fallen Regardless it puts the state in an awkward position Before FERC it is arguing that spot power prices are neither just nor reasonable and must be restrained It also wants multibilliondollar refunds from wholesale power suppliers Yet within California state officials are making the case that the prices in the contracts it has signed are fair even though they are in many cases higher than spot prices Analysts say it isnt clear how the state intends to resolve this apparent contradiction In effect they note California is seeking refunds from generators on the lower spotmarket prices they charged while trumpeting contract prices which are in many cases higher Write to Rebecca Smith at
