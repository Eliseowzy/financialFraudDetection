September PM To CcTaylor Mark E Legal Rohauer Tanya SubjectFW Revised Loss DefinitionDOC Kim I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with o ur General Counsel We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but not the other two damage concepts We do not agree to the removal of cos t of funding since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transa ction requires a premium to be paid because of the offmarket position Pr emiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component The remov al of the concept of loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating liq uidating or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position is al so a very real factor in calculating damages It may very well be that the termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing the transaction Furthermore the you can obtain the same effect of termi nating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction the equivalent o f a replacement transaction rather than an outright termination with the h edge counterparty Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of the coin so to speak it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication which I think was one of your outside counsels concerns The definition of Loss as was written is designed so that the Nondefaulting party can recover th e actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Partys failure to perform If the Defaulting Party objects to the Nondefaulting Partys calculation t hen such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and fina l determination by a New York court We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows Insert the following into Part e after the period at the end thereof The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as fo llows Loss means with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Tran sactions as the case may be and a party the Termination Currency Equival ent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a co mmercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs or gain in which case expressed as a negative number without duplication in connection wi th this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Tra nsactions as the case may be including any cost of funding or at the ele ction of such party but without duplication loss or cost incurred as a res ult of its terminating liquidating obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position or any gain resulting from any of them to be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a re placement transaction Loss does not include any loss of bargain cost of funding or loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating liquidati ng obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions Fu rthermore Loss does not include loss of bargain or a partys legal fees and outofpocket expenses referred to under Section A party will dete rmine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date or if that is no t reasonably practicable as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonab ly practicable A party may but need not determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant market If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also wil ling to use the following definition which was originally drafted by Goldm an Sachs in lieu of the Loss definition Replacement Value means with respect to each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions as the case may be and a party an amou nt that the party the Determining Party or its agent determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and c osts or gains in which case expressed as a negative number in connection with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions A D etermining Party or its agent may determine Replacement Values for all Te rminated Transactions any group of Terminated Transactions or individual T erminated Transactions and may apply different valuation methods to differ ent Transactions or groups of Transactions A Determining Party or its a gent will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as of the Early Termination Date or if that would not be commercially reason able as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates a fter the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under t hen prevailing circumstances The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definit ion of Replacement Value We hope that one of these definitions will work for you Please call if yo u have any questions or comments on the definitions Regards Brent

HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Alexandre Bueno PM To BCC cc bcc Brent HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Brazil Power Octobers Industrial Recovery and Januarys Rains CERA Alert Brazil Power Octobers Industrial Recovery and Januarys Rains CERA Alert Brazilian power demand growth strengthened in October and November rising percent and percent respectively above levels for those months see Figure Industrial power demand led this growth as industrial physical output continued to recover along with Brazils economy Commercial sector power demand growth also remained strong but residential consumption increased only as a result of the addition of new billed customers as demand per customer declined see Table Recent legislation to reduce the governments fiscal imbalances will likely continue to support Brazils economic recovery leading to higher power demand growth in the coming months Thermal power generation has taken on an increasing percentage of Brazils total supply substituting for hydro generation because of abnormally low rainfall throughout the spring months see Table Brazils thermal capacity is limited however and hydro reserves to meet growing demand reached critically low levels by the end of December The torrential rains in early January reduced the threat of droughtinduced shortages but by the end of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the South Southeast and Central West regions were only half of those in January Stored water in the North and Northeast regions was also significantly below the yearearlier level Although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise the increase is much slower than historical rainy season buildups Sustained rains must continue to replenish reservoir volumes for several months in order to eliminate the risk of power shortages Thermal Generation Remained High as Water Levels Stayed Low Thermal generation continued to increase in December reaching gigawatthours GWh or percent of Brazils total generation see Table This increased reliance on thermal power was in response to the critically low reservoir water volumes resulting from Brazils recent drought see Figures and Although thermal generation was tapped to replace hydro power to the extent possible hydro generators continued to produce power at levels similar to last years in order to meet growing demand The strong rains in early January reduced the threat of droughtinduced shortages but by the end of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the South Southeast and Central West regions fell again to only percent of levels in January raising concerns among government regulators Stored water volumes in the North and Northeast regions were also significantly below yearearlier levels demonstrating that Brazils power capacity problem is affecting nearly all regions of the country Brazil is expected to add megawatt MW of new thermal capacity in as well as a further MW of nuclear capacity when the Angra II unit enters commercial operation This new capacity will help meet the expected increase in demand growth as Brazils economy strengthens throughout the year but will do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish Brazils reservoirs Industrial Activity Recovery in October and November Boosts Power Demand October met expectations of a gradual recovery in industrial activity This trend continued to gather steam in November pushing power demand growth to levels not seen since April Octobers industrial physical output expanded percent compared with that of September and percent compared with that of October reaching the highest level since September In November industrial output slowed slightly dropping percent compared with October but remained percent above November levels Power demand grew accordingly reaching percent in October and in November making industrial power demand Brazils fastestgrowing sector for the month The yeartodate contraction in industrial output continued to shrink with cumulative output through November only percent lower than the same period in This recovery was enough to bring yeartodate power demand into positive growth numbers for the first time increasing percent over J anuaryNovember October and November brought the strongest growth to the paper beverage and transportation materials sectors supported by improved prices in international markets and the start of the summer Consumer durable goods and capital goods also expanded strongly in October and November rising from their weak performance of the first half of the year Yeartodate growth has been strongest in oil oil product and exportoriented sectors whereas consumer durable goods and capital goods have suffered the greatest contraction On a regional basis all states with a few exceptions showed positive growth in industrial output in October and November Only the Northeast region and state of Bahia still suffering from a lower level of oil industry activity reported negative performance in October and percent respectively and Paran was the only negative performer in November So Paulo registered its first positive performance percent in the past months and four states registered doubledigit growth Esprito Santo percent Minas Gerais percent Ceara percent and Rio Grande do Sul percent Rio de Janeiro and Esprito Santo showed the strongest yeartodate growth while So Paulos total output remained percent below that of Part of the recent increase in yearoveryear monthly output can be attributed to the declining production levels in as the industrial sector had already begun to contract by October In recent months however there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output led by a recovery in international markets for export products and an improvement in the economic situation This growth is expected to continue in the coming months as Brazils economy continues to strengthen Residential and Commercial Demand Growth Slows Residential demand grew slowly in October and November increasing only and percent yearonyear respectively Even this limited growth is due entirely to the addition of new billable customers which has expanded the customer base by percent in the months ending in November During that same period percapita power consumption declined percent owing to cooler average temperatures in and a percent decline in purchases of domestic electronic goods The surge in consumer purchases following the Real Plan stabilization has now subsided and the reduction in consumer buying power following the economic downturn has helped limit recent sales and use of electricityintensive consumer goods Commercial demand grew percent in October and percent in November slowing slightly from recent months to give yeartodate growth of percent in November Much of the growth in commercial demand was due to internal tourism which has benefited from the real devaluation Increasing electricity intensity of new businesses has also played a role as new businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors Conclusion Although the recent rains have removed any risk of power shortages in the near term reservoir water levels remain dangerously low leading the government to develop an emergency thermal capacity building program The current rate at which dams are being replenished is insufficient to meet the nations needs within the historical rainy season Either heavier rains or an extended season will be needed to avoid droughtrelated power outages toward the end of In the interim thermal generation will remain higher than historical averages and new units including Cuiaba and Angra II will help increase thermal power contribution to the total generation mix As Brazils economy continues to strengthen in power demand growth will steadily increase This growth will be felt first in the industrial sector as power demand rises with increased physical output As consumer confidence and buying power increase in tandem with economic growth commercial and residential power consumption will also return to precrisis levels surpassing percent growth This combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will greatly increase the pressure for new generation capacity Many risks and uncertainties remain however limiting any projects ability to reach financial closure The continued delay in moving projects forward combined with an additional one to two years of construction once projects are made viable will further tighten Brazils supplydemand balance in the coming year regardless of the availability of water Full report bibliotecaceralaaltpdf

FUEL COULD SAVE SUGAR SECTOR La Gaceta Argentina Feb p The crisisridden Argentine sugar sector is looking to promotion of the use of alcohol fuel as a solution to its problem of surplus production which reaches some tons per year Most sugar mills already have the infrastructure to supply raw material to produce alcohol fuel and the move is seen as an alternative to crop replacement to reduce sugar production given that this would take at least five years to achieve Supporters also argue that high world oil prices imply that production of alcohol fuel would offer price advantages while the use of alcohol as a fuel additive could replace the use of petrochemicals which are not renewable resources The Northwestern refinery Refinor has expressed interest in the use of alcohol as a fuel additive in order to replace the use of MTBE given that alcohol has the additional advantage of being exempt from fuel taxes Refinor is testing a new proportion of ethyl alcohol and petrol for such a mix At the same time it is argued that the existing distilleries which produce mn litres of alcohol annually have the capacity to produce mn thus allowing them to increase their exports or meet much

HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Alexandre Bueno PM To BCC cc bcc Brent HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Brazil Power Octobers Industrial Recovery and Januarys Rains CERA Alert Brazil Power Octobers Industrial Recovery and Januarys Rains CERA Alert Brazilian power demand growth strengthened in October and November rising percent and percent respectively above levels for those months see Figure Industrial power demand led this growth as industrial physical output continued to recover along with Brazils economy Commercial sector power demand growth also remained strong but residential consumption increased only as a result of the addition of new billed customers as demand per customer declined see Table Recent legislation to reduce the governments fiscal imbalances will likely continue to support Brazils economic recovery leading to higher power demand growth in the coming months Thermal power generation has taken on an increasing percentage of Brazils total supply substituting for hydro generation because of abnormally low rainfall throughout the spring months see Table Brazils thermal capacity is limited however and hydro reserves to meet growing demand reached critically low levels by the end of December The torrential rains in early January reduced the threat of droughtinduced shortages but by the end of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the South Southeast and Central West regions were only half of those in January Stored water in the North and Northeast regions was also significantly below the yearearlier level Although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water levels continue to rise the increase is much slower than historical rainy season buildups Sustained rains must continue to replenish reservoir volumes for several months in order to eliminate the risk of power shortages Thermal Generation Remained High as Water Levels Stayed Low Thermal generation continued to increase in December reaching gigawatthours GWh or percent of Brazils total generation see Table This increased reliance on thermal power was in response to the critically low reservoir water volumes resulting from Brazils recent drought see Figures and Although thermal generation was tapped to replace hydro power to the extent possible hydro generators continued to produce power at levels similar to last years in order to meet growing demand The strong rains in early January reduced the threat of droughtinduced shortages but by the end of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the South Southeast and Central West regions fell again to only percent of levels in January raising concerns among government regulators Stored water volumes in the North and Northeast regions were also significantly below yearearlier levels demonstrating that Brazils power capacity problem is affecting nearly all regions of the country Brazil is expected to add megawatt MW of new thermal capacity in as well as a further MW of nuclear capacity when the Angra II unit enters commercial operation This new capacity will help meet the expected increase in demand growth as Brazils economy strengthens throughout the year but will do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient to replenish Brazils reservoirs Industrial Activity Recovery in October and November Boosts Power Demand October met expectations of a gradual recovery in industrial activity This trend continued to gather steam in November pushing power demand growth to levels not seen since April Octobers industrial physical output expanded percent compared with that of September and percent compared with that of October reaching the highest level since September In November industrial output slowed slightly dropping percent compared with October but remained percent above November levels Power demand grew accordingly reaching percent in October and in November making industrial power demand Brazils fastestgrowing sector for the month The yeartodate contraction in industrial output continued to shrink with cumulative output through November only percent lower than the same period in This recovery was enough to bring yeartodate power demand into positive growth numbers for the first time increasing percent over J anuaryNovember October and November brought the strongest growth to the paper beverage and transportation materials sectors supported by improved prices in international markets and the start of the summer Consumer durable goods and capital goods also expanded strongly in October and November rising from their weak performance of the first half of the year Yeartodate growth has been strongest in oil oil product and exportoriented sectors whereas consumer durable goods and capital goods have suffered the greatest contraction On a regional basis all states with a few exceptions showed positive growth in industrial output in October and November Only the Northeast region and state of Bahia still suffering from a lower level of oil industry activity reported negative performance in October and percent respectively and Paran was the only negative performer in November So Paulo registered its first positive performance percent in the past months and four states registered doubledigit growth Esprito Santo percent Minas Gerais percent Ceara percent and Rio Grande do Sul percent Rio de Janeiro and Esprito Santo showed the strongest yeartodate growth while So Paulos total output remained percent below that of Part of the recent increase in yearoveryear monthly output can be attributed to the declining production levels in as the industrial sector had already begun to contract by October In recent months however there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output led by a recovery in international markets for export products and an improvement in the economic situation This growth is expected to continue in the coming months as Brazils economy continues to strengthen Residential and Commercial Demand Growth Slows Residential demand grew slowly in October and November increasing only and percent yearonyear respectively Even this limited growth is due entirely to the addition of new billable customers which has expanded the customer base by percent in the months ending in November During that same period percapita power consumption declined percent owing to cooler average temperatures in and a percent decline in purchases of domestic electronic goods The surge in consumer purchases following the Real Plan stabilization has now subsided and the reduction in consumer buying power following the economic downturn has helped limit recent sales and use of electricityintensive consumer goods Commercial demand grew percent in October and percent in November slowing slightly from recent months to give yeartodate growth of percent in November Much of the growth in commercial demand was due to internal tourism which has benefited from the real devaluation Increasing electricity intensity of new businesses has also played a role as new businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors Conclusion Although the recent rains have removed any risk of power shortages in the near term reservoir water levels remain dangerously low leading the government to develop an emergency thermal capacity building program The current rate at which dams are being replenished is insufficient to meet the nations needs within the historical rainy season Either heavier rains or an extended season will be needed to avoid droughtrelated power outages toward the end of In the interim thermal generation will remain higher than historical averages and new units including Cuiaba and Angra II will help increase thermal power contribution to the total generation mix As Brazils economy continues to strengthen in power demand growth will steadily increase This growth will be felt first in the industrial sector as power demand rises with increased physical output As consumer confidence and buying power increase in tandem with economic growth commercial and residential power consumption will also return to precrisis levels surpassing percent growth This combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will greatly increase the pressure for new generation capacity Many risks and uncertainties remain however limiting any projects ability to reach financial closure The continued delay in moving projects forward combined with an additional one to two years of construction once projects are made viable will further tighten Brazils supplydemand balance in the coming year regardless of the availability of water Full report bibliotecaceralaaltpdf

FUEL COULD SAVE SUGAR SECTOR La Gaceta Argentina Feb p The crisisridden Argentine sugar sector is looking to promotion of the use of alcohol fuel as a solution to its problem of surplus production which reaches some tons per year Most sugar mills already have the infrastructure to supply raw material to produce alcohol fuel and the move is seen as an alternative to crop replacement to reduce sugar production given that this would take at least five years to achieve Supporters also argue that high world oil prices imply that production of alcohol fuel would offer price advantages while the use of alcohol as a fuel additive could replace the use of petrochemicals which are not renewable resources The Northwestern refinery Refinor has expressed interest in the use of alcohol as a fuel additive in order to replace the use of MTBE given that alcohol has the additional advantage of being exempt from fuel taxes Refinor is testing a new proportion of ethyl alcohol and petrol for such a mix At the same time it is argued that the existing distilleries which produce mn litres of alcohol annually have the capacity to produce mn thus allowing them to increase their exports or meet much

<33520137.1075859905030.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,brent.hendry@enron.com,2000-01-31 03:30:00,Gross Receipts Tax Cc is an attempt to give you some background on the work legal has done for Don in the last year and a half in trying to find legal ways to avoid paying the gross receipts tax on our gas contracts The issue came up in a staff meeting a couple of weeks ago and I wanted you to be aware of where we are on this issue When I first arrived in BA Don and I had some discussions trying to come up with a game plan to avoid paying the gross receipts tax The first attempt to avoid the tax resulted in a type of BrokerAgent agreement where we would act as the broker for the enduser for gas only purposes and through an agency arrangement place ourselves inbetween the producer and the enduser and transact on the endusers behalf so that the producer and enduser would not know each other This format was developed with the help of outside counsel and the tax group The commercial team lost interest in this approach when the complexity of the arrangement made it difficult to sell to the producers and endusers Additionally it would only work for customers who had their own transportation Some time later Fede and others in the commercial team came up with two other suggestions that they felt Enron could use to avoid the gross receipts tax problem The first example proposed for our review came from the telecommunications sector This tax avoidance method is based on the fact that the local telephone companies have the ability to bill for third parties and not include such amounts for purposes of calculating its own tax liabilities For example cellular phone fees of cellular phone companies are billed to the enduser by its local phone company as a separate line item and are not included in its gross receipts The commercial team suggested that Enron could specify in our invoices that we are billing for the producers and therefore not include the amounts invoiced in our gross receipts The billing mechanism used by the local phone company is based on an agency relationship where the endusers phone company is collecting on behalf of the cell phone company for separate services than those provided by the local phone company This is not a tax avoidance scheme by the telephone company Both the cell phone company and the local phone company are required to count the amounts they receive for their services however those amounts are collected as gross receipts for tax purposes It just so happens that the cell phone company uses an agent the local phone company to collect their funds We determined that this approach as a tax avoidance scheme would not work for Enron since the enduser signed a contract for the purchase of the gas with Enron not the producer making it impossible for us to argue we are a collecting agent for the producer Once it was clear that the first example was not going to provide the help we were looking for the commercial team proposed a tax avoidance scheme used by one of the small gas marketers The crux of this scheme consists of two provisions one in each of the producer and enduser contracts that they feel allows them to net their proceeds for gross receipts tax purposes The marketer enters into contracts with endusers that specify that the enduser may be billed by third parties for the gas they purchased from the marketer The contract also provides that the enduser would be obligated to pay the marketer the difference between what the third party billed and what would have otherwise been billed by the marketer pursuant to the contract the Net Amount The marketer also signs gas purchase contracts with producers with provisions that allow the marketer to request that the producer invoice the marketers endusers directly although the marketer would remain the legal counterparty to the contract with the producer The marketers logic appears to be that since they did not receive the invoiced amount directly they do not have to pay gross receipts taxes on the amounts collected by the producer but would only have to pay on the Net Amount This is the scheme that Gaby mentioned two weeks ago in the staff meeting We reviewed the documentation used by the marketer and reviewed the legal and tax issues with outside counsel and our tax advisors and came to the conclusion that the methodology used by this marketer is not legally sufficient to avoid the tax liability Further we were advised that if Enron tried a similar strategy Enron and its management would likely incur significant tax and legal liabilities The problem with the scheme is that what the marketer is actually doing is an operational netting of purchases and sales and not a legal netting for tax purposes Such operational netting does not change the fact that legally the marketer is deemed to have received the full gross amount from the enduser even if they did not physically receive the invoiced amounts There are legal methods that could result in a lower gross receipts tax but they require that the contract rights of the marketer be assigned to the producer prior to the delivery of the gas The marketers documentation I reviewed was while internally inconsistent and vague legally insufficient to actually result in an assignment of the obligation to deliver gas to the producer which would have been the only way to allow the marketer to avoid the gross receipts tax This would normally be the end of arguments on tax schemes that dont work but much is still made of the fact that YPF agrees to transact with marketers in this fashion and therefore the scheme must have merit The fact that YPF agrees to invoice third parties adds nothing to bolster the merits of the marketers scheme There is no tax or legal liability assumed by YPF or any other producer for agreeing to bill third parties so there is no risk for the producer to do so and no tax scheme endorsement can be argued In fact if I was a big producer dealing with a small marketer with little or no tangible assets I might agree to the same thing just because it would probably speed up the process of getting paid for the gas I sold to the marketer As a producer I would still be required to credit the amounts received from the enduser as amounts deemed to be received from the marketer The important point here is that whether the producer gets paid by the marketer or the enduser its gross receipts tax obligation stays the same The producer is not engaging in any tax avoidance scheme by billing third parties The question is not whether the producer can accept payments from third parties but rather whether the marketer can legally net the amounts it is owed by the enduser with the amounts the marketer owes to the producer by allowing the producer to invoice directly The tax law is clearly based on gross receipts not net receipts and our counsel and tax advisors tell us that this scheme does not result in the marketer being able to legally declare its net receipts as its gross receipts Once it became clear to Don that this marketers method of trying to avoid the turnover tax did not really work he asked me to try and develop another broker agreement format this time for both producers and endusers that would mimic the legal and commercial risks of marketing He wanted a set of documents that would allow Enron to be paid a fee equal to the difference between what the producer charges and what we would have charged the enduser He also wanted to keep the producers and endusers from knowing who the other party to the transactions were and wanted Enron as broker to assume all the same risks of nonperformance that would have existed if we remained the marketer in the middle I worked on a document that ended up being more complex structurally than the first broker agreement and more complex legally because of the parameters requested by Don I worked with outside counsel to review the structure but they ultimately advised us that the structure as outlined would not likely withstand a challenge by any tax court since the difference between what we wanted and a marketing agreement was simply a matter of form over substance Any taxing authority would have deemed our duel broker arrangement to be in reality contracts for the purchase and sale of gas because all the risks associated with marketing were being assumed by Enron As we could not come up with a workable alternative that would be commercially acceptable to all parties we stopped working on the document several months ago Additionally it became apparent that the document was so complex as to be virtually unmarketable to either the producers or the endusers I left the issue on my to do list for several months to see if I could come up with another alternative which I have not been able to do I cannot envision another structure that would allow us to retain our desired risk profile and not have to pay a gross receipts tax We could change our business to straight brokering but that alternative has never been considered commercially acceptable to Enron The only other obvious choice is to work on lobbying to get the tax laws changed in such a way as to put marketers on a level playing field with producers Please let me know if you want to discuss this further or if you have other suggestions for me to look at Brent

number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents of Japan on derivative

of emails being circulated internally about BAREP and from BAREP The current situation as I understand it is that ECTRIC the Oslo Branch of ECTRIC and ENA all plan to enter or have entered into derivative transactions with BAREP I also understand that BAREP consists of two legal entities one that sells options and one that buys options although It is not clear to me how this split structure will come into play for the transactions each of the Enron entities may be interested in pursuing BAREP is prepared to sign ISDA Master Agreements with both ENA and ECTRIC and is actively looking to start negotiations From a credit and legal perspective it is our preference to have only one Enron entity enter into a master with BAREP If ECTRIC is the entity that will have the most contact with BAREP then it makes sense to have ECTRIC enter into the ISDA with BAREP To the extent that ENA would like to trade with BAREP I would propose that ECTRIC enter into the trade directly with BAREP and then have ECTRIC either back to back the trade to ENA or otherwise account for the transaction back to ENA Pending execution of a master each Enron entity should continue to document transactions as they have been doing If this proposal makes sense to the rest of you I will need to know if it works from a regulatory and tax perspective Steve Janine is there any reason why ENA would not be able contact the traders at ECTRIC to have them enter into a transaction with BAREP and then have them back to back the transaction to ENA Please let me know if anyone else needs to give input into this issue or if there are any other concerns or issues that will need to be addressed to cover this situation Thank you for your help Brent Hendry Martin CT AM To Brent nron cc Tanya CT Subject ISDA

one master in place and if the other Enron office wants to trade with Barep we can do it through the existing master and back to back the transaction internally I do not mind having the master done from here but unless there are factors I am not aware of it would not make sense to split our credit with another master from London Tanya do you have any insight on this issue Let me know if you can

between Enron North America Corp ENA and Barep and one between Enron Capital Trade Resources International Corp ECTRIC and Barep In order to avoid duplicating work a way forward could be to let ENA and Barep conclude their contract whereupon ECTRIC and Barep largely could replicate the terms between the former in their own ISDA master agreement As to the ISDA between ENA and Barep please forward

Subject RE Union Spring Fund Ltd ISDA hello brent can you please look over and comment on erisa and outside counsel issues and any others you have i want to rap this up monday no reason why this has to drag on Forwarded by Caroline AbramoCorpEnron on PM From Paul nronXgate on PM To Caroline nron Brent nron cc Subject RE Union Spring Fund Ltd ISDA Caroline and Brent My comments to items and follow I am ok with Virginias proposal Ok I would argue that Union Springs position actually creates the administratively burdensome and somewhat silly situation it nominally see ks to avoid My suspicion is that Enron will not in fact always be holding Union Springs cash Please refer to the definition of independent amount A Independent Amount means with respect to Party A the amount s pecified as such for Party A in each Confirmation or if no amount is specified zer o and means with respect to Party B the amount specified as such for Party B which may be either increased or decreased from time to time in a Confirmation which amount as modified shall be the Independent Amount applicable for all outstanding Transactions provided however that in no event shall Party Bs Independent Amount be less than if there are any outstanding Transactions Further Paragraph determines the amounts of collateral to be exchanged So if Enron was out of the money more than the Independent amount all of Union Springs money will be returned As the transaction moved further in Union Springs favor Enron could be called on to post margin Assume the independent amount is and Enron was out of the money Under Union Springs transfer rounding proposal Enron would post Under Enrons proposal Enron would post Day the exposure increases to Under Union Springs proposal Enron would need to post another Under Enrons proposal no exchange of cash would be warranted until another of exposure had accumulated It is precisely because Enron wants to avoid exchanging nominal amounts of cash that we want the rounding amount to be We can increase the guaranty amount to MM Given the expected positions with Union Spring we dont anticipate that they would ever have a value at risk in excess of this amount As you know Corp will not provid e an unlimited guaranty Original Message From Abramo Caroline Sent Thursday March AM To Hendry Brent Radous Paul Subject RE Union Spring Fund Ltd ISDA can we talk about this asap thanks ca Forwarded by Caroline AbramoCorpEnron on PM Virginia Loebel ILLOWBRIDGECOM on AM To cc Michael Franko ILLOWBRIDGECOM Subject RE Union Spring Fund Ltd ISDA OK Caroline I think were just about finished with this Ive marked th e attached Annex and Schedule and hope the changes are acceptable You will see that weve accepted virtually all of the changes your counsel had made to the last draft as well as the new language that he inserted There are a few points that needed further clarification due to the additional new wording as well as some clean up where previously agreed changes did not appear in the document A very short recap Since you requested we specifically mention Phils continued involvement weve added language to the Additional Termination Events that allows for an acceptable replacement manager This would provide Enro n an out and also allow Phil to sell the company without all positions going into immediate termination I think it gives you the flexibility you require while still giving us a little room We agreed to all the new tax reps you inserted Weve deleted reference to providing WECI this is not applicable for us We will provide the WBEN We had previously agreed that audited annual financials would be available within days versus as in the document Regarding request for legal opinion In the past weve provided copies of our constituent docs showing were allowed to enter into these types of trades This has always been sufficient in the past We estimate the cost for an offshore legal opinion to be around We generally accepted the changed wording in Eligibility but deleted the reference to Commercial Entity we are not a Commercial Entity that uses the underlying product of the trade like a utility company or a refiner We need to make the ERISA change previously requested As written it does not allow even of ERISA assets and we do have these As requested weve added Phils name as the Manager Regarding the Annex weve accepted the Initial Amount required but need to discuss the Minimum Transfer Amounts and Rounding as written if we or you owe we or you must wire This seems both administratively burdensome and somewhat silly especially in light of the fact that for your part you will always be holding at least of ou r cash Regarding the Enron guarantee thanks for making some of the changes I see that the guarantee remains limited to mio which is something we can live with and will just keep it in mind as we book trades Let me know your thoughts Virginia M Loebel ENRON ISDA DOC Original

Argentina Forwarded by Brent HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Scott Neal PM To Don BlackENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Scott PorterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Brent HendryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT William O ButlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re Brazilian Transaction Taxes FYI Forwarded by Scott NealENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Beth Rosen PM To Scott NealENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jordan CT Subject Re Brazilian Transaction Taxes Scott I have provided some comments below in response to your questions regarding Brazil trading activities About a year ago Jordan and I went with Brent and others to Sao Paulo to do some preliminary due diligence on Brazil trading issues At that time there were a number of open issues regarding the legal regulatory and commercial aspects of conducting trading activities in Brazil that would effect our planning For example it was not known whether a Brazil trading office would be considered a financial institution an important characterization as financial institutions are subject to a different tax regime In any event the following should give you a flavor of the regime I am also sending you under separate cover some general information regarding doing business in brazil Brazil imposes two gross receipts taxes called Pis and Cofins The Pis rate is and the Cofins rates has just increased from to effective February PisCofins operate like the Argentine turnover taxes except that PisCofins are federal taxes as compared to Argentinas turnover taxes which are assessed at the provincial level Strictly speaking Brazil law considers amounts paid for PisCofins to be social contributions and not taxes as the funds are earmarked for certain social welfare programs As a result the PisCofins are considered sacred and except as outlined below there are no exemptions or opportunities to avoid payment of PisCofins There are only two exceptions to the payment of PisCofins First export sales by Brazilian companies are not subject to gross receipts taxes The second exemption is that charitable foundations are exempt from Pis and Cofins Prior to Brazils recently introduced tax reform package financial institutions paid a higher rate of income tax but were exempt from the Cofins tax Pis was still due Now financial institutions must pay Cofins To mitigate the cascading effect of PisCofins in some of our power project under development we have looked at but not implemented forming consortiums with some of our suppliers gas suppliers Under this scenario a portion of the energy payment is allocated to each supplier who is taxable only on the portion of the tariff to which he contributed A consortium is a legal arrangement that applies to a specific transaction and specific customers It may not be compatible in the context of a trading office Brazil has a value added tax regime which is administered by each state There can be mismatches between VAT paid and collected depending on the particular jurisdiction in which a commodity is bought and resold The VAT regimes differs for gas and power trading so we would have to analyze each specific transaction in order to evaluation whether VAT would represent a cost to the Brazil tradeco I am sending to you some information provided by Arthur Andersen which describes the VAT on sales and resales of gas and electricity under several scenarios I am also checking on whether Brazil imposes any energy specific taxes and will follow up you separately on this issue Regards and all the best in Beth To Beth RosenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Brazilan Transaction Taxes Beth I think we have a

Argentina Forwarded by Brent HendryENRONDEVELOPMENT on AM Scott Neal PM To Don BlackENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Scott PorterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Brent HendryENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT William O ButlerENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Re Brazilian Transaction Taxes FYI Forwarded by Scott NealENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Beth Rosen PM To Scott NealENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Jordan CT Subject Re Brazilian Transaction Taxes Scott I have provided some comments below in response to your questions regarding Brazil trading activities About a year ago Jordan and I went with Brent and others to Sao Paulo to do some preliminary due diligence on Brazil trading issues At that time there were a number of open issues regarding the legal regulatory and commercial aspects of conducting trading activities in Brazil that would effect our planning For example it was not known whether a Brazil trading office would be considered a financial institution an important characterization as financial institutions are subject to a different tax regime In any event the following should give you a flavor of the regime I am also sending you under separate cover some general information regarding doing business in brazil Brazil imposes two gross receipts taxes called Pis and Cofins The Pis rate is and the Cofins rates has just increased from to effective February PisCofins operate like the Argentine turnover taxes except that PisCofins are federal taxes as compared to Argentinas turnover taxes which are assessed at the provincial level Strictly speaking Brazil law considers amounts paid for PisCofins to be social contributions and not taxes as the funds are earmarked for certain social welfare programs As a result the PisCofins are considered sacred and except as outlined below there are no exemptions or opportunities to avoid payment of PisCofins There are only two exceptions to the payment of PisCofins First export sales by Brazilian companies are not subject to gross receipts taxes The second exemption is that charitable foundations are exempt from Pis and Cofins Prior to Brazils recently introduced tax reform package financial institutions paid a higher rate of income tax but were exempt from the Cofins tax Pis was still due Now financial institutions must pay Cofins To mitigate the cascading effect of PisCofins in some of our power project under development we have looked at but not implemented forming consortiums with some of our suppliers gas suppliers Under this scenario a portion of the energy payment is allocated to each supplier who is taxable only on the portion of the tariff to which he contributed A consortium is a legal arrangement that applies to a specific transaction and specific customers It may not be compatible in the context of a trading office Brazil has a value added tax regime which is administered by each state There can be mismatches between VAT paid and collected depending on the particular jurisdiction in which a commodity is bought and resold The VAT regimes differs for gas and power trading so we would have to analyze each specific transaction in order to evaluation whether VAT would represent a cost to the Brazil tradeco I am sending to you some information provided by Arthur Andersen which describes the VAT on sales and resales of gas and electricity under several scenarios I am also checking on whether Brazil imposes any energy specific taxes and will follow up you separately on this issue Regards and all the best in Beth To Beth RosenENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT cc Subject Brazilan Transaction Taxes Beth I think we have a

the threshold level to be counterparty specific However I question whether taking the threshold level to zero might prove to be too low a threshold at least for Enron What is the danger of this

threshold level will work for everyone Is there a way to redraft this provision or leave it out and still accomplish what you need to After the form is finalized then you will need to talk to Dale

what if anything should be inserted for the event of default threshold amount I have also copied Susan Musch on this email so that she can determine if all is well from the tax perspective Once Susan signsoff from the tax perspective please inform me as to what needs to be done to load the GTCs noting that the existing EOL GTCs for Japanese weather are utilizing Enron Australia Finance Pty Limited as the counterparty My understanding is that those GTCs will then be removed I have also copied David Minns in Australia so that he is aware of the status of this matter Cheers John Brent Hendry AM To John nron cc Mark CT Subject Re Japanese Weather Derivative GTCs for EOL John I am attaching the GTC with a few changes marked in the draft Is this GTC only intended to be used between Enron Japan Corp and a Japanese counterparty The GTCs have been tailored for Japanese counterparties With respect to footnote number you are correct the issue is covered under f Noted With respect to footnote number unless one of the parties to a transaction is a US counterparty or there is a local law requirement I am not sure we need representation b We obtain essentially the same representation from the counterparty under representation d Noted and agreed I would recommend reinserting the paragraph entitled Early Termination that you have deleted Enron prefers to have Loss apply for valuations upon early termination especially in situations where there is not a liquid market or for unusual or longdated trades I think the weather market is one where Enron would prefer to use the Loss method of calculation See a and b and inform me if this is sufficient I would also reinsert the designation that Enron is the Calculation Agent unless there is a good reason to not designate a Calculation Agent See d and inform me if this is sufficient I assume that the payee tax representations are not applicable because there is no withholding for either residents or nonresidents of Japan on derivative

lot of emails being circulated internally about BAREP and from BAREP The current situation as I understand it is that ECTRIC the Oslo Branch of ECTRIC and ENA all plan to enter or have entered into derivative transactions with BAREP I also understand that BAREP consists of two legal entities one that sells options and one that buys options although It is not clear to me how this split structure will come into play for the transactions each of the Enron entities may be interested in pursuing BAREP is prepared to sign ISDA Master Agreements with both ENA and ECTRIC and is actively looking to start negotiations From a credit and legal perspective it is our preference to have only one Enron entity enter into a master with BAREP If ECTRIC is the entity that will have the most contact with BAREP then it makes sense to have ECTRIC enter into the ISDA with BAREP To the extent that ENA would like to trade with BAREP I would propose that ECTRIC enter into the trade directly with BAREP and then have ECTRIC either back to back the trade to ENA or otherwise account for the transaction back to ENA Pending execution of a master each Enron entity should continue to document transactions as they have been doing If this proposal makes sense to the rest of you I will need to know if it works from a regulatory and tax perspective Steve Janine is there any reason why ENA would not be able contact the traders at ECTRIC to have them enter into a transaction with BAREP and then have them back to back the transaction to ENA Please let me know if anyone else needs to give input into this issue or if there are any other concerns or issues that will need to be addressed to cover this situation Thank you for your help Brent Hendry Martin CT AM To Brent nron cc Tanya CT Subject ISDA

one master in place and if the other Enron office wants to trade with Barep we can do it through the existing master and back to back the transaction internally I do not mind having the master done from here but unless there are factors I am not aware of it would not make sense to split our credit with another master from London Tanya do you have any insight on this issue Let me know if you can

between Enron North America Corp ENA and Barep and one between Enron Capital Trade Resources International Corp ECTRIC and Barep In order to avoid duplicating work a way forward could be to let ENA

change Our outside counsel who is o ur expert on these issues does not agree the change is acceptable We need a citation to an applicable statute or regulation that would exempt the arrangement from the prohibited transactions prohibitions of ERISA You h ad indicated you would get them to send their references to a code section so we could have some new context in which to review the change As of

I am ok with Virginias proposal Ok I would argue that Union Springs position actually creates the administratively burdensome and somewhat silly situation it nominally see ks to avoid My suspicion is that Enron will not in fact always be holding Union Springs cash Please refer to the definition of independent amount A Independent Amount means with respect to Party A the amount s pecified as such for Party A in each Confirmation or if no amount is specified zer o and means with respect to Party B the amount specified as such for Party B which may be either increased or decreased from time to time in a Confirmation which amount as modified shall be the Independent Amount applicable for all outstanding Transactions provided however that in no event shall Party Bs Independent Amount be less than if there are any outstanding Transactions Further Paragraph determines the amounts of collateral to be exchanged So if Enron was out of the money more than the Independent amount all of Union Springs money will be returned As the transaction moved further in Union Springs favor Enron could be called on to post margin Assume the independent amount is and Enron was out of the money Under Union Springs transfer rounding proposal Enron would post Under Enrons proposal Enron would post Day the exposure increases to Under Union Springs proposal Enron would need to post another Under Enrons proposal no exchange of cash would be warranted until another of exposure had accumulated It is precisely because Enron wants to avoid exchanging nominal amounts of cash that we want the rounding amount to be We can increase the guaranty amount to MM Given the expected positions with Union Spring we dont anticipate that they would ever have a value at risk in excess of this amount As you know Corp will not provid e an unlimited guaranty Original Message From Abramo Caroline Sent Thursday March AM To Hendry Brent Radous Paul Subject RE Union Spring Fund Ltd ISDA can we talk about

just about finished with this Ive marked th e attached Annex and Schedule and hope the changes are acceptable You will see that weve accepted virtually all of the changes your counsel had made to the last draft as well as the new language that he inserted There are a few points that needed further clarification due to the additional new wording as well as some clean up where previously agreed changes did not appear in the document A very short recap Since you requested we specifically mention Phils continued involvement weve added language to the Additional Termination Events that allows for an acceptable replacement manager This would provide Enro n an out and also allow Phil to sell the company without all positions going into immediate termination I think it gives you the flexibility you require while still giving us a little room We agreed to all the new tax reps you inserted Weve deleted reference to providing WECI this is not applicable for us We will provide the WBEN We had previously agreed that audited annual financials would be available within days versus as in the document Regarding request for legal opinion In the past weve provided copies of our constituent docs showing were allowed to enter into these types of trades This has always been sufficient in the past We estimate the cost for an offshore legal opinion to be around We generally accepted the changed wording in Eligibility but deleted the reference to Commercial Entity we are not a Commercial Entity that uses the underlying product of the trade like a utility company or a refiner We need to make the ERISA change previously requested As written it does not allow even of ERISA assets and we do have these As requested weve added Phils name as the Manager Regarding the Annex weve accepted the Initial Amount required but need to discuss the Minimum Transfer Amounts and Rounding as written if we or you owe we or you must wire This seems both administratively burdensome and somewhat silly especially in light of the fact that for your part you will always be holding at least of ou r cash Regarding the Enron guarantee thanks for making some of the changes I

<11966498.1075860045811.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,brent.hendry@enron.com,2000-01-31 03:30:00,Gross Receipts Tax Cc is an attempt to give you some background on the work legal has done for Don in the last year and a half in trying to find legal ways to avoid paying the gross receipts tax on our gas contracts The issue came up in a staff meeting a couple of weeks ago and I wanted you to be aware of where we are on this issue When I first arrived in BA Don and I had some discussions trying to come up with a game plan to avoid paying the gross receipts tax The first attempt to avoid the tax resulted in a type of BrokerAgent agreement where we would act as the broker for the enduser for gas only purposes and through an agency arrangement place ourselves inbetween the producer and the enduser and transact on the endusers behalf so that the producer and enduser would not know each other This format was developed with the help of outside counsel and the tax group The commercial team lost interest in this approach when the complexity of the arrangement made it difficult to sell to the producers and endusers Additionally it would only work for customers who had their own transportation Some time later Fede and others in the commercial team came up with two other suggestions that they felt Enron could use to avoid the gross receipts tax problem The first example proposed for our review came from the telecommunications sector This tax avoidance method is based on the fact that the local telephone companies have the ability to bill for third parties and not include such amounts for purposes of calculating its own tax liabilities For example cellular phone fees of cellular phone companies are billed to the enduser by its local phone company as a separate line item and are not included in its gross receipts The commercial team suggested that Enron could specify in our invoices that we are billing for the producers and therefore not include the amounts invoiced in our gross receipts The billing mechanism used by the local phone company is based on an agency relationship where the endusers phone company is collecting on behalf of the cell phone company for separate services than those provided by the local phone company This is not a tax avoidance scheme by the telephone company Both the cell phone company and the local phone company are required to count the amounts they receive for their services however those amounts are collected as gross receipts for tax purposes It just so happens that the cell phone company uses an agent the local phone company to collect their funds We determined that this approach as a tax avoidance scheme would not work for Enron since the enduser signed a contract for the purchase of the gas with Enron not the producer making it impossible for us to argue we are a collecting agent for the producer Once it was clear that the first example was not going to provide the help we were looking for the commercial team proposed a tax avoidance scheme used by one of the small gas marketers The crux of this scheme consists of two provisions one in each of the producer and enduser contracts that they feel allows them to net their proceeds for gross receipts tax purposes The marketer enters into contracts with endusers that specify that the enduser may be billed by third parties for the gas they purchased from the marketer The contract also provides that the enduser would be obligated to pay the marketer the difference between what the third party billed and what would have otherwise been billed by the marketer pursuant to the contract the Net Amount The marketer also signs gas purchase contracts with producers with provisions that allow the marketer to request that the producer invoice the marketers endusers directly although the marketer would remain the legal counterparty to the contract with the producer The marketers logic appears to be that since they did not receive the invoiced amount directly they do not have to pay gross receipts taxes on the amounts collected by the producer but would only have to pay on the Net Amount This is the scheme that Gaby mentioned two weeks ago in the staff meeting We reviewed the documentation used by the marketer and reviewed the legal and tax issues with outside counsel and our tax advisors and came to the conclusion that the methodology used by this marketer is not legally sufficient to avoid the tax liability Further we were advised that if Enron tried a similar strategy Enron and its management would likely incur significant tax and legal liabilities The problem with the scheme is that what the marketer is actually doing is an operational netting of purchases and sales and not a legal netting for tax purposes Such operational netting does not change the fact that legally the marketer is deemed to have received the full gross amount from the enduser even if they did not physically receive the invoiced amounts There are legal methods that could result in a lower gross receipts tax but they require that the contract rights of the marketer be assigned to the producer prior to the delivery of the gas The marketers documentation I reviewed was while internally inconsistent and vague legally insufficient to actually result in an assignment of the obligation to deliver gas to the producer which would have been the only way to allow the marketer to avoid the gross receipts tax This would normally be the end of arguments on tax schemes that dont work but much is still made of the fact that YPF agrees to transact with marketers in this fashion and therefore the scheme must have merit The fact that YPF agrees to invoice third parties adds nothing to bolster the merits of the marketers scheme There is no tax or legal liability assumed by YPF or any other producer for agreeing to bill third parties so there is no risk for the producer to do so and no tax scheme endorsement can be argued In fact if I was a big producer dealing with a small marketer with little or no tangible assets I might agree to the same thing just because it would probably speed up the process of getting paid for the gas I sold to the marketer As a producer I would still be required to credit the amounts received from the enduser as amounts deemed to be received from the marketer The important point here is that whether the producer gets paid by the marketer or the enduser its gross receipts tax obligation stays the same The producer is not engaging in any tax avoidance scheme by billing third parties The question is not whether the producer can accept payments from third parties but rather whether the marketer can legally net the amounts it is owed by the enduser with the amounts the marketer owes to the producer by allowing the producer to invoice directly The tax law is clearly based on gross receipts not net receipts and our counsel and tax advisors tell us that this scheme does not result in the marketer being able to legally declare its net receipts as its gross receipts Once it became clear to Don that this marketers method of trying to avoid the turnover tax did not really work he asked me to try and develop another broker agreement format this time for both producers and endusers that would mimic the legal and commercial risks of marketing He wanted a set of documents that would allow Enron to be paid a fee equal to the difference between what the producer charges and what we would have charged the enduser He also wanted to keep the producers and endusers from knowing who the other party to the transactions were and wanted Enron as broker to assume all the same risks of nonperformance that would have existed if we remained the marketer in the middle I worked on a document that ended up being more complex structurally than the first broker agreement and more complex legally because of the parameters requested by Don I worked with outside counsel to review the structure but they ultimately advised us that the structure as outlined would not likely withstand a challenge by any tax court since the difference between what we wanted and a marketing agreement was simply a matter of form over substance Any taxing authority would have deemed our duel broker arrangement to be in reality contracts for the purchase and sale of gas because all the risks associated with marketing were being assumed by Enron As we could not come up with a workable alternative that would be commercially acceptable to all parties we stopped working on the document several months ago Additionally it became apparent that the document was so complex as to be virtually unmarketable to either the producers or the endusers I left the issue on my to do list for several months to see if I could come up with another alternative which I have not been able to do I cannot envision another structure that would allow us to retain our desired risk profile and not have to pay a gross receipts tax We could change our business to straight brokering but that alternative has never been considered commercially acceptable to Enron The only other obvious choice is to work on lobbying to get the tax laws changed in such a way as to put marketers on a level playing field with producers Please let me know if you want to discuss this further or if you have other suggestions for me to look at Brent
