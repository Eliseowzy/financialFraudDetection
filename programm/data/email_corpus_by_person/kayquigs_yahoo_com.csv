Last Update AM ET Jan Some sites safer than others for betting the Super Bowl CHICAGO CBSMW Fear flying to Vegas Cant find a friend to cover the spread Just longing to get some action on the Big Game Dont sweat Theres still time to bypass the bookie for a browser While creditcard issuers are making it harder for Americans to lay money down online for Super Bowl XXXVI See full story there are plenty of Webbased sportsbooks ready willing and able to take their wagers The trick is figuring out which sites to trust and to make sure a winning hunch gets paid off in full and on time The sheer number of operators along with their quasilegal status and offshore locations complicates that task But following a few simple rules can drastically decrease the odds of being victimized by a welshing Webmaster I would never ever play at a casino or sportsbook that doesnt have their phone number available Eric Morrispublisher Online Gambling Magazine By most accounts the majority of Internet gambling sites are run honestly Like the brickandmortar casinos they often compete with the sites dont have to cheat to make money And while there have been instances of bettors getting stiffed its far more likely to occur due to incompetence rather than deliberate ripoff The very first thing to look at before placing any bet online industry experts seem to agree is whether the site has actual human beings readily on hand to answer questions try to resolve disputes etc I would never ever play at a casino or sportsbook that doesnt have their phone number available said Eric Morris publisher of Online Gambling Magazine Spot checks Next do the research Check the message boards at review sites like winneronline and casinomeister to see what is being said about who and why Crooks and cretins alike can get called to account pretty fast in cyberspace if people are complaining about a specific site stay away Morris also recommends that players stay with sites that are advertising in multiple publications and newspapers instead of just using cheap or nocost online banners With that kind of marketing investment chances are they are legitimate and will pay you out Sue Schneider chief executive of River City Group an interactive gambling research publishing and brokerage firm echoed Morris sentiments about what consumers should check before placing an online bet for the first time To the list she adds they should see if a site is licensed by a specific government and if it has a Seal of Approval from the Interactive Gaming Council Although betting sites operate in some European countries and Australia they will not usually take wagers from people in the US Among the multinationals currently getting a taste of that action are Playboy EnterprisesPLA news chart profile Sun International SIH news chart profile and Rupert Murdochs News Corp NWS news chart profile Top jurisdictions While its not actually illegal as yet for Americans to make bets online the issue is such a political hot potato here that regulators in other industrialized nations have taken a pass on the market for now Meanwhile formal regulations for SouthoftheBorder operators vary from the relatively stringent and recently upgraded in Antigua to the virtually nonexistent in Costa Rica Frank Catania head of an interactive gambling consultancy that bears his name is a former director of gaming enforcement for New Jersey the nations No casino market after Nevada He describes himself as a proponent of player protection via strict regulations Players need to look for a site that comes from a jurisdiction with significant gaming regulation he said and named Antigua as the best of the Caribbean in no small part because he helped draw their rulebook He says other good sites are run out of Australia the Isle of Man and from a Mohawk Indian reservation in Canada In these locales at least a consumer can feel relatively safe that they are going to get paid he said Steve Schillinger is director of wagering at World Sports Exchange Based in Antigua its one of the mostestablished online bookmakers up and running since Schillinger claims a customer base of and says on a typical Sunday in football season we process over bets a minute Ways around Schillinger says his company hasnt experienced any problems with credit cards yet but that its still easy to bet should your issuer balk There are other ways to set up an account including wire transfers Winnings typically are sent via overnight mail he says and can be considerable World Sports Exchanges limit is per bet and people will sometimes make as many as five bets on a single game Business for us is very good he said We increase about percent in volume every year Those kind of numbers are one of the main factors that have some US casino companies panting for a piece of the action The management of MGM Mirage MGG news chart profileis among the industrys more outspoken boosters of the potential of online gambling Their counterparts at archrival Park Place PPE news chart profile are more lowkey about it but theyve also indicated they dont intend to be left behind Their theory is when Vegas operators enter the business theyll grab market share and greatly expanding the pie by providing bettors with USbased brand name service They also could leverage their existing databases to drive business and use a comp system to reward players with free rooms trips to Las Vegas and other cherished amenities That may pose something of challenge to sites like Schillingers if it ever happens In the meantime he asks with obvious selfinterest Where is your safer bet With a local bookmaker or a reputable online company that pays everybody Anyone care to wager on that one William Spain is a reporter for
