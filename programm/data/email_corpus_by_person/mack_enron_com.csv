meeting today regarding the following issues Meeting with Mark Braemer to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models to be released this summer Your willingness to let us use some of your data in files on the th floor to experiment with Moodys RiskCalc In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process especially the subjective component Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties Also thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the th floor We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down More specifically to evaluate Moodys RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enrons North American private firm counterparties Fiscal Year The prior twelve months of financial data are represented Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and EBIT The value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or Forecasts until the year can be made A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level In general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not Cash Equivalents This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities Inventory Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg LIFO FIFO Average Cost This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue Specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costs Current Assets This item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets Total Assets Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars For example should be entered as Specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances Leave previous years total assets blank for Australian companies Current Liabilities Liabilities are positive values Included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities Total Liabilities This balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest Retained Earnings Retained Earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders Typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions Retained earnings are generally positive Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings Leave this field blank for Australian companies Sales This item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers Cost of Goods Sold Entered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling General and Administrative Expenses Leave this field blank for Australian companies EBIT Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income Interest Expense This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt Typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities One measure of computing this is Interest Expense total liabilities Net Income This item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations A loss is represented by a negative sign For example a loss would be entered as Leave previous years net income blank for Australian companies Extraordinary Items Positive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations These items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes Expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values Leave previous years extraordinary items blank for Australian companies Country This model is calibrated for the United States Canada and Australia Thanks for your assistance Iris

in the UK is different from the way it is recorded in the US The date on Geoges document is ie October Again Jeff stated that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to sort out the public firm model issues Until then I am busy trying to develop the private firm model which is the deliverable we promised to Enron Credit as stated in the Elaboration Document I sent last week Best regards Iris Original Message From Salmon Scott Sent Monday May PM To Mack Iris Cc Kaminski Vince J Dhar Amitava Shanbhogue Vasant Kinneman Jeff Seyfried Bryan Fiala Markus Tamarchenko Tanya Subject RE Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Iris I also have copies of and have read the documents you mention while they contain some good information especially the movement model plan the meeting summary is just thata very general summary of a meeting with recommendations like hire quants and make sure there is adequate communication among the different teams The meeting summary addresses testing only briefly in saying be aware of the time dimension which is obvious and has been addressed by adding more equity driven ratios as well as our plan to add a time dimension to capture ratings momentum following a downgrade Perhaps you didnt understand my specific request for any ideas you might have to assist in model testing and also for an update on the Duffie report We still have not seen any drafts of what you learned As Im sure you recall the teleconference with Vince Vasant and Amitava focused exclusively on private firm models the scope of the project and data acquisition considerations After the call you suggested to Bryan Eric Mike and I that your report would include many of the issues in Georges documents movement model and meeting summary My personal hope echoed by Bryan at that time was that your report might be more insightful since the movement model as you surely learned in your visit is in its infancy and only one portion of the modelling effort and the meeting summary covered the most basic issues with minimal detail I sincerely want to establish a solid relationship with Houston Research and hope we can move forward together in a coordinated teamoriented approach I look forward to discussing it with you at our Tuesday teleconference Best regards Scott FYI George joined the company in Sep so could not have written the Movement Model proposal in April From Iris nronXgate on CDT To Scott nron cc Vince J nronXgate Amitava nronXgate Vasant nronXgate Jeff nronXgate Bryan CT Markus CT Tanya nronXgate Subject RE Scotts concerns about the Public Firm Models Hi Scott How are you Thanks for your email I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said Recall that during my recent trip to London we had a conference call with Houston research you Bryan Mike and Eric During this conference call Vince Vasant Amitava and I pointed out some of the issues with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models In addition after that conference call you Bryan Mike Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents EnronCreditcom Project Proposal Movement Model and Parallel Work Phases IV by George Albanis December Meeting Review by George Albanis I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May th Just in case you cant find them I will forward them again Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to repair the public firm models Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention Regards Iris Original Message From Salmon Scott Sent Friday May AM To Mack Iris Cc Kaminski Vince J Dhar Amitava Subject Report to Professor Duffie Hi Iris I wasnt sure if you had already sent your report to Professor Duffie yet or not but Ive been thinking about ways that his group or the Research team could really add value in an area where were admittedly weak model testing If you havent sent the report to him yet perhaps we can request his opinions on best practices for testing models with limited quality out of sample test sets Obviously Id like to discuss this in detail with you as well especially since you understand the characteristics of the models and data better now but Ill do that via phone Im hoping there are some statistical techniques were currently ignoring that we can employ to maximize the testing we do and get a better handle on judging our accuracy If youve got some time Tuesday after our meeting where Mike catches us up on the DB issues Id love to get your views as the model testbed is now in place and were starting a model recalbration phase Im least comfortable about our plans for stress testing the models once weve recalibrated them Looking forward to talking to you Tuesday Regards Scott
