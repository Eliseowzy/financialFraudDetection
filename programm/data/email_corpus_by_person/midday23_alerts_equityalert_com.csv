YHOO follows from E quityAlertcom JD Power and Associates and Yahoo Inc Report Nearl y TwoThirds of Airline Travelers Already Comfortable With Flying Again WESTPORT Conn Oct BUSINESS WIRE Five weeks after Septem ber a day that involved the worst air catastrophes in the history of th e United States JD Power and Associates and Yahoo Inc NasdaqYHOO re port today that nearly twothirds of airline passengers are already comfor table with flying again Only percent of flyers feel that they will nev er be at ease with the air travel experience The study was designed by JD Power and Associates and was conducted with Yahoo Inc a leading glo bal Internet communications commerce and media company More than ad ults were surveyed about recent air travel experiences and future air trave l intent Nearly one in five air travelers are still undecided about w hether or not they will feel safe traveling on a commercial jet said Mich ael Taylor director of travel services at JD Power and Associates But these are positive numbers considering that this survey was conducted less than five weeks after the September disasters This report illustrates t he faith consumers have that air travel will once again be considered safe However percent of flyers feel that air travel has changed forever The survey went on to ask respondents their perceptions about current sa fety procedures on aircraft and in airports as well as possible security me asures that could be implemented An overwhelming percent of flyers in dicated that they did not mind a longer checkin process at airports as lo ng as it increased the safety and security of the traveler More than oneh alf of airline passengers are willing to pay a security tax on each ticke t to provide increased security A lingering fear of air travel was the most often cited reason for the publics reduced travel habits said Taylo r However business travelers cited a slowing economy as another leading reason for a slowdown in business travel Leisure travelers listed wanting to stay closer to home as another important factor Among current inf light security measures respondents rated inflight armed air marshals and armorreinforced cockpit doors as equally important Arming cockpit crews and a ban on silverware in the cabin were reported as much less helpful in reestablishing consumer confidence in air travel At the airport a sear ch of all carryon luggage would inspire the most confidence in travelers i n addition to existing security measures at airports The presence of armed law enforcement officers at the airport ranked a close second The ban on cutlery at airport restaurants is not perceived to be very helpful accordi ng to survey respondents To increase public confidence in safety at the airport travelers believe that new technologies could be applied quite ef fectively said Taylor Hightechnology Xray and scanning along with el ectronic bombsniffing equipment were cited most by respondents These ite ms were considered even more effective than Federal control of the airport security process This public opinion poll was conducted among random vi sitors to Yahoos Web site during the week of October More than r
