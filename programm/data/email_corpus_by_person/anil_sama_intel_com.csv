Changed No CY PEPS NM NM NM Industry CONSUMER PRODUCTS Shares OutstandingMil Return On Equity DETAILS Quaker Acquisition Meets the Lions Share of Criterion Yesterday PepsiCo announced Quaker would be acquired for stock at an exchange rate of shares per OAT share with quasi collars around per PEP share CEO Roger Enrico stated the deal as modeled would boost the big financial metrics Top Line to EBIT Growth to EPS to and ROIC basis points In our view this one appears more likely to go for or for with higher returns on our calculations providing the most significant challenge As we stated in our note the mere act of doing the deal on a pooling basis does not change the fact that billion in stock will be floated PEP share thereby boosting the capital base by which ROIC is measured In addition we believe earnings accretion relies to some degree on integration savings which may be unbundled as nonstrategic food businesses and their distribution systems are eventually sold Add More To the Core PEP has long maintained the higher degree of onthego food consumption necessitates increased product offerings around FritoLay in North America Quakers grain based snacks and nutrition bars may fit the bill but can they produce enough turns to make it inside Fritos vaunted DSD direct store delivery trucks If so why has PEP not previously attempted to carve its own niche We expect a volume pop as newly freed up system capacity pushes the new snacks but do not know whether the Gatorade power bar and Quaker Rice Cakes can produce a sustainable channel presence For example in most core products Fritos Doritos Lays PEP is the undisputed industry leader where a viable number two player really does not exist Many of the newly acquired add more ideas target the morning day part and are likely to face formidable competition from Kraft General Mills and Kellogg In short we believe food expansion outside of salty snacks is laudable ie it may be difficult to growing at the same historic rate as the last ten years but PEPs impressive supply chain power and value to retailers may not readily overcome significant execution risk and heightened competition The Gator Gumshoes The clearcut winner appears to be the Pepsi bottlers Management is justifiably muted in defining the Gatorade PBGWH opportunity in broad terms why disprupt OATs established warehouse distribution More to the point we believe management recognizes that much like SOBE its new albeit smaller alt beverage brethren significant distribution retooling at the outset risks disruption at retail However we expect the system bottlers to create volume opportunities immediately For example if only PBGs vending and up and down street distribution capabilities were deployed the incremental case volume contribution could create additional growth points in the first year Given such new portal potential we are therefore puzzled by managements guidance for Gatorade sales nearly lower than anticipated results Is the bar being reset to make numbers Might the mighty green bottle be facing saturation in existing channels as it closes in on market share Or might the Pepsi system looking to improve Gatorade margins by gradually transitioning to lower slotting fees be anticipating minor volume disruptions On this last point we say minor because the slotting issue we allude to most likely applies to the convenience and gas channel where Gatorades indelible brand equity makes it a must stock for retailers We believe that lower CSD volumes in are highly instructive Even the strongest brands face execution risk Do food retailers really want to empower bigger suppliers PEPs profit contribution to retail is well documented Aided by strong brands in three categories and a very efficient distribution system it is a major provider of returns Gatorade as well as the nonsnack food businesses only augment this role In this light management expects its relatively underutilized Tropicana ambient juice brands Twister to get a boost Pure economics make this one inviting but from a retailer standpoint think Bentonville Arkansas does giving up leverage to manufacturers matter Again CSDs are illustrative of the potential risk Faced with an arguably better economic profit from higher CSD prices for the category certain retailers siezed the opportunity to boost private label shares at lower prices We note that The Twister portfolios brand equity is not nearly as strong as Tropicana Pure Premiums making the logically appealing distribution opportunity somewhat easier for retailers to resist Coin of the Realm Why does a company use its stock as deal currency Because it is likely fairly valued or even overvalued relative to debt based alternatives If there is such as thing as a cheap way to spend billion stock swaps in GAAP world is it When book value equity is used PEP return on capital actually rises via the OAT deal We impact ROIC for both Quakers Snapple charge and this deals anticipated writeoff However a share issuance which equates to much more will be floated We estimate the consideration of this cost on an economic basis ie what was spent would negatively impact return on capital by basis points In addition while a model based on the present value of future cash flows might produce a more favorable valuation we see three hurdles to building it No clear visibility on capital allocation or growth prospects for Gatorade outside the US In our view this aspect of the deal alone may be the ultimate arbiter of success or failure The integration of much of Quakers food businesses may be only temporary Execution issues on the domestic snack and isotonic businesses may yield a bumpy set of cash flows over the next two years On this last point we believe PEPs experience in restructuring during the period bears some consideration A more brand focussed horizontal business model would indeed prove superior to a more vertically integrated one that
