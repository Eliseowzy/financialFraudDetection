the Mahonia structure We would also like to realise the benefit of being able to rehypothecate securities that we receive under other transactions at the last count in the region of mm I am working with Clement to ensure that we can get the Chase Domestic Custody Agreement executed ASAP also working with Sara Teresa to ensure that the Chase ISDA Mahonia docs reflect our ability to rehypothecate securities Additionally I have been having discussions and assistance from Wendi Molly To get CRM signoff for Sara Teresa so they can proceed with amendments to Chase Mahonia docs Signoff from you regarding what tenors of US Govts will be acceptable as defined in our standard wording for Description of Collateral when we amend the docs What is anticipated will be required from an operational perspective once the docs have been amended to enable us to start posting securities I additionally requested the following info and am more than happy to reviewassist in reviewing the docs so that we are in a position to realise the benefits before year end Wendi has also been very helpful in offering to provide the infodocs for the following Who are the counterparties where we have existing collateral agreements that permit rehypotheaction of securities Can we immediately start rehypothecating these securities once we have signed the Domestic Custody Agreement with Chase If not what do we need to Who are the other counterparties posting us securities Counterparties identified to whom we can rehypothecate securities Who are we currently in dialogue with re assignment of securities what stage of negotiations are we at Im booking in a meeting with you later today to discuss primarily what approval levels is for US Govts another transaction Regards Soma Forwarded by Soma GhoshHOUECT on PM Soma Ghosh PM To Sara CT cc Tana CT Cris CT Clement NRON Tim CT Subject Rehypothecation of securities Sara I have already had a brief discussion with Tana on some of the points below would appreciate your feedback and clarification on some specific issues We are currently looking at ability of Enron to rehypothecate securities principally Tbills received as collateral Clearly the ability to rehypothecate securities that we hold can provide significant benefits The free up of funds that are being used to post cash collateral to counterparties increases our BS liquidity reduces the total cost of borrowing associated with posting cash We are reviewing the use rehypothecation of all securities posting for all counterparties Clement is in the process of executing a domestic custody agreement with Chase Manhatten Bank which will facilitate rehypothecation More specifically we are looking at the ability to rehypothecate collateral related to the most recent Mahonia prepay structure very similar to Alberta prepay The collateral arrangement within Mahonia provides for back to back transfer of collateral right through the structure This results in a net zero cash position if all parties post cash However if Enron receives securities from Chase that we cannot reassign to Mahonia an SPE the cash collateral calls we are seeing are in the region of mm approx mmyr in interest expense to Enron In the past Chase have interchangeably used securities cash They are currently posting cash however they intend to post securities going forward for this specific deal The most pressing issues going forward Does the existing Chase ISDA permit rehypothecation of securities We are looking at this If it does not then we will need to negotiate an amendment to the credit support annex Accounting treatment there are issues around the accounting treatment for rehypothecation under the Mahonia transaction principally relating to the acceptability of the same securities posted by Chase being posted to Mahonia SPE Chase equity in SPE thus linking all the swaps potentially bringing the prepay back on BS We need to justify that we can rehypothecate Chase securities posted within the structure AAs key point is that linkage occurs as the securities posted are most likely to be registered to Chase these are then posted back to Mahonia SPE with Chase equity Our case to support the use of Chase securities within the Mahonia prepay structure relates to Tbills are highly liquid instruments effectively cash equivalent Securities posted by banks are typically registered to a street name ie a brokerage house ie not registered to Chase if there is no physical delivery We are verifying that this is the case with the securities posted by Chase Market standard contractual terms permit use of these posted securities Re the last point I have looked at our the standard ISDA credit support annexe para c relating to Use of Posted Collateral section i It appears to say that regardless of a default occurring the Secured Party Enron has the right to sell pledge rehypothecate assign invest use commingle or otherwise dipose of or otherwise use in its business any Posted Collateral it holds Please confirm that that I have not misinterpreted this or missed out relevant exclusions Cris this standard ISDA language should further support our case to AA In addition I would like to clarify ownership title to securities that are rehypothecated in the event of default if a Enron receives securities that are then rehypothecated Enron defaults b the third party receiving rehypothecated securities defaults We are aiming to have the Domestic Custody Agreement executed within the next days we would like to be in a position to assign securities posted to us shortly thereafter for the Mahonia deal Outside of the Mahonia transaction there is currently an additional mm approx in securities being posted to us by our counterparties Going forward we will Establish who are the counterparties where we have existing collateral agreements that permit rehypotheaction of securities If we are receiving securities from CP where we are not permitted to rehypothecate we intend to amend the ISDA I would very much appreciate you response on use of posted collateral ownership title to securities in the event of default Many thanks Soma

the Mahonia structure We would also like to realise the benefit of being able to rehypothecate securities that we receive under other transactions at the last count in the region of mm I am working with Clement to ensure that we can get the Chase Domestic Custody Agreement executed ASAP also working with Sara Teresa to ensure that the Chase ISDA Mahonia docs reflect our ability to rehypothecate securities Additionally I have been having discussions and assistance from Wendi Molly To get CRM signoff for Sara Teresa so they can proceed with amendments to Chase Mahonia docs Signoff from you regarding what tenors of US Govts will be acceptable as defined in our standard wording for Description of Collateral when we amend the docs What is anticipated will be required from an operational perspective once the docs have been amended to enable us to start posting securities I additionally requested the following info and am more than happy to reviewassist in reviewing the docs so that we are in a position to realise the benefits before year end Wendi has also been very helpful in offering to provide the infodocs for the following Who are the counterparties where we have existing collateral agreements that permit rehypotheaction of securities Can we immediately start rehypothecating these securities once we have signed the Domestic Custody Agreement with Chase If not what do we need to Who are the other counterparties posting us securities Counterparties identified to whom we can rehypothecate securities Who are we currently in dialogue with re assignment of securities what stage of negotiations are we at Im booking in a meeting with you later today to discuss primarily what approval levels is for US Govts another transaction Regards Soma Forwarded by Soma GhoshHOUECT on PM Soma Ghosh PM To Sara CT cc Tana CT Cris CT Clement NRON Tim CT Subject Rehypothecation of securities Sara I have already had a brief discussion with Tana on some of the points below would appreciate your feedback and clarification on some specific issues We are currently looking at ability of Enron to rehypothecate securities principally Tbills received as collateral Clearly the ability to rehypothecate securities that we hold can provide significant benefits The free up of funds that are being used to post cash collateral to counterparties increases our BS liquidity reduces the total cost of borrowing associated with posting cash We are reviewing the use rehypothecation of all securities posting for all counterparties Clement is in the process of executing a domestic custody agreement with Chase Manhatten Bank which will facilitate rehypothecation More specifically we are looking at the ability to rehypothecate collateral related to the most recent Mahonia prepay structure very similar to Alberta prepay The collateral arrangement within Mahonia provides for back to back transfer of collateral right through the structure This results in a net zero cash position if all parties post cash However if Enron receives securities from Chase that we cannot reassign to Mahonia an SPE the cash collateral calls we are seeing are in the region of mm approx mmyr in interest expense to Enron In the past Chase have interchangeably used securities cash They are currently posting cash however they intend to post securities going forward for this specific deal The most pressing issues going forward Does the existing Chase ISDA permit rehypothecation of securities We are looking at this If it does not then we will need to negotiate an amendment to the credit support annex Accounting treatment there are issues around the accounting treatment for rehypothecation under the Mahonia transaction principally relating to the acceptability of the same securities posted by Chase being posted to Mahonia SPE Chase equity in SPE thus linking all the swaps potentially bringing the prepay back on BS We need to justify that we can rehypothecate Chase securities
