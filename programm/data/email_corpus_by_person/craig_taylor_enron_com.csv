who does not want to relate his war story In a lan d where everyone is quick to tell their tale his silence makes him unique He stood alone in the narrow midday shadows of the hospital courtyard whe n I saw him yesterday a mix of glittering fury and blank despair He had h obbled into the Red Crosss orthopaedic centre in Golbahar on Saturday Eve n among the other amputees his injuries stood out Mines can take off both legs and both arms or the limbs of one side or more often just a singl e leg or foot Karimullahs injuries however had a different cause When reluctantly he had finished accounting for the loss of his left foot and right hand there was nothing to do but leave the man to his bladeeyed star e The son of Tajik parents now years old he fled Kabul when the Tale ban arrived in Moving north to a village in Northern Alliance territo ry with his wife and two children he found work in a vineyard But he lost his job and home to a Taleban advance in He joined the Mujahidin A shell hit his post on the Samali Plain in It killed four of his comr ades Karimullah escaped to a Pashtun village whose inhabitants handed him over to the Taleban Tried by a military tribunal in Kabul after torture he was sent to the citys Pulecharkhi jail for having served with the Alli ance I had been there weeks when three Talebs came into my cell he said They called my name out and said I was to be released Baffled but relieved Karimullah was led to a Datsun pickup They began driving me t o the Ghazi stadium Karimullah said I was silent at the beginning but as we neared it I asked What is this What of my release They told me Wait you will be released The Datsun drove into the centre of the stad ium Karimullah recalls thousands of faces staring at him in silence from t he stands and between and mullahs on chairs in a line in the middle of the field He was pulled from the truck and told to lie spreadeagled on the grass The mullahs didnt even ask my name or speak to the crowd Sev en doctors approached me They wore grey uniforms surgical masks and glove s I could see one was crying They injected me After five minutes my body was numb though I was still conscious Then they put clamps on my hand and foot and began to cut them off with special saws There was no pain but I could see what they were doing I asked him if he stared at the sky He t old me he was transfixed by the sight of his foot being removed There wa s a sigh and murmur from the crowd when they finished It had taken about f ive minutes Taleban guards threw me into the back of the pickup One was crying too Nothing was said Even now I am unaware why I was chosen for am putation He was taken to Kabuls Wazir Akbar Khan hospital After a week eight of his former prison guards visited him They brought him apples and afghanis They apologised They told me they had not known what would happen I threw the money and apples back at them I screamed t hat they had told me I would be released and instead had taken my foot and hand for nothing They left On the tenth day he was discharged A taxi t ook him to his parents home They had no idea what had happened to him K arimullahs eightyearold sister Razia answered the taxidrivers knock on the door She burst into tears when she saw her brother sprawled in the back of the cab Worse was to follow My mother had been ill for some time so was very weak When she saw me she collapsed She regained consciousne ss for a few hours but then had a heart attack and died I thought the w orst day of my life had been in the stadium Coming home was worse Her nam e was Masherin She was He became a beggar his mutilation carrying w ith it the stigma and shame of the punishment normally meted out to a thief Then a few weeks ago a cousin a Mujahidin commander got a message th rough the lines offering him help Borrowing a spare prosthetic leg from a mine victim in Kabul Karimullah limped northwards for days crossing the f ront with other refugeesThe Red Cross is preparing a prosthetic leg for hi m but some scars cannot be repaired I am finished I have no future K arimullah said I have had everything taken from me by the Taleban Before they came to Kabul I was a student in the tenth grade an educated man wit h some chances before me Someone told me a rich Pashtun had committed a crime and paid the corrupt mullahs to use a prisoner of war for public ampu tation instead of himself I dont know if its true But I hate them I dream only of having my hand again so I could carry a gun and go to the fro nt line and kill and kill Id kill them all every Taleb

And this is only what we know You can be certain there is stuff that we dont know about and dont need to While youre reading this some of your fellow Americans are hard at work getting down and dirty and most of all being very nasty Just like in the movies but we wont get to see this take place Just know it is GO SPECIAL FORCES Special warriors role to terrorize terrorists By STEPHEN HARRIMAN The Norfolk VirginianPilot September This week Secretary of Defense Donald H Rumsfeld told Americans and others on a war watch not to expect a DDay In others words dont look for aircraft ships and cruise missiles to suddenly light up the sky over Afghanistan like they did in Baghdad in the first hours of the Gulf War Expect instead the administration has been saying a much more targeted campaign aimed at smoking out individuals and cells of terrorists from their mountainous hideouts Those who specialize in that sort of covert operation are the unconventional warriors of the US Special Operations Command They are likely to play a big role in this first war of the st century Their mission will be to terrorize the terrorists What follows is a profile of special operation forces units from the Navy Army and Air Force with a combined troop strength of between and The information was gleaned from publicly available material including official Web sites The Armys st Special Forces Operational DetachmentDelta Delta Force headquartered in a remote section of sprawling Fort Bragg NC is like the Naval Special Warfare Development Group Dev Group one of the US governments principal units charged with worldwide counterterrorist operations Both select experienced men from other special operation forces There are no women in special forces Their methods of operation too are similar small groups in and out quickly often under the cover of darkness striking with speed surprise and extreme violence Delta Force was created by Army Col Charles Beckwith in in response to numerous wellpublicized terrorist incidents in the s It is organized into three operating squadrons all of which are subdivided into small groups known as troops which can each be further divided into smaller units as needed to fit mission requirements Delta also maintains support units which handle selection and training logistics finance and the units medical requirements Within this grouping is a littleknown but vital technical unit responsible for covert eavesdropping and intelligence gathering Delta troopers are also equipped with the most advanced weaponry and equipment available A significant portion of their gear is highly customized and cannot be found anywhere but in Deltas lockers The Navys Dev Group based at the Navy facility at Dam Neck in Virginia Beach is an evolution of Seal Team the existence of which the Navy has never confirmed Organization and manpower of the group is classified However it is estimated that it now numbers approximately operators There is also an administrative and testing section which numbers approximately personnel It has been rumored that the unit maintains or has maintained a small number of Black Hawk helicopters but the majority of aviation requirements are provided by the Armys th Special Operation Aviation Regiment especially in support of ship assaults which frequently make use of the small MH Little Bird helicopters operated exclusively by the th The group is reportedly divided into five teams Gold Blue and Red for assault Gray for transportation and Black for reconnaissance and surveillance a sixth the Green team is for new personnel in training The Navy also brings to the table six Seal Teams with special covert capabilities on sea air and land Teams and are based at San Diego Teams and at Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base Each team has a headquarters element and eight platoons except for Seal Team which has of about a dozen men each depending on the mission The Armys th Special Operations Aviation Regiment Airborne provides aviation support to special operation forces The Regiment consists of modified Little Bird light observation helicopters Black Hawk helicopters and Chinook mediumlift helicopters The regiment is trained to work in conjunction with other special operation forces especially to insert extract and resupply them and to conduct armed escort reconnaissance surveillance and electronic warfare in support of their missions Its focus on night operations resulted in the nickname The Night Stalkers Three battalions are based at Fort Campbell Ky home of the st Airborne Division Air Assault and a fourth at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia The th Ranger Regiment is the largest ground component of the special operation forces It is the premier airfield seizure and raid unit in the Army One of its first targets could be the large former Soviet base at Bagram The base Afghanistans only allweather airfield would make an ideal forward operations base for special forces The regiment is made up of three member Ranger battalions based at Hunter Army Airfield Fort Lewis Wash and Fort Benning Ga Each of the battalions has three member rifle companies and a headquarters element Their capabilities include infiltrating and getting back out by land sea and air conducting raids recovery of personnel and equipment and conducting conventional or special lightinfantry operations Ranger units have a limited antiarmor capability Their only air defense artillery system is the shoulderfired Stinger missile Ranger units generally deploy with five days of supplies The Armys Special Forces soldiers Green Berets are carefully selected specially trained and capable of extended operations in extremely remote and hostile territory Foreign internal defense operations are designed to help friendly developing nations by working with their military and paramilitary forces The Green Berets are likely to work with the various disaffected indigenous people of the region to establish reliable intelligence The Special Forces Command is divided into five groups The th Special Forces Group Airborne based at Fort Campbell focuses on Southwest Asia and Northeastern Africa A Special Forces group has a headquarters element a support element and three battalions Each battalion consists of officers warrant officers and enlisted soldiers A Special Forces company consists of eight officers seven warrant officers and enlisted soldiers Green Berets are most frequently deployed in even smaller units called A Detachments or teams of a dozen men The Air Force th Special Operations Wing is that services major component in the US Special Operations Command with a fleet of more than aircraft mostly MCs that work closely with Army and Navy forces in the support of unconventional warfare missions Modifications to the MC allow aircrews to perform clandestine missions minimizing the chances of being detected by hostile radar systems The nd Special Operations Group based in England works with special operation activities throughout the US European Command and US Central Command Other ground units that are trained to conduct similar covert missions include Army Long Range Surveillance Units LRSUs the th Mountain Division based at Fort Drum NY the nd Airborne Division based at Fort Bragg and the st Airborne Division Air Assault based at Fort Campbell LRSUs are specially trained and equipped to collect human intelligence They observe and report enemy dispositions movements and activities and battlefield conditions avoiding contact with the enemy and local civilians The th nd and st divisions are large units that would be deployed only if an extended ground war developed All are light divisions and are supposed to be deployed quickly it took days to deploy the st and all its helicopters during the buildup to the allied strikes against Iraqi forces in the Gulf War The Marines also have special training in special operations Each deployed Marine Expeditionary Unit MEU a reinforced battalion a composite aircraft squadron and a service support group with about personnel is certified capable of special operations Each MEU contains a subunit whose tasks include deep reconnaissance and surveillance hostage rescue and demolition

Billy at Post Oak a couple of seasons ago It is a pretty descriptive awesome detail of September Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday September PM Subject My experience Here is my story A World Trade Center Story Tuesday September am I arrive at the World Trade Center complex Stop off at the bank in the tunnels below Two World Trade Center to make a deposit at the ATM am I arrive at the th floor of One WTC where my company SMW Trading has its offices I begin preparing reports for another day of trading at the NYMEX located in a separate building minutes away from the office am I am sitting at the table in the center of the office my back facing the outside windows Suddenly a horrific explosion An immediate change in the air pressure A ghostly column of air shoots like a canon into the office The front door slams shut Papers are whipped into the air Im thrown off my chair and to the ground My boss jumps out of his office a second prior to the explosion He had watched in horrific disbelief the entire event as the plane narrowly missed the empire state building and set a direct course for our building The explosion sends the tower shaking furiously lurching back and forth with sickening vengeance for maybe five or ten seconds I think we may die The building may topple over or crumble Finally it stops The building is still standing Everybody stares at each other no idea of what happened or what to say Speculations about an explosion a bomb No it was a plane our boss says A commercial jet Losing track of time I immediately walk to the door Someone screams not to open the door the hallway is on fire Curious Rob Opie Leder and I touch the door and the handle Its cool I open the door slowly cautiously to see whats out there Its pitch black out there except for the office light still on shining off of the billowing smoke in the hall The smell is horrible This is no ordinary smoke It smells of metal jet fuel of rancid concrete of things unspeakable I close the door People are still numb shocked confused Opie was the first to say it he was getting the hell outta there Im with you man I open the door again The smoke is thinner I see an orange glow outside the door a fire smoldering around the corner I hear guys in another office yelling for help or something too scared to open their door Nobody knows where the stairs are not even them Back into the office to grab some stuff The black SMW jacket I wear to the trading floor Its full of pick cards order tickets my empty water bottle Ice gum a calculator a pen a halls cough drop and trading analyzers I put on my jacket I decide to fill up my water bottle Opie waits for me ready to bolt Almost everybody wants to leave now Marvin Pickrum Where is he When did he leave Where did he go Is he in the bathroom The bathroom Someone check the bathroom I walk into the hallway inhaling the noxious stench and I walk down the hall To the left another hallway three small fires burning debris everywhere lights out In front of me another office another man peering out more terrified people To the right another hallway the bathroom and the stairwell I open the bathroom door everything in pristine condition Like nothing happened I call out for Marvin no answer Hes not in the bathroom We head down the stairs We move fast Not a lot of people in the stairs yet At Opie stops to help some guy break out some fire extinguishers We each grab an extinguisher We get to People are coming back up the stairs Whats the problem The door several platforms down is pinned shut People come back upstairs from below We walk out into the hall to find another stairwell This floor had damage Wires and debris everywhere A wall blown down into the hallway Some fires smoldering in the rubble I cover my face and try not to look Afraid of another explosion We find another stairwell at the other end of the hall In the next stairwell there are more people The descent gets slower We try to use Opies cell phone It was impossible to get a connection an occasional faint ring then everything goes dead The display read service unavailable at this time What try again later At about still trying to use the cell phone Service still down We stop on a large platform I notice a woman rocking back and forth directly behind me She was barefoot holding her shoes She asks me for a swig of water and uses it to wet her shirt and cover her mouth against the sickening stench She anxiously nervously tells me that she has two children and she has to get downstairs We start moving again She picks her way down quickly passing people where she can She makes good progress Shes polite Shes frantic At cell phones still not working I toss the investors business daily Ive been carrying with me Not exactly important stuff at the moment I think to myself that Im trashing the building and I feel bad At cell phone service still out A man with blood covering half of his face and a bandage on his head walking down the stairs Others pass with him obviously in pain People move to the right and let them pass Everybody is calm orderly supportive Nobody takes advantage of the path they clear Such calm such unselfishness in the face of tragedy Quiet adrenalin Rumors of a second plane People are making jokes to ease the strain We carry the fire extinguishers all the way down to the th floor Im sweating like crazy shirt untucked unbuttoned Im wearing my jacket still carrying the fire extinguisher At cell phones still not working I see a firefighter heading up the stairs A reassuring presence giving words of encouragement At more firefighters serious equipment in their hands on their backs At the door to that floor is open firefighters have set up base camp theyve dropped their stuff tended to some injured people Theyve secured all the floors below them Theyre working their way up trying to save the people above us At a man with a cane struggles down the stairs another man is helping him down After we pass these men things start moving Maybe he was the bottleneck We stop less frequently now At a woman Juliette is struggling to get down tired and out of breath We offer water and help she accepts We wait a few seconds for her to rest Opie takes her purse which is heavy and her jacket Opie walks in front of her I walk behind We tell people to pass us on our left Floor then and then At some light Outside light Close to home free We finally exit the stairwell into the lobby street level facing east and facing a courtyard I dont really recognize It must be in the middle of the World Trade Center complex In the courtyard I recognize colors Green from a small tree gray from buildings Blue sky somewhere Black too Black stuff on the green and black stuff on the ground small puffs of smoke It must be debris from wreckage What looks like a persons leg I cant focus my mind is wandering I dont want to look Firefighters lead us to the escalators They dont work theres debris on them that we climb over We go down slowly A few people complain were walking too slowly What if you needed help I ask That keeps them quiet We get down to the lower level to the glass doors separating One World Trade Center from the shops underground The glass is all blasted out Firefighters are showing us the way out through the doors An eerie situation underground The sprinklers are on People are worried about their clothes Shops are empty deserted Some lights above are still on Some arent Water collecting in puddles on the ground Ceiling tiles here and there A usually noisy active underground is virtually silent Firefighters are calling out to us to keep moving We pass a sandwich shop Banana Republic Gap entrance to Two World Trade Center The firefighters lead us northeast around a corner We stop Juliette wants to rest The firefighters urge us forward Juliette wants a swig of water Just then I hear a faint noise behind us it sounds like water rumbling No its people screaming theyre running a mad fury a tidal wave before the crescendo What are they running from Someone yells to start running We start running Part of the underground goes black Like someone flicks off the switch We take or steps Opie slips and falls sideways to his left People yell for us to get down We dive to the ground The blast is like a hurricane I find a small corner I ball up as fast as I can I cover my head with both arms I grimace mouth open teeth clinched For the second time in an hour I think Im about to die Things pelting me shards of glass pieces of debris I wait for something to sever me in two and then the chaos subsides Much later I find out the blast was WTC coming down I open my eyes Ive gone blind Pitch black Maybe I didnt open my eyes I close them tight then open them again Nothingness I take a breath Metal ash concrete I cough and breathe again More ash With each breath I take its more painful I call out for Opie and Juliette she answers he doesnt I call out again I fear something happened to him I call out again Finally a cough and a faint response Theyre both alive A few seconds pass Somebody steps on me Whats that down there A person dude Oh sorry I gather my wits and try to get my bearings after being stepped on Then a glimmer of light from behind A firemans floodlight Its hard to see anything at all The air is thick with dust and ash I begin to see silhouettes of people I see the man who stepped on me thats cool man I see things blown all around us I carefully stand up I see Opie hunched over on the ground He coughs some more stuff up and spits it out Opie slowly stands The fireman starts to walk by Others are following I pull Juliette to her feet I dont want the fireman to get away Hes not walking fast but it gets dark quickly without the light I grab for Opies hand The group of us develop a human chain We follow the fireman Another floodlight turns on in front of us Without the firemens lights we know we would be crawling in total pitch black It would take forever without their help We navigate slowly in the direction we had originally intended Bill Opie is that you Its Jonathan one of our firms partners in from Chicago caught underground with us Jonathan joins our group he knows the underground and its shops well We walk slowly about eighty yards We see light its natural light we walk towards it Its upstairs the street level We see another escalator we walk to it it has more debris on it We walk up it We get to the top doors in front of us to the right Broken glass Debris A large rug or mat its blocking the entrance but only slightly Well have to walk over it through the broken glass door to the outside Were almost outside We carefully step over the rug Were outside Outside its a war zone A monochromatic landscape covered in dirt and ash Like lint everything meshes into one color gray Were in a movie an abandoned city Visibility is at the most feet I never once look up Im still grabbing on to Juliette I feel like Im pulling her too much I slow down Im amazed at the amount of soot on the ground Several inches thick The air is full of dust and ash Just keep walking dont stop We need to keep walking Wheres Opie Hes in front of us I know I just cant see him We reach a street I think its a street its covered in ash We keep walking across the street Somebody comes running towards us shouts out to us look for bodies under cars A fourinch layer of ash and dust covers the streets I glance around for bodies I dont see any We start to walk by a church with a graveyard We stop I cough up the ash in my mouth and lungs take a drink of water and spit out blackness I tell Juliette to take some water and do the same Swish it around and spit it out She asks me where her purse and jacket are I dont know Opie had them Where is Opie I call out for him Now I dont know where he is I call out for him again finally I see him up ahead We start walking again We pass the church we get to another street theres less ash on the ground the air is better better visibility Juliette says she needs her purse She has no money She doesnt know what to do Ill give you some money dont worry Youre alive Be happy youre alive We continue walking We meet back up with Opie Now about blocks away from our exit a man is standing in a store doorway He opens the door and tells us to come in Juliette is exhausted she wants to stay there She sits down on some stairs Opie and I want to keep moving We tell Juliette that we have to leave We exchange numbers Opie and I each give her to get home We kiss her on the forehead and wish her good luck We walk about ten minutes People have lined the sidewalks looking at the building on fire We keep walking away Then a horrifying gasp people begin crying We turn around to look One World Trade Center goes down Our building We watch it go down floor by floor by floor Unbelievable Lets get outta here We turn back around and keep walking We come upon three coworkers Thank God your alive We find pay phones with lines people long We keep walking just trying to get away to call somebody let them know were alive We walk about thirty minutes We take a side street We find a corner store It has a pay phone Nobody is using it We take turns calling our wives our parents and our friends Were okay were alive We all walk home together I walk the entire length of Manhattan to get home to the upper west side On the way I see my sister I go to friends places I see other new Yorkers walking home Surreal Wednesday September am I receive a call from Opie
