determining whether to meet tomorrow It reiterates the value of having Sean OReilly attend mhf Forwarded by Mark FrankHOUECT on PM Ozlem ES AM To Mark CT cc Subject Re FERC Data Warehouse FERC Background When Sensecorp was hired to install the ACTA Rapidmarts Enron requested a FERC Rapidmart which had not yet been defined by ACTA In order to fulfill Enrons requirements Sensecorp hired a FERC expert Sean OReilly to assist us in defining and developing a FERC Rapidmart At the time that Sean structured the Rapidmart he stated that the FERC information did not appear to reconcile with FI appropriately and that some changes in SAP were probably required to ensure that the information was correct Also before Sean left he demonstrated to some Enron business representatives the functionality that would be available in the FERC Rapidmart but that the information would still need to be investigated and appropriately reviewed Project Sunrise At the time that Project Sunrise was initiated and there appeared to be some downtime for the Sensecorp developers I approached Beverly Fennessy to contact FERC business representatives to review the FERC information and determine if it could be used with a few minor changes I was hoping that we might be able to quickly complete something that might be of use to the business We then set up a meeting with the FERC representatives to review the data FERC Review However as myself and Scott Brudner reviewed the information we discovered that we are not FERC experts and all the value that we would be able to provide in a meeting is to demonstrate the tables that were selected and the structure of the data We would not be able to explain FERC how the module worked or what the information meant It seemed that there would not be any true benefit in realizing a meeting to review that information especially since we were aware that problems existed in the SAP FERC module which we would not be able to explain We felt that the only way to have a truly productive meeting and progress in the development of FERC was to have Sean OReilly return and assist us However since Project Sunrise is still in the business requirements gathering phase Beverly thought it was best and I agreed not to charge further development expenses to the project until we were in that phase of the project We thought it was best to investigate and further develop FERC once the project scope had been defined and FERC was included as a priority At that point in time we decided to cancel the meeting and informed the appropriate parties Business Interest As you can tell from the emails below there is renewed interest in reviewing the FERC information and furthering development However Scott and myself will not be able to demonstrate FERC functionality to the business anymore than was already demonstrated to them by Sean in August In order to provide true value we require the assistance of Sean andor a tremendous amount of time to become FERC experts ourselves Neither of these items are feasible by tomorrow morning Please advise how we should proceed Thank you Tzlem Forwarded by Ozlem MahmoodHOUEES on AM David NRON PM To
