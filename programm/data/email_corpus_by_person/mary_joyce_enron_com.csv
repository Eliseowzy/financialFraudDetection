To Joyce Mary Subject FW Enron payments can we chat about this please Original Message From Diomedes Christodoulou ENRON Sent Thursday October PM To Walls Jr Rob Cc Subject RE Enron payments Rob Thanks I am copying Jim on the entire exchange I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time now and my payments can no longer be delayed I think no one wants to assume responsibility for this and thats why I am writing to you and Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my standpoint These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or weeks late but MANY MONTHS late I really need to receive the payments in a matter of days All the best and look forward to hearing from you Diomedes Original Message From mailto Sent October To Subject RE Enron payments Dio I think Jims email address is I havent heard back from Mary Joyce on any of this In fairness to her things are a little hectic over here right now Thanks Rob Original Message From Diomedes Christodoulou ENRON Sent Wednesday October PM To Walls Jr Rob Subject FW Enron payments Rob Ive not been able to follow this to Jim I must be misspelling his name Can you please do so and also send me his email address Thanks Diomedes Original Message From Diomedes Christodoulou mailto Sent October To Subject FW Enron payments Jim and Rob I hope you are both doing well I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but the company is not even responding to my requests for information I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this ie WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious problems and potential losses I look forward to your response Thanks and hope to see you soon Diomedes Original Message From Diomedes Christodoulou mailto Sent October To Cc Subject Enron payments Mary Joyce I hope all is well with you I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI one of my affiliate companies and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler who I believe works with you informing me that I would have to wait until early November maybe even until late November as the changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday October Please inform me of Enrons intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights I look forward to hearing from you Regards Diomedes Christodoulou This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may
