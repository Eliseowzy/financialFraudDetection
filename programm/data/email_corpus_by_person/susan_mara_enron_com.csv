ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call if you have any questions Dan

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Weller Andrea PM To cc Fairchild Tracy Subject FW SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION I thought you should all be aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ oseph I Lieberman Jean Carnahan

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The

with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The website wwwutilityratefighterscom contains forms people can use to request a hearing to dispute the accuracy of their bills from PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Megan

multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The

legislation to go to Assembly Energy rate relief bill gets OK State Senate passes rollback legislation to go to Assembly By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER August SACRAMENTO The state Senate approved legislation yesterday that would cut San Diegos soaring electric bills by half and could credit consumers for excess rates paid since June The measure if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor would reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas Electric Co customers were paying in July While customer payments would be cut in half however SDGE ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by power companies The rollbackandreimbursement measure carried by two San Diego Democrats Sen Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis sailed out of the Senate with support from Democrats and four Republicans All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted for the bill The th vote needed for twothirds approval of the urgency measure came from Sen Bill Morrow ROceanside We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so incredibly painful for the people I represent Alpert told the Senate We need your help We need it now San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation legislation enacted four years ago But other areas will be deregulated within two years and legislators do not want soaring rates in their districts A vote on the AlpertDavis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a week because of potential opposition from Republicans Gov Gray Davis who is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June has taken no position on the bill Its important to keep this bill moving along said Morrow who said he struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the construction of new power plants The bill AB would cut rates to the July level and make the reduction retroactive to June of this year State and federal regulatory agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been improperly overcharged In the years ahead San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills but only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can be collected from those responsible Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for overcharging SDGE for failing to make cheaper energy purchases and the state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers I dont think anybody believes anybody is going to be percent responsible for this Alpert said The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug and reduce rates for SDGE customers by half dropping a typical residential bill from the current level of a month to The governors plan is similar to the AlpertDavis bill but its not retroactive to June and would take effect this month Critics of the governors plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an overcharge from generators marketers or SDGE Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network said that what Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction but simply a plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years San Diegans cant afford a pay now and pay later scheme Hoge said They are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis The AlpertDavis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the Assembly Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San Diego Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel support the bill and are listed as coauthors She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans Steve Baldwin of El Cajon Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be heard in committees rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors without public hearings To just ram through a rate rollback a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy shortage he said Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate checks that began going out to SDGE customers this week will solve much of the problem this year He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer The rebate checks are a million refund for overcharges related to deregulation and amount to for the average household An additional million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and September totaling for the typical residence At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon clashed with Loretta Lynch president of the Public Utilities Commission He

Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Hickok Rob Lamkin Rob Nichol robert berry Roger Pelote Sue Mara Jeff Crowe Dan Douglass cc bcc Subject Draft Comments for Thursday Folks Here is my first draft My time trial shows it takes min and seconds to deliver We need to cut Dan can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies Send me the front end from last weeks filing supporting EPSAs motion Ill take comments up to noon Wednesday gba The Western Power Trading Forum WPTF is a California nonprofit trade association of almost thirty members who sell buy and exchange power throughout the Western US We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week Price caps and their unintended consequences Forward scheduling penalties mandatory mustbuy and Independent Governing Boards First I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer and equally upset by the actions of nonjurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring and drive it into the ground As I listened to your comments last week I took note of all the things you said and the stated purpose of your actions After listening to you and reading the Order I very much wanted to be here today even if it only afforded me a brief minutes of your time I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly And that phrase would be Thank you Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive Californias wholesale power market Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving and absent of any national policy goals This Commission took a stab at correcting Californias problems utilizing several measures one of which was a price cap Whereas we applaud the Commissions effort we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load We have found that price caps misallocate resources and as your Staff report demonstrates increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists We find that price caps discourage demandside participation and at the level proposed will discourage much needed peaking generation resources We also find that any price cap but especially at the level you have proposed will create unintended consequences For example when market bids exceed sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX such as APX or AlTrade Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates and above which the bilateral market prevails That is a huge hammer a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another WPTF has been against price caps and continues to believe that price caps do much damage and do not protect consumers The damages include prolonging high prices reducing price discovery and reducing the quantity of longterm offers that otherwise would afford consumers muchneeded price protection Average prices do not diminish with caps in fact as you know August prices in California were much higher than last June even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was instead of We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators dont like price spikes and caps are a quick solution If you feel that price caps must be imposed then limit the damage We believe that Commissioner Heberts price cap proposal which starts at and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand or fuel price would be the most harmful Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability On the other hand floating price caps work in the opposite direction They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty and lessen stability If price caps are at all necessary stick to the least damaging approach WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand the imposition of realtime penalties and we support elimination of the mustbuy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation and reduced grid reliability Mandatory prescheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to realtime resolution Also by eliminating the mustbuy provision the UDCs can no longer complain about supply not showing up Their avenues for finding costeffective supply will be unlimited Finally we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems But it is asking too much we think to spare one and eliminate the other The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the wellbeing of the very institution on whose Board they serve We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers but in fact are making a power grab My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect if we have evidence if we detect or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest The California market simply can not survive serving two masters The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders and Thank you

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Weller Andrea PM To cc Fairchild Tracy Subject FW SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION I thought you should all be aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson

Douglass Dan Sullivan Harald Jensen Henri Fouda Ikram Elloumi Lee Marc Wolman Marsha Lin Ron Daigle Subject CA Power Crisis Washington Post OpEd Original Message From Kari Paakaula Sent Friday March AM To NAEP Team Subject Washington Post OpEd California in the Dark By Lawrence Makovich and Daniel Yergin Friday March Page A The common diagnosis of Californias electric power debacle is wrong The state is not suffering from deregulation Rather it is afflicted by a strange mutant ailment partial deregulation and now partial reregulation that has produced a flawed market California designed a market that disconnected customers from prices and at the same time made it neither profitable nor possible to build a new power plant The result is a serious power shortage Instead of fixing these flaws the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers and businesses And the shortage is going to get worse this summer Under typical weather conditions the state could face as much as a percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand which will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts The effect is likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few years California has made three crucial mistakes since the mids when restructuring of the power industry began The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price signals The socalled wholesale price what utilities pay to generating companies has been decontrolled but the price consumers pay to the utilities has not Consumer prices are remain at levels and Gov Gray Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase Although the price of natural gas which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share of electricity in California has increased dramatically consumers would not know that from their bills Nor would they know that rain and snowfall levels on which California critically depends for hydropower are at low levels As a result the utilities have been in the perverse position of selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying power from generators That is why the utilities are now billion in the hole and teetering on bankruptcy Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of supply and demand and then act accordingly the state is going to use their tax money to advertise conservation But years of experience demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very successful Instead of paying through their bills Californians will be paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up As California drains electricity from its neighbors residents of those states are seeing their power bills go up by percent or more We calculate that if rates in California rose by just percent a third of the shortage could disappear in a matter of months But instead the state has embarked on a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to come The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for capacity Electricity unlike other commodities cannot be stored If there is a shortage of telephone equipment the result is a busy signal frustrating but survivable But when it comes to electric power the equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout and that is unacceptable Thus a wellfunctioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate capacity That includes a reserve of capacity about percent above expected demand to cope with the unexpected whether its a heat wave a sudden surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants In contrast to other states Californias scheme did not provide any incentive for generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and granting permits to new facilities California is one of the most difficult places on earth to build a new power plant The environmental permit process in contrast to other states is complex cumbersome and deeply discouraging to wouldbe investors Companies will spend three or four years to get approval after approval and then find their proposal shot down by yet another local group As a result of all this no major new plants have been built in the state in the past years Meanwhile the California economy grew percent over the past five years In the same time its electricity consumption increased by percent The result was inevitable a shortage California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the power crisis First the state is signing badly designed longterm contracts for electricity in the midst of a shortage California cannot simply finance the crisis forever into the future This summer is likely to generate billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges which now appear likely to be on the states books to be paid over an untold number of years The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires to provide a multibilliondollar cash infusion into the states three biggest utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay The prospect of the state now the largest power purchaser in the market controlling the physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a chilling effect on power investment As a result the state could well end up having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future Third a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure for price caps on wholesale power But even temporary price caps because of uncertainty over their duration and effect would slow rather than encourage new investment Unfortunately the states current plans and proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority The priority need is first to move very quickly to increase supply and reduce demand and to do so now while the coming big shock is still a few months away Second the flaws in the market should be fixed taking advantage of the positive lessons of deregulation from other parts of the country But that wont happen without political will and a surge of realism Lawrence Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and Daniel Yergin chairman are coauthors of Beyond Californias Power Crisis Impact Solutions and Lessons The Washington Post Company

POINTS How To Raise Electricity Prices ISOStyle By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThere they go again The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high Like past antimarket moves Thursdays request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim Also as with past attempts the ISOs action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co and the states Department of Water Resources The ISO which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the states power grid has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before When the ISO passed a MWh price cap in the summer the cap became a target and caused prices to rise just as the ISO had been warned it would When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from outofstate utilities California generators sold power to the outofstate utilities which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup The latest attempt to suppress the market is mindnumbingly stupid The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices Merchant generators other western utilities and power marketers sold about billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January The ISO says overcharging accounts for million of that total Suppliers prices which the ISO agreed to pay at the time exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than and are therefore unreasonable the grid manager says Actual refunds might greatly exceed million according to the ISO once the FERC looks at the suppliers actual costs Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up for example should be discounted the most Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour What a great idea punish the smart and reward the stupid Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis and Eric Hildebrandt manager of market monitoring spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker In a supplyshort commodity market prices exceed producers costs Where they vary from wellestablished economic principles is that they find this unreasonable Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers including governmentowned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water Power and Canadas BC Hydro and begin hearings on refunds This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the per megawatthour soft price cap above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWh it would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as required But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California or a colluding group of sellers withheld supplies in order to increase prices according to the FERC ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert now chairman applauded the commissions decision to reserve price mitigation for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium

may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough

crunch time Greg Lucas Sacramento Bureau Chief WednesdayFebruary Sacramento Gov Gray Davis optimistic assessment that California may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California

up to million March Related stories F Electricity notebook F Power penalties repeal expected By KIMBERLY KINDY JOHN HOWARD and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Power producers overcharged Californians by more than a halfbillion dollar s for electricity over a twomonth period according to a study to be release d today by the managers of the states electricity grid During January alone the cost of nearly twothirds of all electricity purchased through the Independent System Operator was found to be excessive the ISO said The ISO the nonprofit agency responsible for buying and selling emergency power for the state said it will ask federal officials today to order the power merchants to grant refunds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December found unjust and unreasonable electricity pricing in California but stopped short of ordering penalties or refunds However the ISO has detailed million i n specific excessive charges and is asking FERC to order refunds disclose da ta about the market and investigate further Although Californias energy market has been deregulated FERC has wide latitude to set price caps if it believes rates are excessive We did some estimates based upon the availability and other consideration s of what the electricity should have cost said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis We found a big discrepancy Power producers said they would forgo extensive comment until the release o f the study However Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents buyers and sellers of energy said The ISO has the right to as k for this review but the costs were what they are People were bidding at the market prices which are legitimate costs in any electrical market in t he nation Accusations of pricing misconduct have swirled around Californias energy crisis but the ISOs study and its filing with FERC today will represent t he first time an agency has said it has evidence of overcharges and then taken action to get money returned It was unclear late Wednesday who would receive any refunds the state th e utilities or individual ratepayers The ISOs Department of Market Analysis alleges that price gouging occurred with as much as million or percent of the energy it bought in December and million or percent of the energy it bought in Januar y Total energy costs for those two months were more than billion compare d with billion for all of Sheffrin said This is a wonderful step for the ISO to take said state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who is on a Senate committee hoping to restructure the electricity market to prevent market manipulation There have been many accusations but none of them have chosen to act The new ISO study looked at power production the prevailing market conditions and the demand for energy and found that the cost of emergency electricity was far higher than it should have been Sheffrin said Further details of the study are expected to be released today Sheffrin said ISO officials have asked the power producers to supply information that would help them determine whether their estimates are accurate but the requests have been denied The power suppliers filed some of the documents to FERC Sheffrin said During December and January power producers had to provide FERC with month ly reports if their charges to the state exceeded thresholds The ISO did not identify the power generators it accuses of improper pricin g Not including the utilities themselves the major power suppliers in California are Reliant Energy Inc of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Mirant Inc of Atlanta Dynegy Inc of Houston and Calpine Corp of S an Jose Also on Wednesday Bloomberg News reported that Gov Gray Davis plans to as k power generators to accept partial payment for power sold to the states

Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the states three IOUs two of which are not paying their bills DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California Independent System Operator which runs the states transmission grid against Reliant Energy REI which wants to be allowed not to sell power to California if the state wont guarantee that it will be paid Reliant is concerned that it wont be paid for power being bought by the ISO on the utilities rather than the DWRs behalf Were willing to sell to the DWR but theyre not willing to step up to the plate said Terry Houlihan an attorney with Reliant The DWR has money for short and longterm power purchases It can avoid the situation if it does what the state Legislature said Then there would be no need for a restraining order The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to sell power to California Wednesday then extended the order for another day Wednesday night The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to California in midDecember when the US Department of Energy intervened with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to California on demand That order was extended several times but expired Wednesday Last week the California state Legislature moved to secure the states power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in bonds The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than the utilities While the bill didnt make the department responsible for covering the states power needs the clear message from the governor the Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the utilities couldnt buy on their own That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the states own mounting power bills Maviglio said The DWR has spent million to million a day buying power and has consumed around million since it took over the job in earnest on Jan According to testimony at Wednesdays hearing the DWR has left it to the California ISO to cover the difference between the realtime or emergency electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to keep the lights on The ISO in turn has been billing the states three investorowned utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers In emergency dispatches the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain price said Jim Detmers and operations officer at the California ISO If the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price then it will not procure that power The ISO will be forced to procure it Then the ISO will bill the utility wherever the power is needed The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt service obligations and power bills and have said they would already have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time The volume of power left over by the DWR wasnt known A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that to date the utility is unaware that its being billed for ongoing power purchases Pacific Gas Electric wasnt available for comment The ISO normally bills for power up to days after its delivered The California Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the operations of the ISO dismissed the generators concerns saying they were threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign longterm contracts at high prices The ISO however indicated that credit concerns remain an issue The credit issue is an ongoing problem Detmers said Some generators have indicated they would not supply California because they are not being paid Steve Fleishman an analyst at Merrill Lynch said California needs to take steps to alleviate those concerns In the end there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is willing to pay to backstop this situation Fleishman said Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in letter to Gov Davis Tuesday night Unless an immediate change in direction occurs the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the stage today for a return to creditdriven blackouts in California The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue supplying power to California By Jason Leopold Dow Jones

keep you posted Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY Times Staff Writers The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three years ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In the end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists and retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyone from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared off by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that the new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay for a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close to million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself and soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the state in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission and wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at the customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in

ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order

demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action

legislation to go to Assembly Energy rate relief bill gets OK State Senate passes rollback legislation to go to Assembly By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER August SACRAMENTO The state Senate approved legislation yesterday that would cut San Diegos soaring electric bills by half and could credit consumers for excess rates paid since June The measure if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor would reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas Electric Co customers were paying in July While customer payments would be cut in half however SDGE ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by power companies The rollbackandreimbursement measure carried by two San Diego Democrats Sen Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis sailed out of the Senate with support from Democrats and four Republicans All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted for the bill The th vote needed for twothirds approval of the urgency measure came from Sen Bill Morrow ROceanside We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so incredibly painful for the people I represent Alpert told the Senate We need your help We need it now San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation legislation enacted four years ago But other areas will be deregulated within two years and legislators do not want soaring rates in their districts A vote on the AlpertDavis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a week because of potential opposition from Republicans Gov Gray Davis who is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June has taken no position on the bill Its important to keep this bill moving along said Morrow who said he struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the construction of new power plants The bill AB would cut rates to the July level and make the reduction retroactive to June of this year State and federal regulatory agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been improperly overcharged In the years ahead San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills but only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can be collected from those responsible Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for overcharging SDGE for failing to make cheaper energy purchases and the state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers I dont think anybody believes anybody is going to be percent responsible for this Alpert said The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug and reduce rates for SDGE customers by half dropping a typical residential bill from the current level of a month to The governors plan is similar to the AlpertDavis bill but its not retroactive to June and would take effect this month Critics of the governors plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an overcharge from generators marketers or SDGE Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network said that what Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction but simply a plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years San Diegans cant afford a pay now and pay later scheme Hoge said They are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis The AlpertDavis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the Assembly Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San Diego Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel support the bill and are listed as coauthors She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans Steve Baldwin of El Cajon Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be heard in committees rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors without public hearings To just ram through a rate rollback a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy shortage he said Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate checks that began going out to SDGE customers this week will solve much of the problem this year He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer The rebate checks are a million refund for overcharges related to deregulation and amount to for the average household An additional million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and September totaling for the typical residence At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon clashed with Loretta Lynch president of the Public Utilities Commission He said the refund checks only go to residences and small businesses not mediumsized businesses hurt by high rates Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co

ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call if you have any questions Dan

Commission took a stab at correcting Californias problems utilizing several measures one of which was a price cap Whereas we applaud the Commissions effort we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load We have found that price caps misallocate resources and as your Staff report demonstrates increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists We find that price caps discourage demandside participation and at the level proposed will discourage much needed peaking generation resources We also find that any price cap but especially at the level you have proposed will create unintended consequences For example when market bids exceed sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX such as APX or AlTrade Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates and above which the bilateral market prevails That is a huge hammer a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another WPTF has been against price caps and continues to believe that price caps do much damage and do not protect consumers The damages include prolonging high prices reducing price discovery and reducing the quantity of longterm offers that otherwise would afford consumers muchneeded price protection Average prices do not diminish with caps in fact as you know August prices in California were much higher than last June even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was instead of We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators dont like price spikes and caps are a quick solution If you feel that price caps must be imposed then limit the damage We believe that Commissioner Heberts price cap proposal which starts at and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand or fuel price would be the most harmful Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability On the other hand floating price caps work in the opposite direction They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty and lessen stability If price caps are at all necessary stick to the least damaging approach WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand the imposition of realtime penalties and we support elimination of the mustbuy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation and reduced grid reliability Mandatory prescheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to realtime resolution Also by eliminating the mustbuy provision the UDCs can no longer complain about supply not showing up Their avenues for finding costeffective supply will be unlimited Finally we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems But it is asking too much we think to spare one and eliminate the other The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the wellbeing of the very institution on whose Board they serve We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers but in fact are making a power grab My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect if we have evidence if we detect or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest The California market simply can not survive serving two masters The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders and Thank you

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Weller Andrea PM To cc Fairchild Tracy Subject FW SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION I thought you should all be aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ oseph I Lieberman Jean Carnahan

Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The website wwwutilityratefighterscom contains forms people can use to request a hearing to dispute the accuracy of their bills from PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Megan

Douglass Dan Sullivan Harald Jensen Henri Fouda Ikram Elloumi Lee Marc Wolman Marsha Lin Ron Daigle Subject CA Power Crisis Washington Post OpEd Original Message From Kari Paakaula Sent Friday March AM To NAEP Team Subject Washington Post OpEd California in the Dark By Lawrence Makovich and Daniel Yergin Friday March Page A The common diagnosis of Californias electric power debacle is wrong The state is not suffering from deregulation Rather it is afflicted by a strange mutant ailment partial deregulation and now partial reregulation that has produced a flawed market California designed a market that disconnected customers from prices and at the same time made it neither profitable nor possible to build a new power plant The result is a serious power shortage Instead of fixing these flaws the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers and businesses And the shortage is going to get worse this summer Under typical weather conditions the state could face as much as a percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand which will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts The effect is likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few years California has made three crucial mistakes since the mids when restructuring of the power industry began The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price signals The socalled wholesale price what utilities pay to generating companies has been decontrolled but the price consumers pay to the utilities has not Consumer prices are remain at levels and Gov Gray Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase Although the price of natural gas which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share of electricity in California has increased dramatically consumers would not know that from their bills Nor would they know that rain and snowfall levels on which California critically depends for hydropower are at low levels As a result the utilities have been in the perverse position of selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying power from generators That is why the utilities are now billion in the hole and teetering on bankruptcy Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of supply and demand and then act accordingly the state is going to use their tax money to advertise conservation But years of experience demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very successful Instead of paying through their bills Californians will be paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up As California drains electricity from its neighbors residents of those states are seeing their power bills go up by percent or more We calculate that if rates in California rose by just percent a third of the shortage could disappear in a matter of months But instead the state has embarked on a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to come The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for capacity Electricity unlike other commodities cannot be stored If there is a shortage of telephone equipment the result is a busy signal frustrating but survivable But when it comes to electric power the equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout and that is unacceptable Thus a wellfunctioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate capacity That includes a reserve of capacity about percent above expected demand to cope with the unexpected whether its a heat wave a sudden surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants In contrast to other states Californias scheme did not provide any incentive for generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and granting permits to new facilities California is one of the most difficult places on earth to build a new power plant The environmental permit process in contrast to other states is complex cumbersome and deeply discouraging to wouldbe investors Companies will spend three or four years to get approval after approval and then find their proposal shot down by yet another local group As a result of all this no major new plants have been built in the state in the past years Meanwhile the California economy grew percent over the past five years In the same time its electricity consumption increased by percent The result was inevitable a shortage California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the power crisis First the state is signing badly designed longterm contracts for electricity in the midst of a shortage California cannot simply finance the crisis forever into the future This summer is likely to generate billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges which now appear likely to be on the states books to be paid over an untold number of years The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires to provide a multibilliondollar cash infusion into the states three biggest utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay The prospect of the state now the largest power purchaser in the market controlling the physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a chilling effect on power investment As a result the state could well end up having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future Third a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure for price caps on wholesale power But even temporary price caps because of uncertainty over their duration and effect would slow rather than encourage new investment Unfortunately the states current plans and proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority The priority need is first to move very quickly to increase supply and reduce demand and to do so now while the coming big shock is still a few months away Second the flaws in the market should be fixed taking advantage of the positive lessons of deregulation from other parts of the country But that wont happen without political will and a surge of realism Lawrence Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and Daniel Yergin chairman are coauthors of Beyond Californias Power Crisis Impact Solutions and Lessons The Washington Post Company

POINTS How To Raise Electricity Prices ISOStyle By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThere they go again The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high Like past antimarket moves Thursdays request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim Also as with past attempts the ISOs action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co and the states Department of Water Resources The ISO which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the states power grid has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before When the ISO passed a MWh price cap in the summer the cap became a target and caused prices to rise just as the ISO had been warned it would When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from outofstate utilities California generators sold power to the outofstate utilities which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup The latest attempt to suppress the market is mindnumbingly stupid The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices Merchant generators other western utilities and power marketers sold about billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January The ISO says overcharging accounts for million of that total Suppliers prices which the ISO agreed to pay at the time exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than and are therefore unreasonable the grid manager says Actual refunds might greatly exceed million according to the ISO once the FERC looks at the suppliers actual costs Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up for example should be discounted the most Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour What a great idea punish the smart and reward the stupid Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis and Eric Hildebrandt manager of market monitoring spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker In a supplyshort commodity market prices exceed producers costs Where they vary from wellestablished economic principles is that they find this unreasonable Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers including governmentowned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water Power and Canadas BC Hydro and begin hearings on refunds This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the per megawatthour soft price cap above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWh it would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as required But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California or a colluding group of sellers withheld supplies in order to increase prices according to the FERC ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert now chairman applauded the commissions decision to reserve price mitigation for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium

than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they want Email Greg Lucas at Copyright SF Chronicle

expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they want Email Greg Lucas at Printerfriendly version Email this article to a friend Feedback San Francisco Chronicle PageA Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

up to million March Related stories F Electricity notebook F Power penalties repeal expected By KIMBERLY KINDY JOHN HOWARD and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Power producers overcharged Californians by more than a halfbillion dollar s for electricity over a twomonth period according to a study to be release d today by the managers of the states electricity grid During January alone the cost of nearly twothirds of all electricity purchased through the Independent System Operator was found to be excessive the ISO said The ISO the nonprofit agency responsible for buying and selling emergency power for the state said it will ask federal officials today to order the power merchants to grant refunds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December found unjust and unreasonable electricity pricing in California but stopped short of ordering penalties or refunds However the ISO has detailed million i n specific excessive charges and is asking FERC to order refunds disclose da ta about the market and investigate further Although Californias energy market has been deregulated FERC has wide latitude to set price caps if it believes rates are excessive We did some estimates based upon the availability and other consideration s of what the electricity should have cost said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis We found a big discrepancy Power producers said they would forgo extensive comment until the release o f the study However Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents buyers and sellers of energy said The ISO has the right to as k for this review but the costs were what they are People were bidding at the market prices which are legitimate costs in any electrical market in t he nation Accusations of pricing misconduct have swirled around Californias energy crisis but the ISOs study and its filing with FERC today will represent t he first time an agency has said it has evidence of overcharges and then taken action to get money returned It was unclear late Wednesday who would receive any refunds the state th e utilities or individual ratepayers The ISOs Department of Market Analysis alleges that price gouging occurred with as much as million or percent of the energy it bought in December and million or percent of the energy it bought in Januar y Total energy costs for those two months were more than billion compare d with billion for all of Sheffrin said This is a wonderful step for the ISO to take said state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who is on a Senate committee hoping to restructure the electricity market to prevent market manipulation There have been many accusations but none of them have chosen to act The new ISO study looked at power production the prevailing market conditions and the demand for energy and found that the cost of emergency electricity was far higher than it should have been Sheffrin said Further details of the study are expected to be released today Sheffrin said ISO officials have asked the power producers to supply information that would help them determine whether their estimates are accurate but the requests have been denied The power suppliers filed some of the documents to FERC Sheffrin said During December and January power producers had to provide FERC with month ly reports if their charges to the state exceeded thresholds The ISO did not identify the power generators it accuses of improper pricin g Not including the utilities themselves the major power suppliers in California are Reliant Energy Inc of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Mirant Inc of Atlanta Dynegy Inc of Houston and Calpine Corp of S an Jose Also on Wednesday Bloomberg News reported that Gov Gray Davis plans to as k power generators to accept partial payment for power sold to the states

Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the states three IOUs two of which are not paying their bills DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California Independent System Operator which runs the states transmission grid against Reliant Energy REI which wants to be allowed not to sell power to California if the state wont guarantee that it will be paid Reliant is concerned that it wont be paid for power being bought by the ISO on the utilities rather than the DWRs behalf Were willing to sell to the DWR but theyre not willing to step up to the plate said Terry Houlihan an attorney with Reliant The DWR has money for short and longterm power purchases It can avoid the situation if it does what the state Legislature said Then there would be no need for a restraining order The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to sell power to California Wednesday then extended the order for another day Wednesday night The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to California in midDecember when the US Department of Energy intervened with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to California on demand That order was extended several times but expired Wednesday Last week the California state Legislature moved to secure the states power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in bonds The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than the utilities While the bill didnt make the department responsible for covering the states power needs the clear message from the governor the Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the utilities couldnt buy on their own That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the states own mounting power bills Maviglio said The DWR has spent million to million a day buying power and has consumed around million since it took over the job in earnest on Jan According to testimony at Wednesdays hearing the DWR has left it to the California ISO to cover the difference between the realtime or emergency electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to keep the lights on The ISO in turn has been billing the states three investorowned utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers In emergency dispatches the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain price said Jim Detmers and operations officer at the California ISO If the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price then it will not procure that power The ISO will be forced to procure it Then the ISO will bill the utility wherever the power is needed The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt service obligations and power bills and have said they would already have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time The volume of power left over by the DWR wasnt known A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that to date the utility is unaware that its being billed for ongoing power purchases Pacific Gas Electric wasnt available for comment The ISO normally bills for power up to days after its delivered The California Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the operations of the ISO dismissed the generators concerns saying they were threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign longterm contracts at high prices The ISO however indicated that credit concerns remain an issue The credit issue is an ongoing problem Detmers said Some generators have indicated they would not supply California because they are not being paid Steve Fleishman an analyst at Merrill Lynch said California needs to take steps to alleviate those concerns In the end there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is willing to pay to backstop this situation Fleishman said Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in letter to Gov Davis Tuesday night Unless an immediate change in direction occurs the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the stage today for a return to creditdriven blackouts in California The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue supplying power to California By Jason Leopold Dow Jones

we are concerned about Also Enron gets a lot of attention I will have this forwarded to the entire team later this morning Thanks Stevan PS Bryson is having a news conference this morning in Sac Will keep you posted Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY Times Staff Writers The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three years ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In the end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists and retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyone from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared off by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that the new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay for a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close to million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself and soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the state in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission and wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at the customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in

Lamkin Email Ross Ain Email Steve Iliff Steve Ponder Email Tony Wetzel Email William Hall Email Katie Kaplan Jean Munoz cc Energy Practice Group Subject ALERT As discussed yesterday Davis publicly demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action

legislation to go to Assembly Energy rate relief bill gets OK State Senate passes rollback legislation to go to Assembly By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER August SACRAMENTO The state Senate approved legislation yesterday that would cut San Diegos soaring electric bills by half and could credit consumers for excess rates paid since June The measure if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor would reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas Electric Co customers were paying in July While customer payments would be cut in half however SDGE ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by power companies The rollbackandreimbursement measure carried by two San Diego Democrats Sen Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis sailed out of the Senate with support from Democrats and four Republicans All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted for the bill The th vote needed for twothirds approval of the urgency measure came from Sen Bill Morrow ROceanside We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so incredibly painful for the people I represent Alpert told the Senate We need your help We need it now San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation legislation enacted four years ago But other areas will be deregulated within two years and legislators do not want soaring rates in their districts A vote on the AlpertDavis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a week because of potential opposition from Republicans Gov Gray Davis who is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June has taken no position on the bill Its important to keep this bill moving along said Morrow who said he struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the construction of new power plants The bill AB would cut rates to the July level and make the reduction retroactive to June of this year State and federal regulatory agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been improperly overcharged In the years ahead San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills but only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can be collected from those responsible Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for overcharging SDGE for failing to make cheaper energy purchases and the state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers I dont think anybody believes anybody is going to be percent responsible for this Alpert said The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug and reduce rates for SDGE customers by half dropping a typical residential bill from the current level of a month to The governors plan is similar to the AlpertDavis bill but its not retroactive to June and would take effect this month Critics of the governors plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an overcharge from generators marketers or SDGE Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network said that what Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction but simply a plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years San Diegans cant afford a pay now and pay later scheme Hoge said They are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis The AlpertDavis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the Assembly Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San Diego Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel support the bill and are listed as coauthors She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans Steve Baldwin of El Cajon Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be heard in committees rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors without public hearings To just ram through a rate rollback a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy shortage he said Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate checks that began going out to SDGE customers this week will solve much of the problem this year He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer The rebate checks are a million refund for overcharges related to deregulation and amount to for the average household An additional million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and September totaling for the typical residence At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon clashed with Loretta Lynch president of the Public Utilities Commission He said the refund checks only go to residences and small businesses not mediumsized businesses hurt by high rates Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co

demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action

Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

seconds to deliver We need to cut Dan can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies Send me the front end from last weeks filing supporting EPSAs motion Ill take comments up to noon Wednesday gba The Western Power Trading Forum WPTF is a California nonprofit trade association of almost thirty members who sell buy and exchange power throughout the Western US We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week Price caps and their unintended consequences Forward scheduling penalties mandatory mustbuy and Independent Governing Boards First I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer and equally upset by the actions of nonjurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring and drive it into the ground As I listened to your comments last week I took note of all the things you said and the stated purpose of your actions After listening to you and reading the Order I very much wanted to be here today even if it only afforded me a brief minutes of your time I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly And that phrase would be Thank you Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive Californias wholesale power market Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving and absent of any national policy goals This Commission took a stab at correcting Californias problems utilizing several measures one of which was a price cap Whereas we applaud the Commissions effort we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load We have found that price caps misallocate resources and as your Staff report demonstrates increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists We find that price caps discourage demandside participation and at the level proposed will discourage much needed peaking generation resources We also find that any price cap but especially at the level you have proposed will create unintended consequences For example when market bids exceed sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX such as APX or AlTrade Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates and above which the bilateral market prevails That is a huge hammer a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another WPTF has been against price caps and continues to believe that price caps do much damage and do not protect consumers The damages include prolonging high prices reducing price discovery and reducing the quantity of longterm offers that otherwise would afford consumers muchneeded price protection Average prices do not diminish with caps in fact as you know August prices in California were much higher than last June even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was instead of We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators dont like price spikes and caps are a quick solution If you feel that price caps must be imposed then limit the damage We believe that Commissioner Heberts price cap proposal which starts at and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand or fuel price would be the most harmful Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability On the other hand floating price caps work in the opposite direction They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty and lessen stability If price caps are at all necessary stick to the least damaging approach WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand the imposition of realtime penalties and we support elimination of the mustbuy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation and reduced grid reliability Mandatory prescheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to realtime resolution Also by eliminating the mustbuy provision the UDCs can no longer complain about supply not showing up Their avenues for finding costeffective supply will be unlimited Finally we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems But it is asking too much we think to spare one and eliminate the other The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the wellbeing of the very institution on whose Board they serve We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers but in fact are making a power grab My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect if we have evidence if we detect or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest The California market simply can not survive serving two masters The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders and Thank you

keep you posted Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY Times Staff Writers The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three years ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In the end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists and retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyone from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared off by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that the new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay for a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close to million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself and soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the state in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission and wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at the customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in

Message from Tracey Bradley on Thu Feb To Paul Fox cc Andrea Settanni Jeffrey Watkiss Ronald Carroll Subject DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant FYI Testimony at the court hearing yesterday revealed that the DWR is making the California ISO cover the difference between the realtime power DWR finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to prevent blackouts The purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the states three IOUs two of which are not paying their bills DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California Independent System Operator which runs the states transmission grid against Reliant Energy REI which wants to be allowed not to sell power to California if the state wont guarantee that it will be paid Reliant is concerned that it wont be paid for power being bought by the ISO on the utilities rather than the DWRs behalf Were willing to sell to the DWR but theyre not willing to step up to the plate said Terry Houlihan an attorney with Reliant The DWR has money for short and longterm power purchases It can avoid the situation if it does what the state Legislature said Then there would be no need for a restraining order The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to sell power to California Wednesday then extended the order for another day Wednesday night The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to California in midDecember when the US Department of Energy intervened with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to California on demand That order was extended several times but expired Wednesday Last week the California state Legislature moved to secure the states power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in bonds The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than the utilities While the bill didnt make the department responsible for covering the states power needs the clear message from the governor the Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the utilities couldnt buy on their own That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the states own mounting power bills Maviglio said The DWR has spent million to million a day buying power and has consumed around million since it took over the job in earnest on Jan According to testimony at Wednesdays hearing the DWR has left it to the California ISO to cover the difference between the realtime or emergency electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to keep the lights on The ISO in turn has been billing the states three investorowned utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers In emergency dispatches the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain price said Jim Detmers and operations officer at the California ISO If the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price then it will not procure that power The ISO will be forced to procure it Then the ISO will bill the utility wherever the power is needed The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt service obligations and power bills and have said they would already have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time The volume of power left over by the DWR wasnt known A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that to date the utility is unaware that its being billed for ongoing power purchases Pacific Gas Electric wasnt available for comment The ISO normally bills for power up to days after its delivered The California Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the operations of the ISO dismissed the generators concerns saying they were threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign longterm contracts at high prices The ISO however indicated that credit concerns remain an issue The credit issue is an ongoing problem Detmers said Some generators have indicated they would not supply California because they are not being paid Steve Fleishman an analyst at Merrill Lynch said California needs to take steps to alleviate those concerns In the end there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is willing to pay to backstop this situation Fleishman said Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in letter to Gov Davis Tuesday night Unless an immediate change in direction occurs the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the stage today for a return to creditdriven blackouts in California The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue supplying power to California By Jason Leopold Dow Jones

Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

up to million March Related stories F Electricity notebook F Power penalties repeal expected By KIMBERLY KINDY JOHN HOWARD and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Power producers overcharged Californians by more than a halfbillion dollar s for electricity over a twomonth period according to a study to be release d today by the managers of the states electricity grid During January alone the cost of nearly twothirds of all electricity purchased through the Independent System Operator was found to be excessive the ISO said The ISO the nonprofit agency responsible for buying and selling emergency power for the state said it will ask federal officials today to order the power merchants to grant refunds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December found unjust and unreasonable electricity pricing in California but stopped short of ordering penalties or refunds However the ISO has detailed million i n specific excessive charges and is asking FERC to order refunds disclose da ta about the market and investigate further Although Californias energy market has been deregulated FERC has wide latitude to set price caps if it believes rates are excessive We did some estimates based upon the availability and other consideration s of what the electricity should have cost said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis We found a big discrepancy Power producers said they would forgo extensive comment until the release o f the study However Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents buyers and sellers of energy said The ISO has the right to as k for this review but the costs were what they are People were bidding at the market prices which are legitimate costs in any electrical market in t he nation Accusations of pricing misconduct have swirled around Californias energy crisis but the ISOs study and its filing with FERC today will represent t he first time an agency has said it has evidence of overcharges and then taken action to get money returned It was unclear late Wednesday who would receive any refunds the state th e utilities or individual ratepayers The ISOs Department of Market Analysis alleges that price gouging occurred with as much as million or percent of the energy it bought in December and million or percent of the energy it bought in Januar y Total energy costs for those two months were more than billion compare d with billion for all of Sheffrin said This is a wonderful step for the ISO to take said state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who is on a Senate committee hoping to restructure the electricity market to prevent market manipulation There have been many accusations but none of them have chosen to act The new ISO study looked at power production the prevailing market conditions and the demand for energy and found that the cost of emergency electricity was far higher than it should have been Sheffrin said Further details of the study are expected to be released today Sheffrin said ISO officials have asked the power producers to supply information that would help them determine whether their estimates are accurate but the requests have been denied The power suppliers filed some of the documents to FERC Sheffrin said During December and January power producers had to provide FERC with month ly reports if their charges to the state exceeded thresholds The ISO did not identify the power generators it accuses of improper pricin g Not including the utilities themselves the major power suppliers in California are Reliant Energy Inc of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Mirant Inc of Atlanta Dynegy Inc of Houston and Calpine Corp of S an Jose Also on Wednesday Bloomberg News reported that Gov Gray Davis plans to as k power generators to accept partial payment for power sold to the states

crunch time Greg Lucas Sacramento Bureau Chief WednesdayFebruary Sacramento Gov Gray Davis optimistic assessment that California may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is

popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they want Email Greg Lucas at Copyright SF Chronicle

POINTS How To Raise Electricity Prices ISOStyle By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThere they go again The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high Like past antimarket moves Thursdays request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim Also as with past attempts the ISOs action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co and the states Department of Water Resources The ISO which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the states power grid has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before When the ISO passed a MWh price cap in the summer the cap became a target and caused prices to rise just as the ISO had been warned it would When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from outofstate utilities California generators sold power to the outofstate utilities which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup The latest attempt to suppress the market is mindnumbingly stupid The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices Merchant generators other western utilities and power marketers sold about billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January The ISO says overcharging accounts for million of that total Suppliers prices which the ISO agreed to pay at the time exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than and are therefore unreasonable the grid manager says Actual refunds might greatly exceed million according to the ISO once the FERC looks at the suppliers actual costs Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up for example should be discounted the most Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour What a great idea punish the smart and reward the stupid Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis and Eric Hildebrandt manager of market monitoring spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker In a supplyshort commodity market prices exceed producers costs Where they vary from wellestablished economic principles is that they find this unreasonable Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers including governmentowned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water Power and Canadas BC Hydro and begin hearings on refunds This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the per megawatthour soft price cap above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWh it would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as required But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California or a colluding group of sellers withheld supplies in order to increase prices according to the FERC ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert now chairman applauded the commissions decision to reserve price mitigation for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium

AM To NAEP Team Subject Washington Post OpEd California in the Dark By Lawrence Makovich and Daniel Yergin Friday March Page A The common diagnosis of Californias electric power debacle is wrong The state is not suffering from deregulation Rather it is afflicted by a strange mutant ailment partial deregulation and now partial reregulation that has produced a flawed market California designed a market that disconnected customers from prices and at the same time made it neither profitable nor possible to build a new power plant The result is a serious power shortage Instead of fixing these flaws the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers and businesses And the shortage is going to get worse this summer Under typical weather conditions the state could face as much as a percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand which will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts The effect is likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few years California has made three crucial mistakes since the mids when restructuring of the power industry began The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price signals The socalled wholesale price what utilities pay to generating companies has been decontrolled but the price consumers pay to the utilities has not Consumer prices are remain at levels and Gov Gray Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase Although the price of natural gas which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share of electricity in California has increased dramatically consumers would not know that from their bills Nor would they know that rain and snowfall levels on which California critically depends for hydropower are at low levels As a result the utilities have been in the perverse position of selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying power from generators That is why the utilities are now billion in the hole and teetering on bankruptcy Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of supply and demand and then act accordingly the state is going to use their tax money to advertise conservation But years of experience demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very successful Instead of paying through their bills Californians will be paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up As California drains electricity from its neighbors residents of those states are seeing their power bills go up by percent or more We calculate that if rates in California rose by just percent a third of the shortage could disappear in a matter of months But instead the state has embarked on a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to come The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for capacity Electricity unlike other commodities cannot be stored If there is a shortage of telephone equipment the result is a busy signal frustrating but survivable But when it comes to electric power the equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout and that is unacceptable Thus a wellfunctioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate capacity That includes a reserve of capacity about percent above expected demand to cope with the unexpected whether its a heat wave a sudden surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants In contrast to other states Californias scheme did not provide any incentive for generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and granting permits to new facilities California is one of the most difficult places on earth to build a new power plant The environmental permit process in contrast to other states is complex cumbersome and deeply discouraging to wouldbe investors Companies will spend three or four years to get approval after approval and then find their proposal shot down by yet another local group As a result of all this no major new plants have been built in the state in the past years Meanwhile the California economy grew percent over the past five years In the same time its electricity consumption increased by percent The result was inevitable a shortage California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the power crisis First the state is signing badly designed longterm contracts for electricity in the midst of a shortage California cannot simply finance the crisis forever into the future This summer is likely to generate billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges which now appear likely to be on the states books to be paid over an untold number of years The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires to provide a multibilliondollar cash infusion into the states three biggest utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay The prospect of the state now the largest power purchaser in the market controlling the physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a chilling effect on power investment As a result the state could well end up having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future Third a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure for price caps on wholesale power But even temporary price caps because of uncertainty over their duration and effect would slow rather than encourage new investment Unfortunately the states current plans and proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority The priority need is first to move very quickly to increase supply and reduce demand and to do so now while the coming big shock is still a few months away Second the flaws in the market should be fixed taking advantage of the positive lessons of deregulation from other parts of the country But that wont happen without political will and a surge of realism Lawrence Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and Daniel Yergin chairman are coauthors of Beyond Californias Power Crisis Impact Solutions and Lessons The Washington Post Company

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Weller Andrea PM To cc Fairchild Tracy Subject FW SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION I thought you should all be aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ

accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call if you have any questions Dan

break leaders in the Assembly planned to call back thei r side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a rescue plan for Southern California Edison The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each o f you In short the new plan called for amending SB xx and AB xx to among other things provide for a dedicated rate component to support a billion bond financing by Edison but would have prevented Edison from usin g the funds to pay generators PX and ISO invoices directly or indirectly The billion could be used to pay QFs The dedicated rate component fo r repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years and then apply solely to noncore customers Additionally under the plan the haircuttrust account concept was deleted the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison the RPS targeted a growth in new generating capacity through and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday July an d committee and floor votes on the plan today Friday July However the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week so no informational hearing was held nor will any votes be held today Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week Senator Burtons office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure Accordingly barring the governor calling the legislature back into session we do not expect an y other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August and perhaps not then either Other events this week include In Thursdays Los Angeles Times S David Freeman Governor Davis primary negotiator on the longterm contract deals authored an editorial arguing that the states longterm energy contracts were a primary factor i n the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market You can find the article at wwwlatimescom It ran on the editorial page on Thursday July It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues The amendments are not yet public but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week We will keep you apprised FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges With California still insisting that it is owed billion by generators the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the states expectations Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision In a press statement earlier this week the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all billion adding As for the energy profiteers and pirates let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California If the FERC does not make California whole we will see you in court US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand Californias power grid along Path by attracting private investment to cover the million project He hopes by increasing the transmission capacity by MWs this plan would alleviate the transmission bottleneck that has proved simply insufficient for power t o flow freely throughout the state during times of peak usage According to Senator Dunn Morgan Stanley destroyed key documents years ago relating to the purchase of California power plants despite the financial companys repeated promises to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation that they would turn them over as reported on Monday Meanwhile the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over ke y documents to the committee Reliant Energy sued California on Monday claiming just compensation for the states failure to adequately pay for longterm power contracts that the governor seized from the Power Exchange in February Th e state claims those contracts equal about million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The

Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Douglass Dan Sullivan Harald Jensen Henri Fouda Ikram Elloumi Lee Marc Wolman Marsha Lin Ron Daigle Subject CA Power Crisis Washington Post OpEd Original Message From Kari Paakaula Sent Friday March AM To NAEP Team Subject Washington Post OpEd California in the Dark By Lawrence Makovich and Daniel Yergin Friday March Page A The common diagnosis of Californias electric power debacle is wrong The state is not suffering from deregulation Rather it is afflicted by a strange mutant ailment partial deregulation and now partial reregulation that has produced a flawed market California designed a market that disconnected customers from prices and at the same time made it neither profitable nor possible to build a new power plant The result is a serious power shortage Instead of fixing these flaws the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers and businesses And the shortage is going to get worse this summer Under typical weather conditions the state could face as much as a percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand which will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts The effect is likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few years California has made three crucial mistakes since the mids when restructuring of the power industry began The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price signals The socalled wholesale price what utilities pay to generating companies has been decontrolled but the price consumers pay to the utilities has not Consumer prices are remain at levels and Gov Gray Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase Although the price of natural gas which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share of electricity in California has increased dramatically consumers would not know that from their bills Nor would they know that rain and snowfall levels on which California critically depends for hydropower are at low levels As a result the utilities have been in the perverse position of selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying power from generators That is why the utilities are now billion in the hole and teetering on bankruptcy Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of supply and demand and then act accordingly the state is going to use their tax money to advertise conservation But years of experience demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very successful Instead of paying through their bills Californians will be paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up As California drains electricity from its neighbors residents of those states are seeing their power bills go up by percent or more We calculate that if rates in California rose by just percent a third of the shortage could disappear in a matter of months But instead the state has embarked on a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to come The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for capacity Electricity unlike other commodities cannot be stored If there is a shortage of telephone equipment the result is a busy signal frustrating but survivable But when it comes to electric power the equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout and that is unacceptable Thus a wellfunctioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate capacity That includes a reserve of capacity about percent above expected demand to cope with the unexpected whether its a heat wave a sudden surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants In contrast to other states Californias scheme did not provide any incentive for generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and granting permits to new facilities California is one of the most difficult places on earth to build a new power plant The environmental permit process in contrast to other states is complex cumbersome and deeply discouraging to wouldbe investors Companies will spend three or four years to get approval after approval and then find their proposal shot down by yet another local group As a result of all this no major new plants have been built in the state in the past years Meanwhile the California economy grew percent over the past five years In the same time its electricity consumption increased by percent The result was inevitable a shortage California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the power crisis First the state is signing badly designed longterm contracts for electricity in the midst of a shortage California cannot simply finance the crisis forever into the future This summer is likely to generate billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges which now appear likely to be on the states books to be paid over an untold number of years The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires to provide a multibilliondollar cash infusion into the states three biggest utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay The prospect of the state now the largest power purchaser in the market controlling the physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a chilling effect on power investment As a result the state could well end up having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future Third a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure for price caps on wholesale power But even temporary price caps because of uncertainty over their duration and effect would slow rather than encourage new investment Unfortunately the states current plans and proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority The priority need is first to move very quickly to increase supply and reduce demand and to do so now while the coming big shock is still a few months away Second the flaws in the market should be fixed taking advantage of the positive lessons of deregulation from other parts of the country But that wont happen without political will and a surge of realism Lawrence Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and Daniel Yergin chairman are coauthors of Beyond Californias Power Crisis Impact Solutions and Lessons The Washington Post Company

POINTS How To Raise Electricity Prices ISOStyle By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThere they go again The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high Like past antimarket moves Thursdays request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim Also as with past attempts the ISOs action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co and the states Department of Water Resources The ISO which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the states power grid has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before When the ISO passed a MWh price cap in the summer the cap became a target and caused prices to rise just as the ISO had been warned it would When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from outofstate utilities California generators sold power to the outofstate utilities which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup The latest attempt to suppress the market is mindnumbingly stupid The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices Merchant generators other western utilities and power marketers sold about billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January The ISO says overcharging accounts for million of that total Suppliers prices which the ISO agreed to pay at the time exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than and are therefore unreasonable the grid manager says Actual refunds might greatly exceed million according to the ISO once the FERC looks at the suppliers actual costs Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up for example should be discounted the most Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour What a great idea punish the smart and reward the stupid Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis and Eric Hildebrandt manager of market monitoring spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker In a supplyshort commodity market prices exceed producers costs Where they vary from wellestablished economic principles is that they find this unreasonable Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers including governmentowned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water Power and Canadas BC Hydro and begin hearings on refunds This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the per megawatthour soft price cap above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWh it would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as required But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California or a colluding group of sellers withheld supplies in order to increase prices according to the FERC ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert now chairman applauded the commissions decision to reserve price mitigation for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium

Chronicle Energy Experts Belie Davis Rosy PredictionSummer expected to be crunch time A HREFmailtoGreg Lucas Sacramento Bureau ChiefA Sacramento Gov Gray Davis optimistic assessment that California may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they want Email Greg Lucas at Copyright SF Chronicle

crunch time Greg Lucas Sacramento Bureau Chief WednesdayFebruary Sacramento Gov Gray Davis optimistic assessment that California may be on the back side of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many energy companies and other experts predict Californias real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply increases and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes predictions are that large chunks of the state will be in the dark Were not on the back side of this crisis This problem is far far bigger than the governor is suggesting said Gary Ackerman executive director for the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on the popular notion we dont have an energy crisis We do We have a very serious one thats going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up Ackerman said The Democratic governors comments were made Monday in Washington DC during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street support for his energy plan He admitted more hard work is needed but said the state is on the back side of the crisis because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower electricity prices Does that mean were home free Davis asked yesterday No But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator which oversees the states power market On any given day in June the ISO estimates the state will fall megawatts short of demand That would put nearly million homes in the dark if it happens In July the expected shortage is megawatts In August its megawatts Thats if California has a normal summer If its hotter than normal the shortage grows The ISOs estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis conservation goal But even if a percent reduction were achieved in June that would save roughly megawatts the state would still be short megawatts And there are other variables Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels hydroelectric plants may not be able to run at full bore which would also worsen the situation That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of said Sen Tom McClintock RNorthridge Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will help the state get through this summer The clock is running The ISO predicts shortages of megawatts in May just two months away The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer and I dont think weve made enough progress there said Severin Borenstein director of the University of California Energy Institute California wont be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quickly approving and building new power plants Borenstein said The ISOs demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to come online this summer Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then and now Borenstein said we are going to face some serious shortages Like Davis Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy Unlike Davis he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them an incentive to cut back But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message By telling them the worst is over he could undercut his plan by making people believe more conservation is unnecessary Excluding what lies ahead there are also plenty of energy issues left unresolved right now Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison on purchasing its share of the states transmission system for billion no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas Electric or San Diego Gas Electric Some alternative energy producers like cogeneration plants are shutting down because the cashpoor utilities havent paid them for several months No cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy arent convinced the crisis has passed For starters both companies are owed in excess of million for electricity bought by PGE and Edison but never paid for There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your state will require this summer whether there is enough generation on the ground or available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike in demand said Richard Wheatley a Reliant spokesman Harvey Rosenfield head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over Weve said all along its a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities and the energy companies Rosenfield said Now that taxpayers are paying billion every three weeks to buy electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between billion and billion the companies are happy and the crisis is over What more could they want Email Greg Lucas at Printerfriendly version Email this article to a friend Feedback San Francisco Chronicle PageA Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

up to million March Related stories F Electricity notebook F Power penalties repeal expected By KIMBERLY KINDY JOHN HOWARD and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Power producers overcharged Californians by more than a halfbillion dollar s for electricity over a twomonth period according to a study to be release d today by the managers of the states electricity grid During January alone the cost of nearly twothirds of all electricity purchased through the Independent System Operator was found to be excessive the ISO said The ISO the nonprofit agency responsible for buying and selling emergency power for the state said it will ask federal officials today to order the power merchants to grant refunds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December found unjust and unreasonable electricity pricing in California but stopped short of ordering penalties or refunds However the ISO has detailed million i n specific excessive charges and is asking FERC to order refunds disclose da ta about the market and investigate further Although Californias energy market has been deregulated FERC has wide latitude to set price caps if it believes rates are excessive We did some estimates based upon the availability and other consideration s of what the electricity should have cost said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis We found a big discrepancy Power producers said they would forgo extensive comment until the release o f the study However Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents buyers and sellers of energy said The ISO has the right to as k for this review but the costs were what they are People were bidding at the market prices which are legitimate costs in any electrical market in t he nation Accusations of pricing misconduct have swirled around Californias energy crisis but the ISOs study and its filing with FERC today will represent t he first time an agency has said it has evidence of overcharges and then taken action to get money returned It was unclear late Wednesday who would receive any refunds the state th e utilities or individual ratepayers The ISOs Department of Market Analysis alleges that price gouging occurred with as much as million or percent of the energy it bought in December and million or percent of the energy it bought in Januar y Total energy costs for those two months were more than billion compare d with billion for all of Sheffrin said This is a wonderful step for the ISO to take said state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who is on a Senate committee hoping to restructure the electricity market to prevent market manipulation There have been many accusations but none of them have chosen to act The new ISO study looked at power production the prevailing market conditions and the demand for energy and found that the cost of emergency electricity was far higher than it should have been Sheffrin said Further details of the study are expected to be released today Sheffrin said ISO officials have asked the power producers to supply information that would help them determine whether their estimates are accurate but the requests have been denied The power suppliers filed some of the documents to FERC Sheffrin said During December and January power producers had to provide FERC with month ly reports if their charges to the state exceeded thresholds The ISO did not identify the power generators it accuses of improper pricin g Not including the utilities themselves the major power suppliers in California are Reliant Energy Inc of Houston Duke Energy of Charlotte NC Mirant Inc of Atlanta Dynegy Inc of Houston and Calpine Corp of S an Jose Also on Wednesday Bloomberg News reported that Gov Gray Davis plans to as k power generators to accept partial payment for power sold to the states

Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the states three IOUs two of which are not paying their bills DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California Independent System Operator which runs the states transmission grid against Reliant Energy REI which wants to be allowed not to sell power to California if the state wont guarantee that it will be paid Reliant is concerned that it wont be paid for power being bought by the ISO on the utilities rather than the DWRs behalf Were willing to sell to the DWR but theyre not willing to step up to the plate said Terry Houlihan an attorney with Reliant The DWR has money for short and longterm power purchases It can avoid the situation if it does what the state Legislature said Then there would be no need for a restraining order The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to sell power to California Wednesday then extended the order for another day Wednesday night The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to California in midDecember when the US Department of Energy intervened with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to California on demand That order was extended several times but expired Wednesday Last week the California state Legislature moved to secure the states power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in bonds The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than the utilities While the bill didnt make the department responsible for covering the states power needs the clear message from the governor the Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the utilities couldnt buy on their own That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the states own mounting power bills Maviglio said The DWR has spent million to million a day buying power and has consumed around million since it took over the job in earnest on Jan According to testimony at Wednesdays hearing the DWR has left it to the California ISO to cover the difference between the realtime or emergency electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to keep the lights on The ISO in turn has been billing the states three investorowned utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers In emergency dispatches the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain price said Jim Detmers and operations officer at the California ISO If the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price then it will not procure that power The ISO will be forced to procure it Then the ISO will bill the utility wherever the power is needed The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt service obligations and power bills and have said they would already have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time The volume of power left over by the DWR wasnt known A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that to date the utility is unaware that its being billed for ongoing power purchases Pacific Gas Electric wasnt available for comment The ISO normally bills for power up to days after its delivered The California Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the operations of the ISO dismissed the generators concerns saying they were threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign longterm contracts at high prices The ISO however indicated that credit concerns remain an issue The credit issue is an ongoing problem Detmers said Some generators have indicated they would not supply California because they are not being paid Steve Fleishman an analyst at Merrill Lynch said California needs to take steps to alleviate those concerns In the end there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is willing to pay to backstop this situation Fleishman said Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in letter to Gov Davis Tuesday night Unless an immediate change in direction occurs the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the stage today for a return to creditdriven blackouts in California The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue supplying power to California By Jason Leopold Dow Jones

we are concerned about Also Enron gets a lot of attention I will have this forwarded to the entire team later this morning Thanks Stevan PS Bryson is having a news conference this morning in Sac Will keep you posted Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY Times Staff Writers The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three years ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In the end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists and retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyone from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared off by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that the new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay for a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close to million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself and soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the state in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission and wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at the customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in

demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action

Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Hickok Rob Lamkin Rob Nichol robert berry Roger Pelote Sue Mara Jeff Crowe Dan Douglass cc bcc Subject Draft Comments for Thursday Folks Here is my first draft My time trial shows it takes min and seconds to deliver We need to cut Dan can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies Send me the front end from last weeks filing supporting EPSAs motion Ill take comments up to noon Wednesday gba The Western Power Trading Forum WPTF is a California nonprofit trade association of almost thirty members who sell buy and exchange power throughout the Western US We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week Price caps and their unintended consequences Forward scheduling penalties mandatory mustbuy and Independent Governing Boards First I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer and equally upset by the actions of nonjurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring and drive it into the ground As I listened to your comments last week I took note of all the things you said and the stated purpose of your actions After listening to you and reading the Order I very much wanted to be here today even if it only afforded me a brief minutes of your time I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly And that phrase would be Thank you Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive Californias wholesale power market Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving and absent of any national policy goals This Commission took a stab at correcting Californias problems utilizing several measures one of which was a price cap Whereas we applaud the Commissions effort we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load We have found that price caps misallocate resources and as your Staff report demonstrates increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists We find that price caps discourage demandside participation and at the level proposed will discourage much needed peaking generation resources We also find that any price cap but especially at the level you have proposed will create unintended consequences For example when market bids exceed sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX such as APX or AlTrade Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates and above which the bilateral market prevails That is a huge hammer a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another WPTF has been against price caps and continues to believe that price caps do much damage and do not protect consumers The damages include prolonging high prices reducing price discovery and reducing the quantity of longterm offers that otherwise would afford consumers muchneeded price protection Average prices do not diminish with caps in fact as you know August prices in California were much higher than last June even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was instead of We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators dont like price spikes and caps are a quick solution If you feel that price caps must be imposed then limit the damage We believe that Commissioner Heberts price cap proposal which starts at and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand or fuel price would be the most harmful Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability On the other hand floating price caps work in the opposite direction They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty and lessen stability If price caps are at all necessary stick to the least damaging approach WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand the imposition of realtime penalties and we support elimination of the mustbuy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation and reduced grid reliability Mandatory prescheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to realtime resolution Also by eliminating the mustbuy provision the UDCs can no longer complain about supply not showing up Their avenues for finding costeffective supply will be unlimited Finally we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems But it is asking too much we think to spare one and eliminate the other The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the wellbeing of the very institution on whose Board they serve We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers but in fact are making a power grab My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect if we have evidence if we detect or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest The California market simply can not survive serving two masters The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders and Thank you

keep you posted Deregulation Didnt Foster Competition By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and STEVE BERRY Times Staff Writers The way people scrambled for a stake in Californias power market three years ago youd have thought it was the second coming of the Gold Rush Politicians and free marketers boasted that they were freeing millions of customers from their monopolistic utilities so they could shop for cheaper electricity The state ordered an million publicity campaign promising a brave new energy world bustling with competition But those dreams of capitalism unleashed never materialized dashed by provisions in the deregulation law that effectively undermined competition and gave the utilities a substantial edge over newcomers In the end only of the utilities residential users switched to other providers many opting to pay more for green energy Although the chaos swirling around Californias electricity crisis has chiefly focused on soaring wholesale prices the virtual absence of competition at the consumer level has played a key role in deregulations undoing Had competition among retailers flourished garnering the millions of customers deregulators expected prices might never have reached todays unprecedented peaks and the turmoil might have been tempered economists and retailers say Retail competition would not have prevented a crisis but it would have toned it down said Richard Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which has returned most of its customers to the utilities ranks Now even the prospect of competition is gone A measure enacted by the Legislature last week which made state government the biggest electricity buyer in California suspended further retail competition preventing anyone from underbidding the state That buries us said Tony Wayne president of UtiliSource of Brea which under the new law can keep its relatively small number of customers but is barred from entering into new contracts Few thought it would come to this High Hopes Collide With Reality Almost firms registered with the state to sell electricity to consumers Many of them quickbuck hucksters or smalltime operations were scared off by background checks fingerprinting and the deposit required to enter the market But then there were the likes of giant Enron Corp which predicted that the new market would pull customers from the utilities in the first few weeks Another firm deployed salespeople nabbing residential and business prospects by the thousands They quickly discovered that the structure of Californias landmark deregulation effort erected protective barriers preventing most retailers from beating the prices of the big three utilitiesSouthern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and San Diego Gas Electric For example deregulation law allowed the utilities to keep their million customers until each took the initiative to switch Any ratepayer who used a moderate amount of energy and wanted to change companies had to pay for a new meterunless the retailer wanted to eat the cost itself In contrast Pennsylvania where deregulation has been more successful than in California requires most of its utilities to surrender some of their customers Last year customers of one utility were auctioned off to the retailer who could promise them the most savings All together close to million customers have switched from utilities to retailers with savings estimates ranging from a few dollars to per month In California the next barrier was expressly designed by deregulation architects to keep new retailers at bay at least temporarily Before throwing utilities into a freeforall lawmakers felt obligated to give them time to pay off debts that would hurt their ability to offer competitive prices The Legislature froze customer prices at levels well above what the utilities were then paying for electricity The difference would be used to pay their debts The hitch for prospective retailers was that their customerslike those remaining with utilitieswould be charged the extra amount too That seriously hurt the retailers ability to shave prices for their customers without taking a hit themselves Utility executives say the socalled competition transition charge accomplished its intent providing some protection against new players until the utilities could shed their debt and compete on an even field According to those executives the plan went awry when wholesale electricity prices soared before the special debt charge was lifted and competition had a chance to flourish We havent had enough time for this market to work said Denise Grant director of the Edison division that works with retailers She said Edison expected to lose customers annuallya far cry from what has happened Retailers say they faced other obstacles that seemed designed to help the utilities keep as many of their customers as possible One of the biggest was a newly created energy marketplace called the Power Exchange Under the exchanges rules all buyerslittle guys with a few hundred customers and mammoth utilities with millionspaid the same price for electricity Once again retailers were stymied in their search for ways to cut their customers bills Retailers had no place else to shop for energy because suppliers could make more money selling in high volume to billiondollar utilities on the Power Exchange rather than cutting small deals with upstart companies Wayne the president of UtiliSource learned the hard way He was peddling electricity in California in early before the state created the Power Exchange After arranging a good but informal deal with a Washington generator he sent out hundreds of salespeople took to the road himself and soon cornered customers But the birth of the exchange caused the death of his deal Wayne said The generators pulled out when they realized how much money they could make selling on the open market That was an ohmygod They said Why should we give you a discount when we can sell it to the Power Exchange ourselves he said Retailers say the state protects the utilities in subtler but no less damaging ways That includes billing customers who switch companies for certain overhead costs of their old utilities such as weather forecasters and accountants involved in procuring electricity In late a coalition of retailers filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission arguing that their customers should not be forced to pay costs for utilities they had decided to leave Earlier this month the PUC finally reached a decision that favors the retailers argument but accepts the utilities calculations of the expenses borne by retailers an amount critics say is far too low In dissenting Commissioner Richard A Bilas called the decisions paltry award to retailers another strike against them We cannot keep stymieing retail competition if we are seeking rational markets he said Energy service providers retailers have left the state in droves They need all the encouragement we can give them Retailers Found Little Opportunity Be they multinational giants or kitchentable entrepreneurs retailers are dismayed by their experiences with deregulation Enron spent million trying to sell electricity in and the spring of But unable to offer enticing discounts the firm picked up only customers In a recent meeting with reporters and editors at The Times Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay suggested that the framers of deregulation kept market forces pinned down in the retail sector As a result there was little money to be made and little incentive to stick around The more customers you signed up Lay said the more money you lost Last week Enron returned a number of its remaining electricity contracts to PGE In the end Lay said we couldnt change the rules and we pulled out On the other end of the spectrum Paul Oshideri is now a oneman operation since he laid off his seven employees during his unprofitable two years trying to entice customers to Cucamonga Energy You dont have that many options said Oshideri who is still holding on to his customers and vows not to quit What can you do You cant do anything right now Only when it came to businesses and big institutions such as universities were retailers able to make a dent in the market The small price reductions they offered translated into huge savings for those large users of electricity The retailers also offered a variety of other services including aid to help businesses become more energy efficient Although fewer than of all residential customers have switched to new energy companies of industrial users have done so according to the Public Utilities Commission If theyd structured this differently they would have had households able to make big savings just like industrials said Cal State Fullerton economist Robert Michaels There is some dispute among deregulation critics over whether legislators designed the law to protect the utilities from an onslaught of competition or it just turned out that way Jesse Knight a former member of the Public Utilities Commission who dissented on the panels deregulation plan said the law is biased against retail competition But I dont think it was the legislations intent to protect the monopoly Knight said There is general agreement however that not enough attention was paid to the mechanics of the retail market Much of the deregulation legislation deals with generation transmission and wholesale prices of electricity The only provisions on the retail end simply allow consumers to shop for deals Lay the Enron executive recalled that the utilities fought hard to maintain their customer base The irony is that with wholesale prices skyrocketing over the last six months buying electricity for all those customers has driven the utilities to the brink of insolvency With hindsight I expect they wish theyd agreed to more choice at the customer level Lay said Then maybe they wouldnt be in

Message from Tracey Bradley on Thu Feb To Paul Fox cc Andrea Settanni Jeffrey Watkiss Ronald Carroll Subject DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant FYI Testimony at the court hearing yesterday revealed that the DWR is making the California ISO cover the difference between the realtime power DWR finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to prevent blackouts The purchases by the ISO will then be billed to the states three IOUs two of which are not paying their bills DJ CalifPower Purchases DWR Ducking Its Duty Reliant Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc The issue came up in hearings on a lawsuit filed by the California Independent System Operator which runs the states transmission grid against Reliant Energy REI which wants to be allowed not to sell power to California if the state wont guarantee that it will be paid Reliant is concerned that it wont be paid for power being bought by the ISO on the utilities rather than the DWRs behalf Were willing to sell to the DWR but theyre not willing to step up to the plate said Terry Houlihan an attorney with Reliant The DWR has money for short and longterm power purchases It can avoid the situation if it does what the state Legislature said Then there would be no need for a restraining order The court issued a restraining order Tuesday night requiring Reliant to sell power to California Wednesday then extended the order for another day Wednesday night The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Co and Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison first left generators unwilling to supply power to California in midDecember when the US Department of Energy intervened with an emergency order requiring suppliers to deliver spare power to California on demand That order was extended several times but expired Wednesday Last week the California state Legislature moved to secure the states power supplies by passing a bill authorizing the DWR to enter into contracts to buy power and to finance those purchases by selling billions of dollars in bonds The idea was to shift power purchases to a buyer with better credit than the utilities While the bill didnt make the department responsible for covering the states power needs the clear message from the governor the Legislature and the DWR was that the department would secure the power the utilities couldnt buy on their own That apparent mission might have been altered in the face of the states own mounting power bills Maviglio said The DWR has spent million to million a day buying power and has consumed around million since it took over the job in earnest on Jan According to testimony at Wednesdays hearing the DWR has left it to the California ISO to cover the difference between the realtime or emergency electricity it finds appropriately priced and what the state needs to buy to keep the lights on The ISO in turn has been billing the states three investorowned utilities for power it buys to cover the needs of their customers In emergency dispatches the DWR has not agreed to pay a certain price said Jim Detmers and operations officer at the California ISO If the DWR does not agree that it will pay a certain price then it will not procure that power The ISO will be forced to procure it Then the ISO will bill the utility wherever the power is needed The utilities have together defaulted on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt service obligations and power bills and have said they would already have run out of cash had they paid their bills on time The volume of power left over by the DWR wasnt known A spokesman for Southern California Edison said that to date the utility is unaware that its being billed for ongoing power purchases Pacific Gas Electric wasnt available for comment The ISO normally bills for power up to days after its delivered The California Electricity Oversight Board which oversees the operations of the ISO dismissed the generators concerns saying they were threatening to withhold supply to gain leverage to force the DWR to sign longterm contracts at high prices The ISO however indicated that credit concerns remain an issue The credit issue is an ongoing problem Detmers said Some generators have indicated they would not supply California because they are not being paid Steve Fleishman an analyst at Merrill Lynch said California needs to take steps to alleviate those concerns In the end there has to be a creditworthy party and someone who is willing to pay to backstop this situation Fleishman said Said Reliant President and Chief Operating Officer Joe Bob Perkins in letter to Gov Davis Tuesday night Unless an immediate change in direction occurs the California ISO and the Department of Water Resources have set the stage today for a return to creditdriven blackouts in California The ISO argues that Reliant has contractual obligations to continue supplying power to California By Jason Leopold Dow Jones

Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

up to million March Related stories F Electricity notebook F Power penalties repeal expected By KIMBERLY KINDY JOHN HOWARD and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register Power producers overcharged Californians by more than a halfbillion dollar s for electricity over a twomonth period according to a study to be release d today by the managers of the states electricity grid During January alone the cost of nearly twothirds of all electricity purchased through the Independent System Operator was found to be excessive the ISO said The ISO the nonprofit agency responsible for buying and selling emergency power for the state said it will ask federal officials today to order the power merchants to grant refunds The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December found unjust and unreasonable electricity pricing in California but stopped short of ordering penalties or refunds However the ISO has detailed million i n specific excessive charges and is asking FERC to order refunds disclose da ta about the market and investigate further Although Californias energy market has been deregulated FERC has wide latitude to set price caps if it believes rates are excessive We did some estimates based upon the availability and other consideration s of what the electricity should have cost said Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis We found a big discrepancy Power producers said they would forgo extensive comment until the release o f the study However Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum which represents buyers and sellers of energy said The ISO has the right to as k for this review but the costs were what they are People were bidding at the market prices which are legitimate costs in any electrical market in t he nation Accusations of pricing misconduct have swirled around Californias energy crisis but the ISOs study and its filing with FERC today will represent t he first time an agency has said it has evidence of overcharges and then taken action to get money returned It was unclear late Wednesday who would receive any refunds the state th e utilities or individual ratepayers The ISOs Department of Market Analysis alleges that price gouging occurred with as much as million or percent of the energy it bought in December and million or percent of the energy it bought in Januar y Total energy costs for those two months were more than billion compare d with billion for all of Sheffrin said This is a wonderful step for the ISO to take said state Sen Joe Dunn DSanta Ana who is on a Senate committee hoping to restructure the electricity market to prevent market manipulation There have been many accusations but none of them have chosen to act The new ISO study looked at power production the prevailing market conditions and the demand for energy and found that the cost of emergency electricity was far higher than it should have been Sheffrin said Further details of the study are expected to be released today Sheffrin said ISO officials have asked the power producers to supply information that would help them determine whether their estimates are accurate but the requests have been denied The power suppliers filed some of the documents to FERC Sheffrin said During December and January power producers had to provide FERC with month ly reports if their charges to the state exceeded thresholds The ISO did not identify the power generators

POINTS How To Raise Electricity Prices ISOStyle By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesThere they go again The California Independent System Operator has initiated another attempt to suppress wholesale electricity prices rather than deal with the fundamental reasons of why prices are high Like past antimarket moves Thursdays request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission slash suppliers unpaid invoices for December and January power will fail in its stated aim Also as with past attempts the ISOs action this week will likely result in higher costs for Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison PGE Corp PCG unit Pacific Gas Electric Sempra Energy SRE unit San Diego Gas Electric Co and the states Department of Water Resources The ISO which is responsible for maintaining the balance of power supply and demand on most of the states power grid has suffered the unintended consequences of its actions many times before When the ISO passed a MWh price cap in the summer the cap became a target and caused prices to rise just as the ISO had been warned it would When the ISO exercised its ability to buy power above its cap only from outofstate utilities California generators sold power to the outofstate utilities which in turn sold the power back to California at a markup The latest attempt to suppress the market is mindnumbingly stupid The ISO wants the FERC to order retroactive discounts for power it says was sold at unreasonably high prices Merchant generators other western utilities and power marketers sold about billion worth of bulk power to the ISO in December and January The ISO says overcharging accounts for million of that total Suppliers prices which the ISO agreed to pay at the time exceeded hypothetical generating costs by more than and are therefore unreasonable the grid manager says Actual refunds might greatly exceed million according to the ISO once the FERC looks at the suppliers actual costs Power from a generating company that bought natural gas before the spot market ran up for example should be discounted the most Generators that waited and paid the most for gas would make the bigger profit per megawatt hour What a great idea punish the smart and reward the stupid Staffers lead by Anjali Sheffrin the ISOs director of market analysis and Eric Hildebrandt manager of market monitoring spent a fair amount of time and money to establish this shocker In a supplyshort commodity market prices exceed producers costs Where they vary from wellestablished economic principles is that they find this unreasonable Sheffrin and Hildebrandt want the FERC to obtain extensive cost data from all suppliers including governmentowned utilities Los Angeles Department of Water Power and Canadas BC Hydro and begin hearings on refunds This would cover the vast majority of sales to the ISO during December and January because almost every seller to the ISO exceeded the per megawatthour soft price cap above which transactions must be reported to the FERC for possible review There is no question the ISO has been paying prices that exceed even the already high market prices On Tuesday for example the ISO paid an average price of MWh for power that other western utilities had bought and sold for MWh On that one day the ISO paid almost million for power that was worth about million The reason The ISO has had to pay a premium to the rest of the market since the middle of December when suppliers correctly figured out that the utilities were running out of cash and wouldnt be able to pay their ISO bills Once northwestern utilities stopped selling to the ISO at any price the ISO asked some of the instate generating companies like Williams Cos WMB to step into the middle on its behalf Williams did so for what it has called a reasonable profit Lets say that Williams bought from some other generator at MWh and sold to the ISO at MWh That would be reasonable based on Williams costs according to the ISOs view But if the generator sold directly to the ISO in the first place at MWh it would be ordered to provide a refund because its generating costs are assuredly nowhere near MWh So according to the ISO MWh is reasonable but MWh is too high If the FERC were to order refunds as the ISO has requested no company that generates power would ever again sell to the ISO It would always sell to some third party which in turn would sell the electricity to the ISO at a markup Does the ISO ever stop and think through the impact of what it tries to do We certainly recognize thats a problem and its something FERC needs to grapple with Hildebrandt said in an interview What the FERC will do is save the ISO from itself We reject proposals to return to costbased regulation the FERC said in its Dec California ruling The FERC will review some of the high prices as required But refunds will be ordered only if the FERC finds that a particular seller to California or a colluding group of sellers withheld supplies in order to increase prices according to the FERC ruling But collusion wont likely be found There have been many investigations into whether sellers have created a false scarcity None have found it In December Republican FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert now chairman applauded the commissions decision to reserve price mitigation for real exercises of market power rather than focusing on the price level itself The issue of the ISO and utilities having to pay a creditrisk premium arose after the FERC had decided what it would do about California But according to a source knowledgeable about FERC operations under Heberts leadership the commission will recognize the creditrisk premium as reasonable In the meantime however the specter of retroactive price controls and the increased hassle of dealing with the ISO makes suppliers even more reluctant to sell to the ISO The ISO will have to overcome that reluctance by offering to pay an even higher premium

AM To NAEP Team Subject Washington Post OpEd California in the Dark By Lawrence Makovich and Daniel Yergin Friday March Page A The common diagnosis of Californias electric power debacle is wrong The state is not suffering from deregulation Rather it is afflicted by a strange mutant ailment partial deregulation and now partial reregulation that has produced a flawed market California designed a market that disconnected customers from prices and at the same time made it neither profitable nor possible to build a new power plant The result is a serious power shortage Instead of fixing these flaws the current policies from Sacramento are moving California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices for consumers and businesses And the shortage is going to get worse this summer Under typical weather conditions the state could face as much as a percent shortfall in electric power during summer peak demand which will mean severe emergency conditions and periods of blackouts The effect is likely to be a big shock not only to the economy of California and to the rest of the interconnected West but also to the bruised national economy Unlike other states that have successfully deregulated over the past few years California has made three crucial mistakes since the mids when restructuring of the power industry began The first is the political unwillingness to allow consumers to see real price signals The socalled wholesale price what utilities pay to generating companies has been decontrolled but the price consumers pay to the utilities has not Consumer prices are remain at levels and Gov Gray Davis has promised to hold to his pledge of no rate increase Although the price of natural gas which is used to make a large and rapidly growing share of electricity in California has increased dramatically consumers would not know that from their bills Nor would they know that rain and snowfall levels on which California critically depends for hydropower are at low levels As a result the utilities have been in the perverse position of selling power to their customers at much lower rates than they are buying power from generators That is why the utilities are now billion in the hole and teetering on bankruptcy Instead of letting customers see higher prices that reflect the realities of supply and demand and then act accordingly the state is going to use their tax money to advertise conservation But years of experience demonstrates that promoting conservation without price signals is not very successful Instead of paying through their bills Californians will be paying through their taxes for various measures that will enable politicians to say that they prevented electric power rates from going up As California drains electricity from its neighbors residents of those states are seeing their power bills go up by percent or more We calculate that if rates in California rose by just percent a third of the shortage could disappear in a matter of months But instead the state has embarked on a course of passing higher costs along to consumers in neighboring states and leaving the major bill to be paid by Californians themselves in decades to come The second mistake in California is a failure to charge customers for capacity Electricity unlike other commodities cannot be stored If there is a shortage of telephone equipment the result is a busy signal frustrating but survivable But when it comes to electric power the equivalent of a busy signal is a blackout and that is unacceptable Thus a wellfunctioning power system needs to pay generators to maintain adequate capacity That includes a reserve of capacity about percent above expected demand to cope with the unexpected whether its a heat wave a sudden surge in economic growth or breakdowns in aging power plants In contrast to other states Californias scheme did not provide any incentive for generating companies to add new capacity and maintain that kind of reserve The third mistake is the creation of monumental obstacles to siting and granting permits to new facilities California is one of the most difficult places on earth to build a new power plant The environmental permit process in contrast to other states is complex cumbersome and deeply discouraging to wouldbe investors Companies will spend three or four years to get approval after approval and then find their proposal shot down by yet another local group As a result of all this no major new plants have been built in the state in the past years Meanwhile the California economy grew percent over the past five years In the same time its electricity consumption increased by percent The result was inevitable a shortage California is on the verge of making three more mistakes in dealing with the power crisis First the state is signing badly designed longterm contracts for electricity in the midst of a shortage California cannot simply finance the crisis forever into the future This summer is likely to generate billions of dollars in additional uncollected wholesale power charges which now appear likely to be on the states books to be paid over an untold number of years The second mistake is the plan for a state takeover of the transmission wires to provide a multibilliondollar cash infusion into the states three biggest utilities in order to temporarily hold bankruptcy at bay The prospect of the state now the largest power purchaser in the market controlling the physical infrastructure necessary for market interactions will have a chilling effect on power investment As a result the state could well end up having to assume the role of building new power plants in the future Third a market breakdown this summer would add enormously to the pressure for price caps on wholesale power But even temporary price caps because of uncertainty over their duration and effect would slow rather than encourage new investment Unfortunately the states current plans and proposals divert attention from ways of fixing the problem and have California on the path to an expensive and expansive public power authority The priority need is first to move very quickly to increase supply and reduce demand and to do so now while the coming big shock is still a few months away Second the flaws in the market should be fixed taking advantage of the positive lessons of deregulation from other parts of the country But that wont happen without political will and a surge of realism Lawrence Makovich senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and Daniel Yergin chairman are coauthors of Beyond Californias Power Crisis Impact Solutions and Lessons The Washington Post Company

and Assem Republicans file suit against Gov Davis et al Assembly Republicans led by Assemblymember Tony Strickland held a press conference this morning to announce the filing of a lawsuit against Governor Davis State Controller Kathleen Connell the Department of Water Resources DWR and DWR Director Thomas Hannigan This event was heavily attended by local media mainly television and radio with some print reporters Assembly Republicans present were Assem Phil Wyman Assem Dennis Mountjoy Assem Dave Cogdill Assem Keith Richman Assem John Campbell Also present was Chuck Bell attorney at law representing Assembly Republicans in the suit to obtain the states energy purchase information Strickland distributed copies of letters sent to the Department of General Services DWR State Controller Kathleen Connell and the Department of Finance in the last month These letters were signed by several Assembly Republicans including the newly chosen minority leader Dave Cox and requested the immediate release of all invoices and purchase records on energy purchases made by DWR These letters also requested full disclosure of details of the longterm energy contracts signed by the Governor Also included in this packet were documents filed on behalf of Assembly Republicans in the Superior Court of San Diego in their suit Strickland began his press conference by saying there was a new band Governor Davis and the merchant generators He added on February the Governor said he could solve this problem in minutes by raising rates rates have risen and the problem is not solved Referring to a similar suit by members of the media also filed in San Diego Superior Court Strickland said the Republicans and the press are demanding this information to protect them from the merchant generators He added we had no choice but to legally compel the Governor to release this vital information Assem Phil Wyman said it is not a happy occasion when members of the Legislature have to join with the Association of Broadcasters to get basic information Wyman added that he doesnt have enough information to support certain bills because he doesnt know if there is money available On the subject of Tuesdays decision by the PUC to allow a rate increase Assem Mountjoy said he believes the Governor and the PUC are completely connected adding this is the Governors PUC he pulls the strings there This rate increase will impact all Californians said Assem Keith Richman We will all have to pay for the Governor and the Governors PUCs lack of action last fall when Richman said the Republicans requested a special session to deal with the energy issue Assem John Campbell said he was concerned about making votes in a vacuum adding that it was like asking members of the Legislature to drive down a dark tunnel with the lights offyoure gonna crash When asked who is paying for this lawsuit Assem Strickland said constituents in his district were paying the legal bills Attorney Chuck Bell said members of the media filed their suit last week and were given a May hearing date Bell said we feel that is too far away and that they were seeking a hearing early next week When asked if the plaintiffs would be satisfied with a redacted version of the information being requested Bell responded that AB X statesthat full disclosure is required within days However Bell added that they were waiting for the judges decision as to what the appropriate amount of redaction would be Bell said that the group was confident that case law was in their favor Bell said that Connell was named in the suit because she is in possession of the records we are requesting He also added that the reason for filing the suit in San Diego Superior Court was because he believed it would be expeditious and useful to file in the same court as the lawsuit filed by members of the media The CAUSE Campaign Against Utility Service Exploitation rally was not well attended by local media or the public However the Associated Press did send both a reporter and photographer CAUSE is being coordinated by Burt Wilson a veteran of several consumer activist coalitions Wilson was the only CAUSE member to attended the rally CAUSE is encouraging customers of the three investorowned utilities to dispute the accuracy of their electricity bills by sending the bills to the PUC with a request for a hearing Wilson said the utilities cannot disconnect service if the correct procedure is followed for filing this request CAUSEs campaign is internet based Wilson said we had members when I checked at am today The website wwwutilityratefighterscom contains forms people can use to request a hearing to dispute the accuracy of their bills from PGE Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Megan

Windfall Profit Tax This will be discussed during the cc scheduled for am today Wed Original Message From C Stephen Davis mailto Sent Wednesday April AM To Steven Kelly Cc Douglas K Kerner Subject Proposed Windfall Profit Tax Gentlemen I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electricgenerating industry in retaliation for recent price increases The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carters tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of USC et seq The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress multiplied by the applicable rate I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a base price and current prices to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California California will become the market of last resort Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes and thereby be shifted to other customers The Tax may suffer from legal flaws as well The principal problem is preemption by The Federal Power Act The states are prohibited from regulating wholesale power rates as a direct burden on interstate commerce The proposed charge whether called a windfall profit tax or an excise tax or a sales or use tax or something else is underground rate making There is little or no practical difference between a rate cap and a tax on all revenues measured with reference to a certain price point from the perspective of the interstate electric wholesaler Thus the burden on interstate commerce posed by direct rate regulation and taxing revenues using a price base is comparable The Tax may also constitute an unconstitutiional taking if the price allowed is less than the cost of production and a reasonable return The proposed historical base price will not for example reflect recent fuel price increases Two other potential issues arise as well First the tax has many of the hallmarks of a use tax ie the tax is levied on the purchase of goods from an outofstate provider for delivery to and use in California The gross receipts form the sale of electricity have been exempt from sales and use tax for more than years Rev Tax Code Section While this statute could presumably be amended doing so would be a major policy departure and a big step towards imposing sales tax on utility sales A second concern is the possible impairment of existing contracts as a result of the Legislatures meddling in rate regulation I was unable to identify any instance in which a state imposed a windfall profit tax on electricity sales The forgoing is the product of my conversations last evening with Doug Kerner and a few hours of LEXIS research The issues are complex and could not be much developed in the time available This material is best viewed as informed issue spotting Nevertheless I feel strongly that the proposed Tax can fairly be characterized as rate making Very Truly Yours C Stephen Davis

Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ

special travel deals and news emailemailjspeta Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN uke Energy a powergenerating company accused of overcharging customers millions of dollars during Californias yearold energy crisis has secretly offered Gov Gray Davis a deal that it hopes will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the states chaotic electricity markets The proposed settlement outlined in documents prepared in March by Dukes lawyers calls for an end to various state investigations private lawsuits and state complaints to federal authorities accusing Duke of overcharging In return Duke would make an unspecified appropriate payment but admit no wrongdoing Duke is committed to sharing pain and expediting highlevel confidential discussions that would embrace the governors political and public relations needs according to the documents which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the issue aired publicly Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview in San Francisco yesterday and said he hoped to meet with more generators soon But he insisted that none of the companies would escape a substantial payment because he said they have penalized the state with excessive prices My general approach to the energy companies is that you have already charged the utilities a percent credit penalty for the power they were buying from you Mr Davis said so youre going to have to have a very substantial reduction in what the companies are owed Mr Davis said Duke had walked in with a number of demands including an end to state inquiries but that that was not likely to happen Were not about to call off the dogs said the governor a Democrat who will seek reelection next year Duke based in Charlotte NC is a major investor in Californias wholesale electricity market having spent more than billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside operators in It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of overcharging Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to justify or refund million in disputed charges this year an amount that is thirdhighest among federally regulated companies in the California market By entering secret negotiations with Mr Davis and being the first generator to settle Duke could gain a publicrelations advantage in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by being the first company to open talks with the state governments in the tobaccolitigation wars Weve just simply tried to be part of the solution Richard B Priory Dukes chairman and chief executive said in an interview adding that the company was offering ideas and throwing in suggestions Publicly Mr Davis has disparaged outofstate electricity generators before and after he began talking with them privately In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times he called the generators the biggest snakes on the planet Earth for their pricing practices Californias electricity costs have risen to about billion last year from billion in By some estimates they could approach billion this year for every resident The state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled utilities including Pacific Gas and Electric which is now in bankruptcy court The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of power To pay those bills Mr Davis is seeking the largest municipal bond issue in American history billion although some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will be higher The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the states taxpayers off the hook But how those costs are allocated among ratepayers utilities and generators and whether the bond issue can even succeed remain unanswered questions A major impediment to resolving the electricity crisis according to state officials utility executives and economists is the secrecy surrounding the administrations negotiations Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state On Monday the administration released a page financial analysis including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of state electricity contracts Last week Republicans blocked legislation that Mr Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue The bill could come up for a vote later this week The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations and the agreements that have been reached said Senator Joseph L Dunn a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select committee investigating the price spikes Mr Davis in the interview said there were legitimate commercial reasons for keeping contract terms confidential The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets where the bonds would have to be sold The states credit rating while still solid is slipping Already companies that do business with California like Duke are citing the states creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher prices in their dealing with the state though the state has stepped in as buyer since February The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay million in refunds The companies including Duke Reliant Energy Dynegy Inc and the Williams Company deny any wrongdoing and cite the states credit situation as one reason for the high prices Mr Priory the Duke chairman said that resolution of credit issues would lead his company to drop the socalled credit premium it now charges on power sales As of March Duke was owed more than million by the states power managers documents show In its confidential submission to Mr Davis and his aides Duke said it would forgive an appropriate amount of certain receivables or make an appropriate payment based upon a methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged overcharges The documents do not give an amount but Dukes annual report shows that its wholesale energy division had written off million for power sales to California that had not been collected Even with that writeoff the units profits before taxes doubled from to and quadrupled for the first quarter of this year Dukes preliminary global settlement template of March goes on Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a fair and equitable basis without admitting legal liability because Duke has done nothing illegal Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on the forward markets not the more volatile and higherpriced spot markets But Mr Priory also noted in his interview that at least percent was sold for whatever the market price is On March Dukes lawyer at the request of Mr Daviss legal affairs secretary forwarded to the governors office additional information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power sales in California The documents show that a top Duke priority is the prompt suspension of state investigations lowering of rhetoric and stay of state litigation as well as the withdrawal of staterelated claims at the federal energy commission Also in March the operators of the states power grid told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity prices in California were more than billion above competitive prices over the previous months Duke has questioned the methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by the office of the attorney general William Lockyer and the California Public Utilities Commission Barry P Goode the governors legal affairs secretary says he subsequently referred Dukes lawyer to the attorney generals office The two state agencies say that their inquiries are continuing Sandra Michioku a spokeswoman for Mr Lockyer said Our investigation is ongoing Loretta Lynch the president of the utility commission said in a telephone interview yesterday The public utilities commission has not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and strong The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential treatment for its conciliatory stance Other generators said they were not involved in settlement discussions with Mr Davis nationalDAVIhtmlexDeiD enD cbdddf Visit NYTimescom for complete access to the most

demands nearly billion for electricity overcharges WASHINGTON AP California Gov Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund nearly billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal regulators have looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and other Western states was a step forward But its actions do nothing about the overcharges over the past year he said The governor a Democrat has been criticized by Republicans who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand Davis defended his actions saying the state has stepped up approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation programs He also said the state has little control over price gouging by outofstate power generators The governor once said he could solve Californias problems in minutes But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities putting California taxpayers in jeopardy said Sen Frank Murkowski RAlaska Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities not under FERC jurisdiction Sen Joe Lieberman DConn chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee said the FERC which regulates wholesale electricity sales has been slow to respond and surprisingly reluctant to assure that electricity prices are just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act The agencys response to the Western power problem raises serious questions about whether FERC has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy markets not only in the West but across the rest of the country The federal agency whose commissioners were to testify later in the day imposed limited marketbased price caps on Monday in California and other Western states from Washington to Arizona The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues Months ago the FERC singled out million in alleged overcharges by power generators The power companies have since challenged the agencys findings and the matter remains in dispute To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California complained Davis He said that between May and the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have overcharged California billion They must be required to give us back our money said Davis It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for up to billion The state spent billion for electricity in and billion in and is projected to pay nearly billion this year said Davis Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market he said Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the problem He said newly approved power plants will provide additional megawatts of electricity by including megawatts by the end of this summer Everything that can be done to bring reliable affordable energy to California is being done except wholesale price relief he said This administration has minimized this crisis for more months said Sen Patty Murray DWash alluding to President Bushs repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity prices Bush has strongly opposed price controls although he indicated support for FERCs limited price mitigation effort this week Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that businesses can get lowincome loans and require that FERC press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California but in the Pacific Northwest where electricity prices have also skyrocketed Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price is laughable said Sen Fred Thompson of Tennessee the committees ranking Republican Hard price caps dont work when supply is the problem They make a bad situation worse he said After FERC issued its limited price control order this week Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent costbased price caps on Western electricity sales Democrats in the House however said they would continue to pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action

ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call if you have any questions Dan

Hickok Rob Lamkin Rob Nichol robert berry Roger Pelote Sue Mara Jeff Crowe Dan Douglass cc bcc Subject Draft Comments for Thursday Folks Here is my first draft My time trial shows it takes min and seconds to deliver We need to cut Dan can you send me a front end to this that I will utilize to make copies Send me the front end from last weeks filing supporting EPSAs motion Ill take comments up to noon Wednesday gba The Western Power Trading Forum WPTF is a California nonprofit trade association of almost thirty members who sell buy and exchange power throughout the Western US We are pleased to provide comments on the following areas in response to your Order issued last week Price caps and their unintended consequences Forward scheduling penalties mandatory mustbuy and Independent Governing Boards First I would like to take this opportunity to express our overall gratitude to the Commission for issuing its Order The members of WPTF have been bitterly frustrated by the events of the last summer and equally upset by the actions of nonjurisdictional parties in their attempt to grab the steering wheel of restructuring and drive it into the ground As I listened to your comments last week I took note of all the things you said and the stated purpose of your actions After listening to you and reading the Order I very much wanted to be here today even if it only afforded me a brief minutes of your time I would have flown here from California even if you only allowed me one phrase to be uttered publicly And that phrase would be Thank you Thank you for taking the bold step forward to revive Californias wholesale power market Thank you for having the courage to stand up to parochial interests which are entirely self serving and absent of any national policy goals This Commission took a stab at correcting Californias problems utilizing several measures one of which was a price cap Whereas we applaud the Commissions effort we find that price caps send the wrong signal to both suppliers and load We have found that price caps misallocate resources and as your Staff report demonstrates increases exports of power to other parts of the grid where no caps exists We find that price caps discourage demandside participation and at the level proposed will discourage much needed peaking generation resources We also find that any price cap but especially at the level you have proposed will create unintended consequences For example when market bids exceed sellers will avoid bidding into the ISO or the PX Will the market solution be as simple as bidding instead into a competitive exchange to the PX such as APX or AlTrade Will the liquidity of the bids suddenly flip from one market to another because of an arbitrary line below which the single price auction operates and above which the bilateral market prevails That is a huge hammer a huge movement of tens of millions of dollars moving within the space of an hour from one trading vehicle to another WPTF has been against price caps and continues to believe that price caps do much damage and do not protect consumers The damages include prolonging high prices reducing price discovery and reducing the quantity of longterm offers that otherwise would afford consumers muchneeded price protection Average prices do not diminish with caps in fact as you know August prices in California were much higher than last June even though the buyer price cap imposed by the ISO Governing Board was instead of We recognize that the political reality is such that regulators dont like price spikes and caps are a quick solution If you feel that price caps must be imposed then limit the damage We believe that Commissioner Heberts price cap proposal which starts at and increments upward by specific amounts at specific times would be the least damaging We also believe that a formulaic price cap that moves with respect to demand or fuel price would be the most harmful Market participants can not conduct business with so much uncertainty hanging in the balance The Commission recognized on the matter of Governance that California needs regulatory stability and the Commission is pursuing policy options to regain much needed stability On the other hand floating price caps work in the opposite direction They reek havoc because they inject more uncertainty and lessen stability If price caps are at all necessary stick to the least damaging approach WPTF supports forward scheduling of demand the imposition of realtime penalties and we support elimination of the mustbuy provision embedded in the California PUC Preferred Policy Decision Underscheduling of load has been a practice that has lead to economic dislocation and reduced grid reliability Mandatory prescheduling will get the ISO back on track by prudently limiting the amount of load that can be exposed to realtime resolution Also by eliminating the mustbuy provision the UDCs can no longer complain about supply not showing up Their avenues for finding costeffective supply will be unlimited Finally we support the replacement of the stakeholder boards with independent board members Whereas we have been troubled by the antics of the ISO Governing Board we must note that the PX Governing Board has not had the same type of problems The PX Governing Board has done much better at finding solutions to thorny problems But it is asking too much we think to spare one and eliminate the other The actions of the ISO Governing Board have proven to be highly damaging to the credibility of electric restructuring Other states eschew restructuring after observing the endless debates the layers upon layers of State interference in the workings of the California ISO Governing Board and the leverage exercised by voting blocks of Governors with interests totally removed from the wellbeing of the very institution on whose Board they serve We are concerned that the rules you have laid out for replacing the stakeholder Governing Board may not be enough There may be incredible pressure placed upon the existing Board members to select candidates that further the aims of those that claim to protect consumers but in fact are making a power grab My organization promises the Commission that if we suspect if we have evidence if we detect or otherwise observe actions by a few to undermine the independence of a new Board I can assure you I will be back here raising my voice loudly in protest The California market simply can not survive serving two masters The jurisdictional tug of war must end quickly so that we all can move forward and pursue the goals and ambitions set out by this Commission in Orders and Thank you

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Weller Andrea PM To cc Fairchild Tracy Subject FW SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION I thought you should all be aware that this call is out there Andrea Weller Market Strategist Strategic Energy LLC SENATORS CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATION Senators Joe Lieberman DConn and Jean Carnahan DMo have asked the General Accounting Office GAO to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission the Senators said in a letter to GAO but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation Following is text of the letter April Mr David M Walker Comptroller General of the United States US General Accounting Office G Street NW Washington DC Dear Mr Walker We have been watching with dismay as the state of California suffers sporadic rolling blackouts with impacts on electricity supplies and prices throughout the western United States a situation that may get worse this summer when the demand for electricity increases We understand that there are many factors that have contributed to the current situation and few short term options to create more electricity for this market At the same time we are extremely troubled that Californias Independent System Operator ISO recently asserted that suppliers of electricity in California have allegedly been charging many times more than what it actually costs to generate the electricity an overcharge amounting to billion according to the operator Some experts believe that these high prices reflect a nonfunctioning market that has in turn exacerbated the states electricity shortageWith the possibility of electricity deregulation occurring soon in additional states such as Missouri we are concerned whether there is adequate federal oversight to guard against potential abuse of market power by suppliers Without such oversight the nation may not progress towards achieving what many see as the promise of deregulation lower consumer prices greater reliability increased choice and more efficient generation Deregulation legislation being considered in Missouri would transfer the oversight authority from the Missouri Public Service Commission PSC which works closely with the utilities to provide direction if there are capacity or reliability concerns and sets appropriate customer rates to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC Under federal law FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation FERC Commissioner William Massey recently said Ensuring just and reasonable prices in wholesale markets requires that we clearly define market power and aggressively intervene when the markets are not producing reasonable prices The commissions actions to date have been insufficient March testimony to the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy and Air qualityWe are requesting that the General Accounting Office GAO assess whether FERC is properly exercising its role to enforce reasonable electricity rates Specifically we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fulfilled its mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates Is FERC adequately monitoring and appropriately regulating based on its statutes power supply demand and pricing in California In other Western states In the Central Midwest and in the Northeast Has FERC devoted sufficient resources to carry out its oversight obligations in a timely and effective manner And does FERC have the necessary resources to carry out its future oversight role Does FERC need additional authority to carry out its mission of ensuring just and reasonable prices given that widespread partial deregulation is now occurring in so many states As we understand the situation from some experts the number of transactions in electricity that occur in the deregulated wholesale market place is voluminous This situation may increase the difficulties of guarding against market abuse Is there a role for another agency or independent organization to exercise an oversight role with respect to these transactions If so what would be an appropriate oversight role We have been advised by some experts that greater transparency of prices relating to the buying and selling of electricity in a deregulated market would help guard against market abuses We understand the need to keep prices confidential for a period of time to ensure against collusion After this appropriate period of time has passed would greater transparency be beneficial We are also concerned about recent allegations by the California Public Utility Commission CPUC that market power has been abused in the transmission of natural gas which has in turn contributed to the spiraling cost of electricity generation in the state The CPUC maintains that the price of natural gas transmitted by the El Paso pipeline has been manipulated so that prices in California over the last year have been up to five times the national average Because an increasing number of states including California rely heavily on natural gas fired power plants any manipulation of that commodity can have severe consequences Additionally because such a large percent of our future nationwide generation capacity will use natural gas we are concerned that these types of alleged market abuses will have even more profound effects Therefore we ask GAO to answer the following questions Has FERC fully met its responsibilities to adequately regulate interstate pipelines If not what areas require improvement Is there a continuing role for FERC to play in ensuring equal access to the limited amount of space in our current natural gas pipelines Should this role be enhanced or clarified and if so how Is there the possibility of this same type of alleged abuse in other parts of the country aside from California where the natural gas pipeline capacity is similarly limited Please provide any detailsWe appreciate all the good work that GAO does and we look forward to hearing from you soon SincerelyJ oseph I Lieberman Jean Carnahan

legislation to go to Assembly Energy rate relief bill gets OK State Senate passes rollback legislation to go to Assembly By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER August SACRAMENTO The state Senate approved legislation yesterday that would cut San Diegos soaring electric bills by half and could credit consumers for excess rates paid since June The measure if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor would reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas Electric Co customers were paying in July While customer payments would be cut in half however SDGE ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by power companies The rollbackandreimbursement measure carried by two San Diego Democrats Sen Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis sailed out of the Senate with support from Democrats and four Republicans All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted for the bill The th vote needed for twothirds approval of the urgency measure came from Sen Bill Morrow ROceanside We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so incredibly painful for the people I represent Alpert told the Senate We need your help We need it now San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation legislation enacted four years ago But other areas will be deregulated within two years and legislators do not want soaring rates in their districts A vote on the AlpertDavis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a week because of potential opposition from Republicans Gov Gray Davis who is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June has taken no position on the bill Its important to keep this bill moving along said Morrow who said he struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the construction of new power plants The bill AB would cut rates to the July level and make the reduction retroactive to June of this year State and federal regulatory agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been improperly overcharged In the years ahead San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills but only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can be collected from those responsible Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for overcharging SDGE for failing to make cheaper energy purchases and the state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers I dont think anybody believes anybody is going to be percent responsible for this Alpert said The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug and reduce rates for SDGE customers by half dropping a typical residential bill from the current level of a month to The governors plan is similar to the AlpertDavis bill but its not retroactive to June and would take effect this month Critics of the governors plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an overcharge from generators marketers or SDGE Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network said that what Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction but simply a plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years San Diegans cant afford a pay now and pay later scheme Hoge said They are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis The AlpertDavis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the Assembly Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San Diego Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel support the bill and are listed as coauthors She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans Steve Baldwin of El Cajon Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be heard in committees rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors without public hearings To just ram through a rate rollback a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy shortage he said Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate checks that began going out to SDGE customers this week will solve much of the problem this year He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer The rebate checks are a million refund for overcharges related to deregulation and amount to for the average household An additional million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and September totaling for the typical residence At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation Sen Steve Peace DEl Cajon clashed with Loretta Lynch president of the Public Utilities Commission He said the refund checks only go to residences and small businesses not mediumsized businesses hurt by high rates Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co

Dear all Attached is this weeks legislative report This entire week has been focused on devising a solution for the energy crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget Although the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the budget on Monday the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucia l trailer bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill There are approximately trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budge t bill but have raised concerns for the Republicans SB Transportatio n Funding Shift SB Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs SB Omnibus Health Trailer Bill AB Public Social Services and SB Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill Senate President pro Tempore John Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly As of pm tonight there is no budget deal Meanwhile on the energy front the four proposals we have been discussing all week SB xx Burton SB xx Polanco AB xx Keeley and AB xx Wright are still in play legislatively this evening even thoug h the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly and Senate to stay in session despite the scheduled summer break until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature SB xx Polanco Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES The originally introduced version of SB xx reflected the terms of the origina l Memorandum of Understanding MOU negotiated between Governor Davis and Southern California Edison Edison It was recently amended to reflect Senator Shers proposed Plan B of the MOU a version of the MOU opposed by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy It was heard in the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee o n Wednesday where it failed on a AYES and NOES vote Reconsideration was granted however and the bill passed out of the committee with AYES and NOES on Thursday morning The authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause changing the rate component from KWs to KWs placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section which insulated Edison International from certain claims during the Thursday hearing SB xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday with AYES and NOES SB xx Burton Department of Water Resources electricity bond financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower cheaper rate than allotted in AB x Keeley assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill is signed by Governor Davis The bill also prohibits any additional charge s such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and requires certain sunshine provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the DWR We understand that JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering have advised the governors office that SB xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed The bill was heard by the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a AYES and NOES vote It next must be heard in the Assembly AB xx Keeley Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening on a AYES and NOES vote It was then heard later the same evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee where it was passed on a AYES and NOES vote This is the compromise bill we have been discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred Keeley The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full Assembly possibly later this evening The current version of the bill provides for limited direct access state purchase of Edisons transmission lines for billion a minimum percent haircut for the major generators and a trust to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option AB xx Wright Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of was amended into AB xx by Assembly Member Bill Campbell in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening and the n passed out of committee with AYES and NOES It next must be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee barring a rule waiver No such committee hearing is scheduled at this time Coauthored by Assembly Members Rod Wright Keith Richman Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection among other things Other energyrelated developments this week include SB xx Burton State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NO an d sent to the Assembly This bill provides million from the state General Fund to the California Energy Commission CEC to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals The gran t program will be administered by the CEC in consultation with local governments and will provide percent of the cost of the battery backup system It next must be heard in the Assembly The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday the FERC announced on Friday Despite a Dec FERC order requiring the appointment of a n independent governing board for the ISO the state has refused to follow th e order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the states domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities SB xx Burton Electrical restructuring rates passed out of the full Senate on Thursday with AYES and NOES This bill bars the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC from raising rates back to th e pre percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on March It next must be heard in the Assembly The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies trading practices The resolution SR passed out with AYES and NOES The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texasbased Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents Despite Reliants having handed over documents the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentialit y of Reliants documents The committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents The contempt citation against Reliant will be presented to the full Senate and then immediately sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts Dunn said The states estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from billion to billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment in the states figure on Wednesday Although the state continues to argue that the billion figure is correct FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called th e figure baseless and criticized the California delegation for not negotiating in good faith during the recent settlement discussions The new amount billion does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers two entities that do not fall under the purview of the ISO PX or the state DWR as well as applies FER C price controls imposed June and retroactively takes into account sales from October onward AB xx Migden Electrical restructuring Oversight Board ISO passed out of the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with AYES and NOES It was amended by the author in committee to doublejoin it to SB xx see below This amendment ties the ultimate fate of AB xx to the fate of AB xx unles s the doublejoiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature assuming the bill gets to the governor SB xx Speier Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with AYES and NOES Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author Given the failure of SB xx in committee AB xx is effectively dead as well

Douglass rterHaddencom AM To cc Subject Important Filing Read This Attached is a document that WPTF members should read right away It is a motion whichwas filed by Michael Aguirre supposedly on behalf of UCAN although UCAN is mentioned only in the cover letter and nowhere in the document itself It requests hearings by the Commission to determine the following the cause of the unjust and unreasonable prices being charged for electricity in California the utilities efforts to pursue lawsuits against generators or marketers of electricity and natural gas The motionfurther describes the following scenario which it claims justifies these hearings Five companies operating out of Houston Atlanta and Tulsa have controlled the power to set prices of electricity in California These companies are Williams Energy Services and Williams Gas Pipeline Company and their subsidiaries which operate out of Tulsa Oklahoma and control the electricity generation in Orange County Williams Southern Company Energy and Marketing Southern Energy California an d their affiliated companies which operate out of Atlanta and control electricity generation in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area consisting o f Contra Costa Pittsburg and Potrero Southern Reliant Energy Services Reliant Energy Power Generation and their affiliated companies which operate out of Houston and control electricity generation in parts of Los Angeles County Ventura County and San Bernadin o County consisting of Cool Water Etiwanda Ellwood Mandalay and Ormond Beach Reliant Duke Energy North America and Duke Trading Marketing and their affiliated companies which control electricity generation in parts of the San Francisco Bay area the Central Coast and Ventura and San Diego counties consisting of Oakland Morro Bay Moss Landing and South Bay Sa n Diego Duke and Dynergy Marketing and Trading and its affiliated companies which control electricity in parts of North County San Diego Dynergy These companies will collectively be referred to as the WSRD Cartel The members of the WSRD Cartel are each following the same fatally flawed business plan and each knows the others are following the same business plan The key defect in WSRD Cartels business plan is the impossibilit y of raising and lowering the price at which electricity is sold In order to push through deregulation of electricity in states the WSRD Cartel has lobbied state officials and the public with claims that they intended to us e deregulated electricity rates to lower the prices consumers and businesses were paying for electricity However to raise capital from Americas capital markets the WSRD Cartel members have represented they would be using deregulated generation to raise the prices consumers and businesses were to pay for electricity The Fatal Flaw in WSRDs Business Plan Californias rate payers and utilities are the most recent victims the Fatal Flaw in WSRD Cartels Business Plan Members of the WSRD Cartel along with its other allies in the power and natural gas business successfully lobbi ed California to deregulate electricity In California adopted deregulation and thereafter California utiltiies sold off its control of th e gas driven electricity generation to the WSRD Cartel The members of the WSRD Cartel have collusively and unlawfully used their control of the generation units in Californias to unlawfully raise the cost of electricity to unconscionable levels to amounts greater than four time s the amount electricity sold for before deregulation The WSRD Cartel has used systematic unlawful fraudulent and unfair business practices to rais e the prices to their current excessive levels The WSRD Cartel has withheld electricity from the market in order to drive up prices The WSRD Cartel has used its position of control over natural g as to unlawfully and fraudulently inflate electricity prices by increasing the costs natural gas used to generate electricity The WSRD Cartel members have engaged in collusive practices aimed at shifting large volumes of electricity out of the forward markets and into the real time markets in order to drive up prices The WSRD Cartel members have under bid into the replacement and other ancillary services markets in order to circumvent the price caps and to create out of market calls which resulted in exorbitant and unconscionable prices for electricity As mentioned above UCAN is mentioned in the cover letter but not named in the filing I have written to Michael Shames to confirm whether or not Aguirre was authorized to file this on UCANs

Douglass rterHaddencom AM To cc Subject Important Filing Read This Attached is a document that WPTF members should read right away It is a motion whichwas filed by Michael Aguirre supposedly on behalf of UCAN although UCAN is mentioned only in the cover letter and nowhere in the document itself It requests hearings by the Commission to determine the following the cause of the unjust and unreasonable prices being charged for electricity in California the utilities efforts to pursue lawsuits against generators or marketers of electricity and natural gas The motionfurther describes the following scenario which it claims justifies these hearings Five companies operating out of Houston Atlanta and Tulsa have controlled the power to set prices of electricity in California These companies are Williams Energy Services and Williams Gas Pipeline Company and their subsidiaries which operate out of Tulsa Oklahoma and control the electricity generation in Orange County Williams Southern Company Energy and Marketing Southern Energy California an d their affiliated companies which operate out of Atlanta and control electricity generation in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area consisting o f Contra Costa Pittsburg and Potrero Southern Reliant Energy Services Reliant Energy Power Generation and their affiliated companies which operate out of Houston and control electricity generation in parts of Los Angeles County Ventura County and San Bernadin o County consisting of Cool Water Etiwanda Ellwood Mandalay and Ormond Beach Reliant Duke Energy North America and Duke Trading Marketing and their affiliated companies which control electricity generation in parts of the San Francisco Bay area the Central Coast and Ventura and San Diego counties consisting of Oakland Morro Bay Moss Landing and South Bay Sa n Diego Duke and Dynergy Marketing and Trading and its affiliated companies which control electricity in parts of North County San Diego Dynergy These companies will collectively be referred to as the WSRD Cartel The members of the WSRD Cartel are each following the same fatally flawed business plan and each knows the others are following the same business plan The key defect in WSRD Cartels business plan is the impossibilit y of raising and lowering the price at which electricity is sold In order to push through deregulation of electricity in states the WSRD Cartel has lobbied state officials and the public with claims that they intended to us e deregulated electricity rates to lower the prices consumers and businesses were paying for electricity However to raise capital from Americas capital markets the WSRD Cartel members have represented they would be using deregulated generation to raise the prices consumers and businesses were to pay for electricity The Fatal Flaw in WSRDs Business Plan Californias rate payers and utilities are the most recent victims the Fatal Flaw in WSRD Cartels Business Plan Members of the WSRD Cartel along with its other allies in the power and natural gas business successfully lobbi ed California to deregulate electricity In California adopted deregulation and thereafter California utiltiies sold off its control of th e gas driven electricity generation to the WSRD Cartel The members of the WSRD Cartel have collusively and unlawfully used their control of the generation units in Californias to unlawfully raise the cost of electricity to unconscionable levels to amounts greater than four time s the amount electricity sold for before deregulation The WSRD Cartel has used systematic unlawful fraudulent and unfair business practices to rais e the prices to their current excessive levels The WSRD Cartel has withheld electricity from the market in order to drive up prices The WSRD Cartel has used its position of control over natural g as to unlawfully and fraudulently inflate electricity prices by increasing the costs natural gas used to generate electricity The WSRD Cartel members have engaged in collusive practices aimed at shifting large volumes of electricity out of the forward markets and into the real time markets in order to drive up prices The WSRD Cartel members have under bid into the replacement and other ancillary services markets in order to circumvent the price caps and to create out of market calls which resulted in exorbitant and unconscionable prices for electricity As mentioned above UCAN is mentioned in the cover letter but not named in the filing I have written to Michael Shames to confirm whether or not Aguirre was authorized to file this on UCANs

Friday June PM ET Email this article to a friend Printerfriendly version LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market Duke Energy DUK news msgs Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and Reliant Energy Inc REI news msgs have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power the ability to influence electricity prices in Californias wholesale power market The ISO which manages the states highvoltage transmission system recently made a similar filing against AES Corp AES news msgs and Williams Cos WMB news msgs claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators authority to charge marketbased rates for their power supply Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations Weve obviously just got the filing and were reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing But were also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down Williams said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said the ISOs allegations are nothing new Its similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators Wheatley said The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing Steve Maviglio press secretary to Gov Gray Davis said the governor strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June Dynegys ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy companys production costs The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars retroactive to May of the difference between costbased ratesand the market revenues actually received Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke Reliant and Mirant The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged according to the filing In the filing generators have also been accused of megawattlaundering in which suppliers sell power outofstate that is resold to California at a higher price California consumers have spent billion for wholesale electricity in billion in and could pay as much as billion this year Charles Robinson the ISOs chief counsel said he is

skyrocketing wholesale power prices FERC set up a market mitigation plan which went into effect June to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below Robinson said that plan wasnt good enough Wholesale power prices were at a sevenmonth low Thursday due in part to the new FERC plan cooler temperatures low naturalgas prices and conservation measures energy officials said Every three years FERC reviews generators ability to charge market rates for electricity Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped

sent to the other house for legislative hearings This weeks energy highlights include the following EVENTS Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta Lynch urging that Californias petroleum refineries and ancillary facilities be exempt from rotating outages The basis for the governors letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum products for several weeks The availability of petroleum derived transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of Californians Public safety agencies such as law enforcement emergency medical care responders and the military all rely on these fuels Without petroleum fuels the ability of these essentialuse customers to perform their critical functions would be seriously impaired said Governor Davis Governor Davis along with top executives and business leaders in the state announce a jointDeclaration on Thursday committed to saving percent in overall electricity consumption With more than businesses and organizations statewide this energyconservation coalition sets the following goals among others to reduce energy use set temperatures for occupied space to degrees from May to October reduce lighting levels by percent and an additional percent upon the declaration of a Stage II emergency close blinds and shades when possible and turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay percent of back payments to some alternativeenergy generators The PUC postponed their vote to June on a proposal that would allow alternative generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it from PGE and Edison to remain in business The California State Senate Rules Committee in cooperation with the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further background information in its investigation into whether generators are illegally profiteering from the states

Commission to impose interim price caps until the California power market has stabilized Assembly Joint Resolution AJR specifically states that price caps be put in place at least until California is able to bring new energy supplies online and for the states massive conservation efforts to take effect The resolution asserts that California believes not enough has been done by the FERC to investigate price gouging by generators and control wholesale electricity prices and calls upon the federal regulatory agency to adhere to its governing statutes its vision statement and its own regulations for companies seeking marketbased authority Path study bill passes out of the full Assembly on Tuesday with unanimous support from both sides with AYES and NOES If passed by the Senate AB

from the Governors office Also I have received a couple of calls about whether it is true that Senator Dunn rescheduled the generator hearing this week that had previously been cancelled The rumor is true but it is my understanding that the discussion has been occurring directly between Dunns office and individual lawyers for involved generators so I cant really add anything substantive to the mix OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS PUSHES FOR HOUSE VOTE ON WHOLESALE POWER PRICE RELIEF Oregon Washington State Governors Support Drive for Vote on Price Relief Legislation SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington today urged their Congressional delegations to sign a petition that would force a vote in the US House of Representatives on legislation to provide temporary electricity price relief to the western states I stand with my fellow Californians in the congressional delegation who have so strongly advocated for legislation to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices in our state it is important that that advocacy continue through efforts to discharge HR from the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote Gov Davis in a letter to House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERCWhile we all hope for good results from recent FERC actions we need to be prepared if they come up short If signed by a majority of House members the discharge petition would free price cap legislation from the House Commerce Committee where it has been bottled up for nearly two months Rep Jay Inslee DWash is the sponsor of the petition effort I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERC Gov Davis continued in his letter If the market mitigation scheme implemented by FERC on June fails to rein in wholesale prices it is essential that something stronger be considered After a year of inaction the focus and pressure brought to bear on FERC by Senate and House Members and Western governors resulted in the positive steps that the Commission has taken Governor John Kitzhaber DOre sent a similar letter The exorbitant unlawful prices our utilities have paid to a handful of power marketers have already hit Oregon households and businesses hard Energy supplier suppliers should refund overcharges to all Western utilities not just California utilities that have paid unjust and unreasonable prices for spot wholesale power over the past year Governor Gary Locke DWash also noted that I recognized that the FERCs actions to provide relief for Western consumers is largely due to political pressure from western Governors and Members of Congress I believe we must be prepared to further exert political pressure on the FERC and the Administration should this price cap scheme fail to protect Washington State consumers OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIAS ENERGY HISTORY Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since KERN COUNTY With the flick of a switch Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in Californias energy history by ceremoniously switching on the megawatt Sunrise Power Project in Kern County Sunrise is the first major power plant to come on line in California since We are taking control of our energy destiny Governor Davis said This is the first major power plant built in California since Its clean efficient and it was built in record time The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the power generated at the Sunrise plant to Californias Department of Water Resources under a longterm contract at a reasonable rate By the summer of the plant is expected to produce megawatts Were building more new power plants than at any other time in our history Governor Davis said Next week I will be cutting the ribbon on the megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City It will be the largest gasfired power plant built in California in a generation Over the next two weeks well be bringing a combined total of more than MW on line enough to power the entire city of San Jose In the years before Governor Davis took office not a single major power plant was licensed in California Under Governor Davis leadership California has licensed major power plants and peaker plants Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer The combination of these new power plants with additional renewables distributed generation and rerates of existing power plants will bring more than new megawatts online by the end of September At no other time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under construction and in the pipeline Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December making it operational in a record and a half months The construction force worked hour days six days a week and the plant was brought on days ahead of schedule Because the plant was completed before July it is eligible for more than million in construction incentive payments under the Governors Executive Order D None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison Mission Energy Texaco and a dedicated construction force Governor Davis said I would like to commend Black and Veatch ARB and the State Building and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this project on line ahead of schedule If not for your Herculean efforts we would not be here today

California will get only onethird of the new power that Gov Gray Davis promised to deliver by July virtually ensuring a brutal summer of blackouts for the energystrapped state Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get extra megawatts up and running by summer Instead the state will have megawatts of the promised new power by July according to the California Energy Commission Even by Sept California will have added just megawatts The goal of megawatts enough to power million homes was crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand this summer Were still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as possible said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar But we understand there are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants In fact experts said there are so many obstacles that the governors plan was unrealistic to begin with There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish said Arthur ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets newsletter Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand California can expect a long dark summer Any warm day from May to October it doesnt even have to be abnormally warm California is going to be at risk for blackouts said Michael Zenker director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates an energy and economics consulting firm based in California He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be in the hundreds of hours I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of them pretty quickly The California Independent System Operator which oversees about percent of the states straining grid has said that anytime its load hits megawatts or above California will be at risk of involuntary outages Last summer that mark was reached on days Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily on the weather If its a cool summer California might squeak by with relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts If the mercury rises electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners and the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time This weeks warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear harbinger of a pattern expected all summer Although power plants that were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation the weeks two blackouts tend to indicate that the blackouts well have as we get further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained said Zenker Exacerbating the states inability to generate enough homegrown power is the situation in the Pacific Northwest where drought conditions are severely curtailing hydroelectric production meaning that California cannot count on imports this summer The states next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats shut off their lights and shift their heavy usage to offpeak hours To avoid blackouts in California were going to need conservation said Jim McIntosh director of operations for the ISO Cutting consumption by percent could get megawatts off the grid according to Davis And the Energy Commission says that various measures enacted last September such as incentives for businesses to paint their roofs white reducing their airconditioning needs will save megawatts by June and megawatts by August The governors latest million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional megawatts by summers end But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for cuts in home consumption Thats because the expected rate increases for electricity wont hit until June so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July Psychologically many people will start serious conservation measures only once theyve taken a hit in their pocketbooks Although Californians have already cut back enough to save megawatts during April I dont think more conservation will happen said Michael Shames head of the Utility Consumers Action Network Markets move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns Daviss ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to megawatts In part it relied on three huge power plants Los Medanos Sutter and Sunrise that had already been under construction for years and are certain to come online this summer But much of it was based on getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or build new facilities Those efforts foundered on several issues QFs Davis was counting on getting dozens of socalled qualifying facilities or QFs basically small alternative energy generators to ramp up production That plus restarting of two existing power plants would have added megawatts Instead most QFs will produce only the bare minimum and one of the power plants may not be restarted The QFs which are paid directly by Californias utilities are still owed millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January And a new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission will slash payments for power they generate in the future QFs say they will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they cant recoup their naturalgas costs Peakers Small temporary power plants called peakers accounted for megawatts of Daviss plan Although the Energy Commission sped up licensing for peakers many firms were competing for scarce resources to get the mini power plants built Theres an internal competition among power firms for transmission interconnections for naturalgas pipeline space for turbine parts ODonnell said I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into the peaker plan to begin with Email Carolyn Said at Coming up short How much more power Gov Davis pledged to bring online by July megawatts How much more power the state actually will have by July megawatts How much the state will add by Sept megawatts Projections and reality New

MaraNAEnron on PM Beiser Megan AM To Allen Stevan Fairchild Tracy Manuel Erica Warner Jami cc Subject Sacramento BeeDan Weintraub column Consumer rep envisions ulti mate confrontation Team This is the best synopsis weve seen of Harvey Rosenfields motivations for putting a referendum on the ballot Daniel Weintraub Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation Sacramento Bee May Now that Gov Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats run over the Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to borrow billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases theres probably only one person who can stop him Harvey Rosenfield Rosenfield is the Santa Monicabased consumer advocate who tried to halt Californias experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started His ballot measure failed and that campaign is blamed in some circles for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the electricity shortage thats helped send prices heavenward But if Rosenfields last ballot initiative got the states energy establishment in a snit the one hes contemplating now would positively push them over the edge He is seriously considering launching a signature drive to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his billion energy bond measure That bond to be repaid by ratepayers is supposed to reimburse the states general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for consumers since January when Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison ran out of money The bond measure also will be used to delay the pain of the extremely high prices expected this summer Without it consumers would immediately face another staggering rate increase probably well into triple digits The alternative would be a state budget in shambles All the tax money Davis has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for traditional services such as education roads and health care A referendum that killed the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound and his talk of a referendum may be just that Collecting signatures in less than days which is whats required to qualify the referendum would be a massive undertaking Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than that he will proceed But this is a man who has qualified two measures for the ballot already including one in that brought on regulation of the California insurance industry You have to take him seriously The question is why he would even consider it Why would a man who fancies himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers to swallow a massive rate hike or else bankrupt the state Because Rosenfields goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power system thats now serving California and raking in enormous profits for its owners And if it were up to him hed be willing to risk economic catastrophe to make it happen His theory is that the power generators will simply keep raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on the table It is he says like giving crack to an addict Take that money away and the generators will kick the habit fast If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed and politically or as a matter of economics you cant raise rates that high in the state the only thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say Im taking your plants At which point they will say OK all right were lowering our prices or some facesaving thing will happen The ultimate showdown between naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs And hes convinced that capitalism will blink If the lights go off in California and the economy goes down the tubes then years of Republican ideology of less government free markets competition all of that goes down the tubes All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy people want action and theyll do anything whether its seizing private property or whatever There will be a revolution and I dont think the political institutions in this country are prepared to push things to that point The Legislature already has set a Nov deadline after which the state budget is supposed to be offlimits to Davis powerbuying ways But thats not good enough for Rosenfield By then he thinks Davis will have burned through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total tab will be approaching billion Rates will have to rise again to pay that bill Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation without anesthesia to stop a painful and dangerous infection But he is not the only one thinking about the doomsday scenario The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut deals with the state They have offered to take caps on their profits forgive some of the debt thats owed them anything to keep the system running without further provoking the publics ire They know that Rosenfields kind of anger can be contagious They want to contain it before it spreads The Bees Daniel Weintraub can be reached at or at mailto

represents the opportunity cost of running it now and using up its very limited emission credits rather than running it during the real peak times this summer The represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have had its peaker available The wors is that the stateISO took the bid when there was not dire need just to

Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREMay Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis The accusations are simply not based on fact More importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer If anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to Californias energy shortage said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer Reliant Energy Wholesale Group We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis In fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer We are still waiting on a response Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California disputing the accusation of being obstructionist Reliant Energy has run its toyearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in In Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner Southern California Edison Reliant Energy invested million dollars in alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times In addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum For the last two years Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market In particular Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues In contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor Perkins said Unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year Last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding Perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations When necessary we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights hardly an illegal action To participate

Today with Financial Analysts Summary The host of the teleconference was Mr Joseph Fichera CEO of Saber Partners serving as Governors independent Bond Counsel Mr Ficheras goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to market sometime in June Fichera told me yesterday that he does these calls on an as needed basis There appeared to be some concern that the media is getting ahead of the story and the inference could be made that this is causing problems for the Governors MOU legislation which they also said they hope to have signed by June and perhaps for the emerging Plan B as well A replay of this teleconference is available at wwwenergyinfocagovca Mr Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections California State Senate Pieces of Governors MOU legislation moving in separate committees in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward Assembly Plan B Group Assemblymembers Keeley Dutra and Nation are working together and have good ideas to move the Governors MOU legislation through Fichera said that the Governors office is meeting with both parties but the plan is still in the formative stages He added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the proposal is imminent They are hopeful that it will be moving toward resolution in a week or two Generators Fichera stated that since the Governors meeting with the generators a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governors staff and advisors to resolve the issues He stated that the issue of litigation and investigations by the AGs office is off the table for discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and managing the coming summer QFs Governors team has facilitated days of discussions with SCE and QFs over past two weeks most QFs are represented at these negotiations They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market Their hope is that due to negotiations the QFS will all be fully available to the market this summer PGE They see the bankruptcy judges refusal to allow certain QFs to get out of their contracts as a positive development QFs online There are currently MWs offline this is better than their model anticipated for May They expect more than online by June Last month QF MWs offline Fichera explained that standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June during peaks but that they are allowed to be off during offpeak hours He added that they are still trying to resolve their issues Key aspects of budget plan by this I believe he meant energy financing not the annual budget conservation and contracts Conservation They built in a reduction in demand and reduction for price elasticityconservatively projecting in conservation He stated the we saw conservation in March and April so we think our model is conservative Fichera added that the new electricity rates go out in June and they expect that this will cause a good reaction due to price signals and demand reduction They also built in in natural load growth to their projections as well to further ensure a conservative estimate Energy Costs Projected billion vs actual billion equals a variance of May Energy Costs As of May th right on budget target with a variance of less than a half percent Contracts Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and reduce the net short exposure in the spot market He added that of necessary contracts are not yet executed but rather in the agreement in principal stage He released the following stats Needed executed contracts completed these percentages must refer to projected load accounted for for May for June for July for August When agreements in principle added in for June for July for August Questions from analysts Have you builtin an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of contracts No we do not because we are fighting the optout positions The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to be involved to stop that A few hundred MWs have gone into the market We are aware of this issue which is why were pushing the MOUsthis litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back payment issue would be settled Timing with SDGE where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle We have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations due to other decisions happening simultaneously around us We are resuming face to face negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement There is no drop dead date Generators working group Were discussing DWR credit issues summer support for MOUthe generators have issues with outstanding payments due The Governor expects them to provide haircut re those payments and thats part of discussion QF resolution will gas QFs be released from contracts We dont know what PGE is going to do but they could do that release at any timeno indications yethavent affirmed all the contracts yet We want to avoid this in the SCE situation There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply both utilities We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking for Bond issue timing The current plan assuming there is no further action by the legislature is to close sales days after bond sales on Aug We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period We are making a bridge loan from the General Fund In June we see improved revenue stream from ISO rate increases will also improve cash stream Can you give us any prices on new contracts Not on new contracts we are resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual contracts Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed so far Where is the legislature Legislators want to see sharing of the painso far the focus has been mostly on generators The undercollection is associated so far with the generators legislators are beginning to see that only about of the undercollection is tied to generators So should QFs and commercial banks share the pain Some think some are less guilty than others We can only deal with Edison The media has gotten a little ahead of the process this is going to take longer than a few weeks Handicap Lead horse The Assembly is more organized and focused right now on enhancements and changes to the Governors plan the Senate is not as organized though we have engaged with Senator Burtonwe met with him times this week And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to implement the Governors plan If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from contractshow does this affect your financial plans I think it would change it dramatically It would be a budget busting event Thats why were resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution Does this need to be solved before bond issue The combination of ABx and x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to recover all costs We think that only a few QFs can survive without longterm contracts so its also possible that not all would go into spot market few may be able to survive as merchant generators Windfall profits taxhelpfulness of generatorsdid they perform adequately during summer of What are your expectations of their performance The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mindhe left that open as to how hell evaluate their performance People at DWR and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this matter Bond issue timing We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell bonds by end of June if stars are alignedit may be one megadeal or several tronches spthis is still open for discussion Even with the rising prices that we expect this summer most of our net short will be under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we dont expect our budget to be busted Extended bridge financing commitmentirrelevant because we dont have authority to issue for days Renewable QFsgas pricesis there anything can you dolevelize gas prices so they can operate under Srack sp price formula Many options have been discussed to bring them into the market we need such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be worked out Polanco MOU legislation is it identical to the Governors view or already changed This is the implementing legislation for the Governors MOUnot changed so far Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that could be changed He went on to explain that anything taken out must be replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced This is going to take some time however we do have a sense of urgencywe are hoping for a vote sometime in June The MOU has deadline of August Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide

Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM smara Sent by PM To smara cc Subject SF Gate Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Wednesday June SF Chronicle Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest level in more than a year partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices for natural gas which fuels most power plants Make no mistake Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead But for the first time since Californias energy markets went haywire last summer industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs California is not yet out of the woods said Kelley Doolan who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts But this is a very significant decrease in costs Along with lower gas prices the decline in electricity costs was attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather which reduces demand for power They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and betterthanexpected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association said these factors came together to produce the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as little as per megawatt hour he noted compared with more than earlier this year If the weather stays this way we could have reasonable prices all summer Ackerman said We may also have fewer blackouts It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in energy prices If power companies manipulated prices on the way up as critics have alleged might they not be up to some trick as prices head in the opposite direction Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in the dysfunctional California market Theyre trying to take the heat off she said Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistical blip This was just one months decline said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego We really have to see how this plays out in the future Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor was very encouraged by the lower energy prices Davis announced Sunday that Californias power use was down percent last month from a year before Were not there yet Maviglio said of whether an end to the states power woes is in sight But the trend is pointing in the right direction WHITE ELEPHANT Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side California could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about billion in public funds on longterm power contracts The logic behind the contracts which are at an average price of per megawatt hour over years is that the state expected to pay belowmarket rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and California found itself paying abovemarket rates If current trends continue though California will find itself paying consistently abovemarket rates much sooner than expected making the long term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so handsomely during the states darkest hours The contracts look really ugly right now said Shames at the Utility Consumers Action Network They may be way overpriced Maviglio the governors spokesman said it is too early to conclude that the state did poorly negotiating dozens of longterm power contracts No one has a crystal ball on this he said CUSTOMERS BILLS TO DROP In any case Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that customers average gas bills will drop percent this month to and should stay near that level all summer Platts which monitors average monthly spot prices found that the wholesale price of gas at the CaliforniaOregon border has tumbled nearly percent since the beginning of May from per million British thermal units to The wholesale gas price at the CaliforniaArizona border fell percent from to This compares with a percent monthly decline in average natural gas prices nationwide However California gas prices are still about percent higher than they were a year ago whereas national prices are now below yearago levels for the first time since last spring While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer he said That created enormous demand for electricity generation What has changed is that weve had weeks of mild weather Doolan observed The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas This allowed utilities like PGE to beef up gas inventories which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices he said BACK ON TRACK Were back on track to be completely full for winter said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Thats a very good thing Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter PGE is forecasting that customers average gas bills could rise to as high as in December if current trends continue However the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that Californias unusually high costs at last may be abating Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Mercantile Exchange SUBJECT Hertzberg Edison new proposal is de ja vu all over a gain When it comes to having nerve SoCal Edison takes second to no one The latest rescue proposal announced by Speaker Hertzberg has a familiar ri ng to it like the dinner bell at the shark tank at Sea World The Hertzberg memo and a Dow Jones story are included in this memo A summary of the primary terms of HertzbergEdisons plan is as follows o Large users of electricity kw and up would have dir ect access after two years o Residential and small businesses would be reregulated o The ransom for direct access is that businesses would be required to retire Edisons billion or so in debtand that the obligation would follow them to the land of direct access Does anything sound familiar here hintthink AB without the surplu s budget and electricity of Remember the CPUC action and A B SCE was a very active and influential player in that process Here s a short review of AB o Direct access would be allowed projected to be about after the utilities stranded costs were retired Note At the time of the bankruptcy of the PX in March direct access was not just elusiveit had been banned by the passage of AB X in January o The state created California Power Exchange was mandatory for the utilitiesthough by they began urgently to use alternatives they w ere refused on at least four occasions by CPUC action to use sources outside t he PX o Stranded costs determined inside the PX pricing mechanism were applied to all transactions that occurred outside the PX thus the obligati on followed those seeking an alternative market to the PX o The mandatory PX forced the market into a dayahead pricing schem e that effective placed the vast majority of California electricity pricing into the volatile spot market If this were not California one would have to say that this is unbelievable but the legislativeregulatory track record since in California is consistent if anything Adoption of this plan would not onl y mean that Californians did not get the baby direct access after payin g the ransom the Competition Transition Charge CTC since BUT they ve been taken hostage themselves now and another ransom is due California Kafkaesque Since the beginning of the deregulatory process in California has taken a novel approach to its energy marketsUnfortunately that novel must have been written by Franz Kafka HertzbergEdison Plan A Fair Plan for California Assembly Democratic Caucus What the California public believes about the energy crisis Utilities are to blame Outofstate generators have made huge profits We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand Deregulation is a failure The economy of the state is at risk What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis Reregulation restore balance to system Very small if any rate increases Reliability of supply no more blackouts No permanent damage to environment more emphasis on renewable sources Penalties for

Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates Restore regulated utilities to creditworthiness to enable them to resume role of energy supplier Ensure that megausers of electricity have direct

service for all residential and small business consumers Provides direct access to providers for megausers above kW Megausers pay DRC to cover SCE debt Added elements to the MOU Transmission option at book value Federal tax refund must be applied to debt SCE purchases net short only for residences and small businesses if necessary PUC retains jurisdiction over rates EIX provides assurance to keep

existing PUC rates Dow Jones Story LOS ANGELES Dow JonesA plan that would put most of the burden of rescui ng embattled Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison on lar ge businesses has possibilities if it can gain stakeholder approval said Bo b Foster Edisons senior vice president of public affairs during a conferen ce call Tuesday The plan would have customers who use more than kilowatthours a month of electricity finance the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased on its behalf in the wholesale market The noncore customers would also help the utility recoup most of its billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the lowcost power the utility generates itself or has secured through longterm contracts Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys strongly supports the plan and has asked a former Sacramento mayor to help him take the temperature of Edison stakeholders to see if the approach has merit or can be acceptable Foste r said Some of the legislative leadership believes this is an attractive option i n both houses Foster said Business groups worry that the plan could cost the state billions in lost economic activity because it may force companies to relocate to other stat es The corenoncore proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers a s alternatives to a memorandum of understanding reached between Edison and Go v Gray Davis in April The MOU which would have the state buy the utilitys transmission lines has been pronounced dead by many in the legislature though Edison and Davis administration say they are still devoted to seeing it through

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS PUSHES FOR HOUSE VOTE ON WHOLESALE POWER PRICE RELIEF Oregon Washington State Governors Support Drive for Vote on Price Relief Legislation SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington today urged their Congressional delegations to sign a petition that would force a vote in the US House of Representatives on legislation to provide temporary electricity price relief to the western states I stand with my fellow Californians in the congressional delegation who have so strongly advocated for legislation to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices in our state it is important that that advocacy continue through efforts to discharge HR from the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote Gov Davis in a letter to House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERCWhile we all hope for good results from recent FERC actions we need to be prepared if they come up short If signed by a majority of House members the discharge petition would free price cap legislation from the House Commerce Committee where it has been bottled up for nearly two months Rep Jay Inslee DWash is the sponsor of the petition effort I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERC Gov Davis continued in his letter If the market mitigation scheme implemented by FERC on June fails to rein in wholesale prices it is essential that something stronger be considered After a year of inaction the focus and pressure brought to bear on FERC by Senate and House Members and Western governors resulted in the positive steps that the Commission has taken Governor John Kitzhaber DOre sent a similar letter The exorbitant unlawful prices our utilities have paid to a handful of power marketers have already hit Oregon households and businesses hard Energy supplier suppliers should refund overcharges to all Western utilities not just California utilities that have paid unjust and unreasonable prices for spot wholesale power over the past year Governor Gary Locke DWash also noted that I recognized that the FERCs actions to provide relief for Western consumers is largely due to political pressure from western Governors and Members of Congress I believe we must be prepared to further exert political pressure on the FERC and the Administration should this price cap scheme fail to protect Washington State consumers OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIAS ENERGY HISTORY Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since KERN COUNTY With the flick of a switch Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in Californias energy history by ceremoniously switching on the megawatt Sunrise Power Project in Kern County Sunrise is the first major power plant to come on line in California since We are taking control of our energy destiny Governor Davis said This is the first major power plant built in California since Its clean efficient and it was built in record time The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the power generated at the Sunrise plant to Californias Department of Water Resources under a longterm contract at a reasonable rate By the summer of the plant is expected to produce megawatts Were building more new power plants than at any other time in our history Governor Davis said Next week I will be cutting the ribbon on the megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City It will be the largest gasfired power plant built in California in a generation Over the next two weeks well be bringing a combined total of more than MW on line enough to power the entire city of San Jose In the years before Governor Davis took office not a single major power plant was licensed in California Under Governor Davis leadership California has licensed major power plants and peaker plants Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer The combination of these new power plants with additional renewables distributed generation and rerates of existing power plants will bring more than new megawatts online by the end of September At no other time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under construction and in the pipeline Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December making it operational in a record and a half months The construction force worked hour days six days a week and the plant was brought on days ahead of schedule Because the plant was completed before July it is eligible for more than million in construction incentive payments under the Governors Executive Order D None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison Mission Energy Texaco and a dedicated construction force Governor Davis said I would like to commend Black and Veatch ARB and the State Building and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this project on line ahead of schedule If not for your Herculean efforts we would not be here today

cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Wednesday May SF Chronicle Its bad and itll get worseTROUBLE AHEAD Extra power for summer will fall well short of Gov Davis promise Carolyn Said Chronicle Staff Writer California will get only onethird of the new power that Gov Gray Davis promised to deliver by July virtually ensuring a brutal summer of blackouts for the energystrapped state Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get extra megawatts up and running by summer Instead the state will have megawatts of the promised new power by July according to the California Energy Commission Even by Sept California will have added just megawatts The goal of megawatts enough to power million homes was crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand this summer Were still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as possible said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar But we understand there are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants In fact experts said there are so many obstacles that the governors plan was unrealistic to begin with There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish said Arthur ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets newsletter Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand California can expect a long dark summer Any warm day from May to October it doesnt even have to be abnormally warm California is going to be at risk for blackouts said Michael Zenker director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates an energy and economics consulting firm based in California He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be in the hundreds of hours I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of them pretty quickly The California Independent System Operator which oversees about percent of the states straining grid has said that anytime its load hits megawatts or above California will be at risk of involuntary outages Last summer that mark was reached on days Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily on the weather If its a cool summer California might squeak by with relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts If the mercury rises electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners and the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time This weeks warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear harbinger of a pattern expected all summer Although power plants that were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation the weeks two blackouts tend to indicate that the blackouts well have as we get further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained said Zenker Exacerbating the states inability to generate enough homegrown power is the situation in the Pacific Northwest where drought conditions are severely curtailing hydroelectric production meaning that California cannot count on imports this summer The states next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats shut off their lights and shift their heavy usage to offpeak hours To avoid blackouts in California were going to need conservation said Jim McIntosh director of operations for the ISO Cutting consumption by percent could get megawatts off the grid according to Davis And the Energy Commission says that various measures enacted last September such as incentives for businesses to paint their roofs white reducing their airconditioning needs will save megawatts by June and megawatts by August The governors latest million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional megawatts by summers end But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for cuts in home consumption Thats because the expected rate increases for electricity wont hit until June so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July Psychologically many people will start serious conservation measures only once theyve taken a hit in their pocketbooks Although Californians have already cut back enough to save megawatts during April I dont think more conservation will happen said Michael Shames head of the Utility Consumers Action Network Markets move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns Daviss ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to megawatts In part it relied on three huge power plants Los Medanos Sutter and Sunrise that had already been under construction for years and are certain to come online this summer But much of it was based on getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or build new facilities Those efforts foundered on several issues QFs Davis was counting on getting dozens of socalled qualifying facilities or QFs basically small alternative energy generators to ramp up production That plus restarting of two existing power plants would have added megawatts Instead most QFs will produce only the bare minimum and one of the power plants may not be restarted The QFs which are paid directly by Californias utilities are still owed millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January And a new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission will slash payments for power they generate in the future QFs say they will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they cant recoup their naturalgas costs Peakers Small temporary power plants called peakers accounted for megawatts of Daviss plan Although the Energy Commission sped up licensing for peakers many firms were competing for scarce resources to get the mini power plants built Theres an internal competition among power firms for transmission interconnections for naturalgas pipeline space for turbine parts ODonnell said I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into the peaker plan to begin with Email Carolyn Said at Coming up short How much more

MaraNAEnron on PM Beiser Megan AM To Allen Stevan Fairchild Tracy Manuel Erica Warner Jami cc Subject Sacramento BeeDan Weintraub column Consumer rep envisions ulti mate confrontation Team This is the best synopsis weve seen of Harvey Rosenfields motivations for putting a referendum on the ballot Daniel Weintraub Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation Sacramento Bee May Now that Gov Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats run over the Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to borrow billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases theres probably only one person who can stop him Harvey Rosenfield Rosenfield is the Santa Monicabased consumer advocate who tried to halt Californias experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started His ballot measure failed and that campaign is blamed in some circles for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the electricity shortage thats helped send prices heavenward But if Rosenfields last ballot initiative got the states energy establishment in a snit the one hes contemplating now would positively push them over the edge He is seriously considering launching a signature drive to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his billion energy bond measure That bond to be repaid by ratepayers is supposed to reimburse the states general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for consumers since January when Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison ran out of money The bond measure also will be used to delay the pain of the extremely high prices expected this summer Without it consumers would immediately face another staggering rate increase probably well into triple digits The alternative would be a state budget in shambles All the tax money Davis has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for traditional services such as education roads and health care A referendum that killed the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound and his talk of a referendum may be just that Collecting signatures in less than days which is whats required to qualify the referendum would be a massive undertaking Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than that he will proceed But this is a man who has qualified two measures for the ballot already including one in that brought on regulation of the California insurance industry You have to take him seriously The question is why he would even consider it Why would a man who fancies himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers to swallow a massive rate hike or else bankrupt the state Because Rosenfields goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power system thats now serving California and raking in enormous profits for its owners And if it were up to him hed be willing to risk economic catastrophe to make it happen His theory is that the power generators will simply keep raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on the table It is he says like giving crack to an addict Take that money away and the generators will kick the habit fast If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed and politically or as a matter of economics you cant raise rates that high in the state the only thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say Im taking your plants At which point they will say OK all right were lowering our prices or some facesaving thing will happen The ultimate showdown between naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs And hes convinced that capitalism will blink If the lights go off in California and the economy goes down the tubes then years of Republican ideology of less government free markets competition all of that goes down the tubes All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy people want action and theyll do anything whether its seizing private property or whatever There will be a revolution and I dont think the political institutions in this country are prepared to push things to that point The Legislature already has set a Nov deadline after which the state budget is supposed to be offlimits to Davis powerbuying ways But thats not good enough for Rosenfield By then he thinks Davis will have burned through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total tab will be approaching billion Rates will have to rise again to pay that bill Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation without anesthesia to stop a painful and dangerous infection But he is not the only one thinking about the doomsday scenario The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut deals with the state They have offered to take caps on their profits forgive some of the debt thats owed them anything to keep the system running without further provoking the publics ire They know that Rosenfields kind of anger can be contagious They want to contain it before it spreads The Bees Daniel Weintraub can be reached at or at mailto

Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREMay Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis The accusations are simply not based on fact More importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer If anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to Californias energy shortage said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer Reliant Energy Wholesale Group We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis In fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer We are still waiting on a response Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California disputing the accusation of being obstructionist Reliant Energy has run its toyearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in In Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner Southern California Edison Reliant Energy invested million dollars in alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times In addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum For the last two years Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market In particular Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues In contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor Perkins said Unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year Last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding Perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations When necessary we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights hardly an illegal action To participate

Email Robert Morgan Email Sue Mara Email cc Subject Governor Davis Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today wi th Financial Analysts Summary Governor Davis Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today with Financial Analysts Summary The host of the teleconference was Mr Joseph Fichera CEO of Saber Partners serving as Governors independent Bond Counsel Mr Ficheras goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to market sometime in June Fichera told me yesterday that he does these calls on an as needed basis There appeared to be some concern that the media is getting ahead of the story and the inference could be made that this is causing problems for the Governors MOU legislation which they also said they hope to have signed by June and perhaps for the emerging Plan B as well A replay of this teleconference is available at wwwenergyinfocagovca Mr Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections California State Senate Pieces of Governors MOU legislation moving in separate committees in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward Assembly Plan B Group Assemblymembers Keeley Dutra and Nation are working together and have good ideas to move the Governors MOU legislation through Fichera said that the Governors office is meeting with both parties but the plan is still in the formative stages He added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the proposal is imminent They are hopeful that it will be moving toward resolution in a week or two Generators Fichera stated that since the Governors meeting with the generators a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governors staff and advisors to resolve the issues He stated that the issue of litigation and investigations by the AGs office is off the table for discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and managing the coming summer QFs Governors team has facilitated days of discussions with SCE and QFs over past two weeks most QFs are represented at these negotiations They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market Their hope is that due to negotiations the QFS will all be fully available to the market this summer PGE They see the bankruptcy judges refusal to allow certain QFs to get out of their contracts as a positive development QFs online There are currently MWs offline this is better than their model anticipated for May They expect more than online by June Last month QF MWs offline Fichera explained that standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June during peaks but that they are allowed to be off during offpeak hours He added that they are still trying to resolve their issues Key aspects of budget plan by this I believe he meant energy financing not the annual budget conservation and contracts Conservation They built in a reduction in demand and reduction for price elasticityconservatively projecting in conservation He stated the we saw conservation in March and April so we think our model is conservative Fichera added that the new electricity rates go out in June and they expect that this will cause a good reaction due to price signals and demand reduction They also built in in natural load growth to their projections as well to further ensure a conservative estimate Energy Costs Projected billion vs actual billion equals a variance of May Energy Costs As of May th right on budget target with a variance of less than a half percent Contracts Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and reduce the net short exposure in the spot market He added that of necessary contracts are not yet executed but rather in the agreement in principal stage He released the following stats Needed executed contracts completed these percentages must refer to projected load accounted for for May for June for July for August When agreements in principle added in for June for July for August Questions from analysts Have you builtin an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of contracts No we do not because we are fighting the optout positions The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to be involved to stop that A few hundred MWs have gone into the market We are aware of this issue which is why were pushing the MOUsthis litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back payment issue would be settled Timing with SDGE where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle We have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations due to other decisions happening simultaneously around us We are resuming face to face negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement There is no drop dead date Generators working group Were discussing DWR credit issues summer support for MOUthe generators have issues with outstanding payments due The Governor expects them to provide haircut re those payments and thats part of discussion QF resolution will gas QFs be released from contracts We dont know what PGE is going to do but they could do that release at any timeno indications yethavent affirmed all the contracts yet We want to avoid this in the SCE situation There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply both utilities We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking for Bond issue timing The current plan assuming there is no further action by the legislature is to close sales days after bond sales on Aug We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period We are making a bridge loan from the General Fund In June we see improved revenue stream from ISO rate increases will also improve cash stream Can you give us any prices on new contracts Not on new contracts we are resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual contracts Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed so far Where is the legislature Legislators want to see sharing of the painso far the focus has been mostly on generators The undercollection is associated so far with the generators legislators are beginning to see that only about of the undercollection is tied to generators So should QFs and commercial banks share the pain Some think some are less guilty than others We can only deal with Edison The media has gotten a little ahead of the process this is going to take longer than a few weeks Handicap Lead horse The Assembly is more organized and focused right now on enhancements and changes to the Governors plan the Senate is not as organized though we have engaged with Senator Burtonwe met with him times this week And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to implement the Governors plan If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from contractshow does this affect your financial plans I think it would change it dramatically It would be a budget busting event Thats why were resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution Does this need to be solved before bond issue The combination of ABx and x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to recover all costs We think that only a few QFs can survive without longterm contracts so its also possible that not all would go into spot market few may be able to survive as merchant generators Windfall profits taxhelpfulness of generatorsdid they perform adequately during summer of What are your expectations of their performance The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mindhe left that open as to how hell evaluate their performance People at DWR and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this matter Bond issue timing We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell bonds by end of June if stars are alignedit may be one megadeal or several tronches spthis is still open for discussion Even with the rising prices that we expect this summer most of our net short will be under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we dont expect our budget to be busted Extended bridge financing commitmentirrelevant because we dont have authority to issue for days Renewable QFsgas pricesis there anything can you dolevelize gas prices so they can operate under Srack sp price formula Many options have been discussed to bring them into the market we need such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be worked out Polanco MOU legislation is it identical to the Governors view or already changed This is the implementing legislation for the Governors MOUnot changed so far Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that could be changed He went on to explain that anything taken out must be replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced This is going to take some time however we do have a sense of urgencywe are hoping for a vote sometime in June The MOU has deadline of August Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide

Friday June PM ET Email this article to a friend Printerfriendly version LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market Duke Energy DUK news msgs Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and Reliant Energy Inc REI news msgs have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power the ability to influence electricity prices in Californias wholesale power market The ISO which manages the states highvoltage transmission system recently made a similar filing against AES Corp AES news msgs and Williams Cos WMB news msgs claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators authority to charge marketbased rates for their power supply Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations Weve obviously just got the filing and were reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing But were also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down Williams said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said the ISOs allegations are nothing new Its similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators Wheatley said The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing Steve Maviglio press secretary to Gov Gray Davis said the governor strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June Dynegys ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy companys production costs The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars retroactive to May of the difference between costbased ratesand the market revenues actually received Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke Reliant and Mirant The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged according to the filing In the filing generators have also been accused of megawattlaundering in which suppliers sell power outofstate that is resold to California at a higher price California consumers have spent billion for wholesale electricity in billion in and could pay as much as billion this year Charles Robinson the ISOs chief counsel said he is optimistic the state will prevail in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief were seeking He said FERC should implement an effective market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices FERC set up a market mitigation plan which went into effect June to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below Robinson said that plan wasnt good enough Wholesale power prices were at a sevenmonth low Thursday due in part to the new FERC plan cooler temperatures low naturalgas prices and conservation measures energy officials said Every three years FERC reviews generators ability to charge market rates for electricity Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices

centered around the budget conference committee hearing as the deadline to pass the states budget is next Friday June th Also today was the last day for bills to pass out of their house of origin and sent to the other house for legislative hearings This weeks energy highlights include the following EVENTS Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta Lynch urging that Californias petroleum refineries and ancillary facilities be exempt from rotating outages The basis for the governors letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum products for several weeks The availability of petroleum derived transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of Californians Public safety agencies such as law enforcement emergency medical care responders and the military all rely on these fuels Without petroleum fuels the ability of these essentialuse customers to perform their critical functions would be seriously impaired said Governor Davis Governor Davis along with top executives and business leaders in the state announce a jointDeclaration on Thursday committed to saving percent in overall electricity consumption With more than businesses and organizations statewide this energyconservation coalition sets the following goals among others to reduce energy use set temperatures for occupied space to degrees from May to October reduce lighting levels by percent and an additional percent upon the declaration of a Stage II emergency close blinds and shades when possible and turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay percent of back payments to some alternativeenergy generators The PUC postponed their vote to June on a proposal that would allow alternative generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it from PGE and Edison to remain in business The California State Senate Rules Committee in cooperation with the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further background information in its investigation into whether generators are illegally profiteering from the states

Commission to impose interim price caps until the California power market has stabilized Assembly Joint Resolution AJR specifically states that price caps be put in place at least until California is able to bring new energy supplies online and for the states massive conservation efforts to take effect The resolution asserts that California believes not enough has been done by the FERC to investigate price gouging by generators and control wholesale electricity prices and calls upon the federal regulatory agency to adhere to its governing statutes its vision statement and its own

happened at the prehearing conference today The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time most likely the ruling will be out within a week PX Audit The Commission will decide the issue on the current record this is fine with us Implementation of Suspension of DA This includes all the DASR issues ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings The following schedule was agreed to Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities Parties file comments on utilities proposal may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary Parties file responses on the comments All other issues will be addressed at another Prehearing conference on In response to a question the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue He also said several times however that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents To most logical people this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue but hey this is California Bottomline This turned out better than we had expected We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday November PM To Blachman Jeremy Mara Susan Steffes James D Shapiro Richard Kean Steven J Kaufman Paul Leff Dan Hughes Evan Sharp Vicki Williams Robert C Dietrich Janet Huddleson Diann Smith Mike Frazier Lamar Tribolet Michael Mellencamp Lisa Curry Wanda Swain Steve Subject Update on California PUC HearingDA Suspension Implementation Exit Fees PX Credit etc Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension With minor exceptions the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didnt need to conduct hearings and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees The utilities said that hearings could be held sometime later to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference The next hearing will be on Dec th The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday In sum there will be another hearing on Dec th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues At this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings Of particular note at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July and that he didnt think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either Worried that he said too much he then said he couldntshouldnt spead for the commissioner The judge and the Commissioner who was at the hearing went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that the Commission didnt need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and the Commission doesnt have the authority to ask to see contracts and they aint likely going to get them without a fight Though the probability many not be high there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity Interestingly Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January its proposal to charge all customersDA and bundled alikefor Edisons undercollection The judge literally laughed off the request and then said no As a result Edison didnt get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing eg why are you here you refuse to be a party you refuse to provide info etc From todays hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized In related news Davis has announced that hes asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that hed thus far met with two other generators in serious negotitations

first but if there is any questionwe should try to be as agressive as the law may allow Original Message From Ed Duncan mailtoEDuncanArterHaddencom Sent Monday September PM To Mara Susan MSSRcom Cc Lin Meyer Subject RE Revised Petition and Points and Authorities I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem The jurisdictional statute is PUC section a This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court A request for rehearing must be made within days after the PUC acts but there is no time within which the PUC must act If the PUC agreed to stay the Order then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court If the PUC refuses the stay request then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made In this case it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue EWD JBennett MSSRcom AM Sue I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum A couple of general comments We make the point throughout page is the first time that the Commissions action retroactive suspension will result in a windfall to the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs It is not clear to me that we can make this argument The commissions order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement The commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July are no longer allowed to continue on DA they will not go back and undo transactions that have already occurred In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court Section IV we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary We state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented Such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding the Commissions decision lacks the support it needs or on the flip side denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary In section VI e of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate we state that the Commissions motive is not the announced purpose that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy companies I dont think such an argument adds anything and although it maybe true at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies Jeanne Original Message From Mara Susan

Friday June PM ET Email this article to a friend Printerfriendly version LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market Duke Energy DUK news msgs Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and Reliant Energy Inc REI news msgs have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power the ability to influence electricity prices in Californias wholesale power market The ISO which manages the states highvoltage transmission system recently made a similar filing against AES Corp AES news msgs and Williams Cos WMB news msgs claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators authority to charge marketbased rates for their power supply Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations Weve obviously just got the filing and were reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing But were also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down Williams said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said the ISOs allegations are nothing new Its similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators Wheatley said The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing Steve Maviglio press secretary to Gov Gray Davis said the governor strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June Dynegys ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy companys production costs The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars retroactive to May of the difference between costbased ratesand the market revenues actually received Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke Reliant and Mirant The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged according to the filing In the filing generators have also been accused of megawattlaundering in which suppliers sell power outofstate that is resold to California at a higher price California consumers have spent billion for wholesale electricity in billion in and could pay as much as billion this year Charles Robinson the ISOs chief counsel said he is optimistic the state will prevail in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief were seeking He said FERC should implement an effective market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices FERC set up a market mitigation plan which went into effect June to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below Robinson said that plan wasnt good enough Wholesale power prices were at a sevenmonth low Thursday due in part to the new FERC plan cooler temperatures low naturalgas prices and conservation measures energy officials said Every three years FERC reviews generators ability to charge market rates for electricity Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices

sent to the other house for legislative hearings This weeks energy highlights include the following EVENTS Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta Lynch urging that Californias petroleum refineries and ancillary facilities be exempt from rotating outages The basis for the governors letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum products for several weeks The availability of petroleum derived transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of Californians Public safety agencies such as law enforcement emergency medical care responders and the military all rely on these fuels Without petroleum fuels the ability of these essentialuse customers to perform their critical functions would be seriously impaired said Governor Davis Governor Davis along with top executives and business leaders in the state announce a jointDeclaration on Thursday committed to

from the Governors office Also I have received a couple of calls about whether it is true that Senator Dunn rescheduled the generator hearing this week that had previously been cancelled The rumor is true but it is my understanding that the discussion has been occurring directly between Dunns office and individual lawyers for involved generators so I cant really add anything substantive to the mix OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS PUSHES FOR HOUSE VOTE ON WHOLESALE POWER PRICE RELIEF Oregon Washington State Governors Support Drive for Vote on Price Relief Legislation SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington today urged their Congressional delegations to sign a petition that would force a vote in the US House of Representatives on legislation to provide temporary electricity price relief to the western states I stand with my fellow Californians in the congressional delegation who have so strongly advocated for legislation to ensure just and reasonable electricity prices in our state it is important that that advocacy continue through efforts to discharge HR from the Energy and Commerce Committee wrote Gov Davis in a letter to House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERCWhile we all hope for good results from recent FERC actions we need to be prepared if they come up short If signed by a majority of House members the discharge petition would free price cap legislation from the House Commerce Committee where it has been bottled up for nearly two months Rep Jay Inslee DWash is the sponsor of the petition effort I continue to believe that costofservice based rates as imposed under HR are preferable to the market clearing price formula adopted by the FERC Gov Davis continued in his letter If the market mitigation scheme implemented by FERC on June fails to rein in wholesale prices it is essential that something stronger be considered After a year of inaction the focus and pressure brought to bear on FERC by Senate and House Members and Western governors resulted in the positive steps that the Commission has taken Governor John Kitzhaber DOre sent a similar letter The exorbitant unlawful prices our utilities have paid to a handful of power marketers have already hit Oregon households and businesses hard Energy supplier suppliers should refund overcharges to all Western utilities not just California utilities that have paid unjust and unreasonable prices for spot wholesale power over the past year Governor Gary Locke DWash also noted that I recognized that the FERCs actions to provide relief for Western consumers is largely due to political pressure from western Governors and Members of Congress I believe we must be prepared to further exert political pressure on the FERC and the Administration should this price cap scheme fail to protect Washington State consumers OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR DAVIS SWITCHES ON NEW ERA IN CALIFORNIAS ENERGY HISTORY Governor Opens First Major Power Plant in CA Since KERN COUNTY With the flick of a switch Governor Gray Davis launched on a new era in Californias energy history by ceremoniously switching on the megawatt Sunrise Power Project in Kern County Sunrise is the first major power plant to come on line in California since We are taking control of our energy destiny Governor Davis said This is the first major power plant built in California since Its clean efficient and it was built in record time The Sunrise Power Project is jointly owned by Edison Mission Energy and Texaco Power and Gasification Edison Mission Energy has agreed to sell the power generated at the Sunrise plant to Californias Department of Water Resources under a longterm contract at a reasonable rate By the summer of the plant is expected to produce megawatts Were building more new power plants than at any other time in our history Governor Davis said Next week I will be cutting the ribbon on the megawatt Sutter power plant near Yuba City It will be the largest gasfired power plant built in California in a generation Over the next two weeks well be bringing a combined total of more than MW on line enough to power the entire city of San Jose In the years before Governor Davis took office not a single major power plant was licensed in California Under Governor Davis leadership California has licensed major power plants and peaker plants Sunrise is the first of four scheduled to come on line this summer The combination of these new power plants with additional renewables distributed generation and rerates of existing power plants will bring more than new megawatts online by the end of September At no other time in the history of California have so many new power plants been under construction and in the pipeline Construction began on the Sunrise Power Project on December making it operational in a record and a half months The construction force worked hour days six days a week and the plant was brought on days ahead of schedule Because the plant was completed before July it is eligible for more than million in construction incentive payments under the Governors Executive Order D None of this would have been possible without the commitment of Edison Mission Energy Texaco and a dedicated construction force Governor Davis said I would like to commend Black and Veatch ARB and the State Building and Construction Trades Council for moving heaven and earth to bring this project on line ahead of schedule If not for your Herculean efforts we would not be here today

Extra power for summer will fall well short of Gov Davis promise This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Wednesday May SF Chronicle Its bad and itll get worseTROUBLE AHEAD Extra power for summer will fall well short of Gov Davis promise Carolyn Said Chronicle Staff Writer California will get only onethird of the new power that Gov Gray Davis promised to deliver by July virtually ensuring a brutal summer of blackouts for the energystrapped state Davis had pledged to take emergency measures to get extra megawatts up and running by summer Instead the state will have megawatts of the promised new power by July according to the California Energy Commission Even by Sept California will have added just megawatts The goal of megawatts enough to power million homes was crucial because it represents the gap between expected supply and demand this summer Were still hopeful we can get as many megawatts online this summer as possible said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar But we understand there are issues involved in the siting and construction of new power plants In fact experts said there are so many obstacles that the governors plan was unrealistic to begin with There are limits to what you can reasonably accomplish said Arthur ODonnell editor and associate publisher of the California Energy Markets newsletter Without a way to plug the gap between supply and demand California can expect a long dark summer Any warm day from May to October it doesnt even have to be abnormally warm California is going to be at risk for blackouts said Michael Zenker director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates an energy and economics consulting firm based in California He predicts that rolling blackouts in the state this summer will be in the hundreds of hours I expect Californians will grow pretty weary of them pretty quickly The California Independent System Operator which oversees about percent of the states straining grid has said that anytime its load hits megawatts or above California will be at risk of involuntary outages Last summer that mark was reached on days Whether this summer will exceed that number of days or not depends heavily on the weather If its a cool summer California might squeak by with relatively low power demand and fewer blackouts If the mercury rises electricity use will soar as people crank up their air conditioners and the lights will go off for tens of thousands of customers at a time This weeks warm temperatures and concurrent rolling blackouts are a clear harbinger of a pattern expected all summer Although power plants that were offline for maintenance aggravated the situation the weeks two blackouts tend to indicate that the blackouts well have as we get further into the summer will be deeper and more sustained said Zenker Exacerbating the states inability to generate enough homegrown power is the situation in the Pacific Northwest where drought conditions are severely curtailing hydroelectric production meaning that California cannot count on imports this summer The states next best hope for coping with the warm weather will be enticing consumers and businesses to raise their thermostats shut off their lights and shift their heavy usage to offpeak hours To avoid blackouts in California were going to need conservation said Jim McIntosh director of operations for the ISO Cutting consumption by percent could get megawatts off the grid according to Davis And the Energy Commission says that various measures enacted last September such as incentives for businesses to paint their roofs white reducing their airconditioning needs will save megawatts by June and megawatts by August The governors latest million campaign to encourage conservation could save an additional megawatts by summers end But energy experts say Davis may be overly rosy in his projections for cuts in home consumption Thats because the expected rate increases for electricity wont hit until June so customers would first see a spike in their bills in July Psychologically many people will start serious conservation measures only once theyve taken a hit in their pocketbooks Although Californians have already cut back enough to save megawatts during April I dont think more conservation will happen said Michael Shames head of the Utility Consumers Action Network Markets move slowly when it comes to changing energy conservation patterns Daviss ambitious building plan took several routes to add up to megawatts In part it relied on three huge power plants Los Medanos Sutter and Sunrise that had already been under construction for years and are certain to come online this summer But much of it was based on getting dozens of small energy providers to either increase output or build new facilities Those efforts foundered on several issues QFs Davis was counting on getting dozens of socalled qualifying facilities or QFs basically small alternative energy generators to ramp up production That plus restarting of two existing power plants would have added megawatts Instead most QFs will produce only the bare minimum and one of the power plants may not be restarted The QFs which are paid directly by Californias utilities are still owed millions of dollars for power they produced in December and January And a new payment scheme enacted by the California Public Utilities Commission will slash payments for power they generate in the future QFs say they will actually lose money if they run full tilt because they cant recoup their naturalgas costs Peakers Small temporary power plants called peakers accounted for megawatts of Daviss plan Although the Energy Commission sped up licensing for peakers many firms were competing for scarce resources to get the mini power plants built Theres an internal competition among power firms for transmission interconnections for naturalgas pipeline space for turbine parts ODonnell said I felt a fairly large amount of optimism was built into the peaker plan to begin with Email Carolyn Said at Coming up short How much more

MaraNAEnron on PM Beiser Megan AM To Allen Stevan Fairchild Tracy Manuel Erica Warner Jami cc Subject Sacramento BeeDan Weintraub column Consumer rep envisions ulti mate confrontation Team This is the best synopsis weve seen of Harvey Rosenfields motivations for putting a referendum on the ballot Daniel Weintraub Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation Sacramento Bee May Now that Gov Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats run over the Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to borrow billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases theres probably only one person who can stop him Harvey Rosenfield Rosenfield is the Santa Monicabased consumer advocate who tried to halt Californias experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started His ballot measure failed and that campaign is blamed in some circles for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the electricity shortage thats helped send prices heavenward But if Rosenfields last ballot initiative got the states energy establishment in a snit the one hes contemplating now would positively push them over the edge He is seriously considering launching a signature drive to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his billion energy bond measure That bond to be repaid by ratepayers is supposed to reimburse the states general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for consumers since January when Pacific Gas Electric and Southern California Edison ran out of money The bond measure also will be used to delay the pain of the extremely high prices expected this summer Without it consumers would immediately face another staggering rate increase probably well into triple digits The alternative would be a state budget in shambles All the tax money Davis has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for traditional services such as education roads and health care A referendum that killed the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound and his talk of a referendum may be just that Collecting signatures in less than days which is whats required to qualify the referendum would be a massive undertaking Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than that he will proceed But this is a man who has qualified two measures for the ballot already including one in that brought on regulation of the California insurance industry You have to take him seriously The question is why he would even consider it Why would a man who fancies himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers to swallow a massive rate hike or else bankrupt the state Because Rosenfields goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power system thats now serving California and raking in enormous profits for its owners And if it were up to him hed be willing to risk economic catastrophe to make it happen His theory is that the power generators will simply keep raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on the table It is he says like giving crack to an addict Take that money away and the generators will kick the habit fast If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed and politically or as a matter of economics you cant raise rates that high in the state the only thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say Im taking your plants At which point they will say OK all right were lowering our prices or some facesaving thing will happen The ultimate showdown between naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs And hes convinced that capitalism will blink If the lights go off in California and the economy goes down the tubes then years of Republican ideology of less government free markets competition all of that goes down the tubes All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy people want action and theyll do anything whether its seizing private property or whatever There will be a revolution and I dont think the political institutions in this country are prepared to push things to that point The Legislature already has set a Nov deadline after which the state budget is supposed to be offlimits to Davis powerbuying ways But thats not good enough for Rosenfield By then he thinks Davis will have burned through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total tab will be approaching billion Rates will have to rise again to pay that bill Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation without anesthesia to stop a painful and dangerous infection But he is not the only one thinking about the doomsday scenario The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut deals with the state They have offered to take caps on their profits forgive some of the debt thats owed them anything to keep the system running without further provoking the publics ire They know that Rosenfields kind of anger can be contagious They want to contain it before it spreads The Bees Daniel Weintraub can be reached at or at mailto

the bid for power had been sitting there for months and that Reliant had an understanding with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not supposed to be taken except in dire need its for a peaker and the price represents the opportunity cost of running it now and using up its very limited emission credits rather than running it during the real peak times this summer The represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have had its peaker available The wors is that the stateISO took the bid when there was not dire need just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever higher prices when yes the week before the Bush plan was to come out Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Fwd Reliants Reaction To Being Singled Out By Governor Davis Message from Tracey Bradley on Fri May To Justin Long Paul Fox cc Ronald Carroll Subject Reliants Reaction To Being Singled Out By Governor Davis May pm Eastern Time Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREMay Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis The accusations are simply not based on fact More importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer If anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to Californias energy shortage said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer Reliant Energy Wholesale Group We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis In fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer We are still waiting on a response Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California disputing the accusation of being obstructionist Reliant Energy has run its toyearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in In Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner Southern California Edison Reliant Energy invested million dollars in alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times In addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum For the last two years Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market In particular Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues In contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor Perkins said Unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year Last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding Perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations When necessary we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights hardly an illegal action To participate

Today with Financial Analysts Summary The host of the teleconference was Mr Joseph Fichera CEO of Saber Partners serving as Governors independent Bond Counsel Mr Ficheras goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to market sometime in June Fichera told me yesterday that he does these calls on an as needed basis There appeared to be some concern that the media is getting ahead of the story and the inference could be made that this is causing problems for the Governors MOU legislation which they also said they hope to have signed by June and perhaps for the emerging Plan B as well A replay of this teleconference is available at wwwenergyinfocagovca Mr Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections California State Senate Pieces of Governors MOU legislation moving in separate committees in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward Assembly Plan B Group Assemblymembers Keeley Dutra and Nation are working together and have good ideas to move the Governors MOU legislation through Fichera said that the Governors office is meeting with both parties but the plan is still in the formative stages He added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the proposal is imminent They are hopeful that it will be moving toward resolution in a week or two Generators Fichera stated that since the Governors meeting with the generators a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governors staff and advisors to resolve the issues He stated that the issue of litigation and investigations by the AGs office is off the table for discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and managing the coming summer QFs Governors team has facilitated days of discussions with SCE and QFs over past two weeks most QFs are represented at these negotiations They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market Their hope is that due to negotiations the QFS will all be fully available to the market this summer PGE They see the bankruptcy judges refusal to allow certain QFs to get out of their contracts as a positive development QFs online There are currently MWs offline this is better than their model anticipated for May They expect more than online by June Last month QF MWs offline Fichera explained that standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June during peaks but that they are allowed to be off during offpeak hours He added that they are still trying to resolve their issues Key aspects of budget plan by this I believe he meant energy financing not the annual budget conservation and contracts Conservation They built in a reduction in demand and reduction for price elasticityconservatively projecting in conservation He stated the we saw conservation in March and April so we think our model is conservative Fichera added that the new electricity rates go out in June and they expect that this will cause a good reaction due to price signals and demand reduction They also built in in natural load growth to their projections as well to further ensure a conservative estimate Energy Costs Projected billion vs actual billion equals a variance of May Energy Costs As of May th right on budget target with a variance of less than a half percent Contracts Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and reduce the net short exposure in the spot market He added that of necessary contracts are not yet executed but rather in the agreement in principal stage He released the following stats Needed executed contracts completed these percentages must refer to projected load accounted for for May for June for July for August When agreements in principle added in for June for July for August Questions from analysts Have you builtin an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of contracts No we do not because we are fighting the optout positions The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to be involved to stop that A few hundred MWs have gone into the market We are aware of this issue which is why were pushing the MOUsthis litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back payment issue would be settled Timing with SDGE where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle We have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations due to other decisions happening simultaneously around us We are resuming face to face negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement There is no drop dead date Generators working group Were discussing DWR credit issues summer support for MOUthe generators have issues with outstanding payments due The Governor expects them to provide haircut re those payments and thats part of discussion QF resolution will gas QFs be released from contracts We dont know what PGE is going to do but they could do that release at any timeno indications yethavent affirmed all the contracts yet We want to avoid this in the SCE situation There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply both utilities We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking for Bond issue timing The current plan assuming there is no further action by the legislature is to close sales days after bond sales on Aug We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period We are making a bridge loan from the General Fund In June we see improved revenue stream from ISO rate increases will also improve cash stream Can you give us any prices on new contracts Not on new contracts we are resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual contracts Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed so far Where is the legislature Legislators want to see sharing of the painso far the focus has been mostly on generators The undercollection is associated so far with the generators legislators are beginning to see that only about of the undercollection is tied to generators So should QFs and commercial banks share the pain Some think some are less guilty than others We can only deal with Edison The media has gotten a little ahead of the process this is going to take longer than a few weeks Handicap Lead horse The Assembly is more organized and focused right now on enhancements and changes to the Governors plan the Senate is not as organized though we have engaged with Senator Burtonwe met with him times this week And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to implement the Governors plan If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from contractshow does this affect your financial plans I think it would change it dramatically It would be a budget busting event Thats why were resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution Does this need to be solved before bond issue The combination of ABx and x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to recover all costs We think that only a few QFs can survive without longterm contracts so its also possible that not all would go into spot market few may be able to survive as merchant generators Windfall profits taxhelpfulness of generatorsdid they perform adequately during summer of What are your expectations of their performance The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mindhe left that open as to how hell evaluate their performance People at DWR and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this matter Bond issue timing We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell bonds by end of June if stars are alignedit may be one megadeal or several tronches spthis is still open for discussion Even with the rising prices that we expect this summer most of our net short will be under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we dont expect our budget to be busted Extended bridge financing commitmentirrelevant because we dont have authority to issue for days Renewable QFsgas pricesis there anything can you dolevelize gas prices so they can operate under Srack sp price formula Many options have been discussed to bring them into the market we need such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be worked out Polanco MOU legislation is it identical to the Governors view or already changed This is the implementing legislation for the Governors MOUnot changed so far Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that could be changed He went on to explain that anything taken out must be replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced This is going to take some time however we do have a sense of urgencywe are hoping for a vote sometime in June The MOU has deadline of August Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide

milder weather credited David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest level in more than a year partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices for natural gas which fuels most power plants Make no mistake Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead But for the first time since Californias energy markets went haywire last summer industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs California is not yet out of the woods said Kelley Doolan who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts But this is a very significant decrease in costs Along with lower gas prices the decline in electricity costs was attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather which reduces demand for power They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and betterthanexpected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association said these factors came together to produce the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as little as per megawatt hour he noted compared with more than earlier this year If the weather stays this way we could have reasonable prices all summer Ackerman said We may also have fewer blackouts It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in energy prices If power companies manipulated prices on the way up as critics have alleged might they not be up to some trick as prices head in the opposite direction Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in the dysfunctional California market Theyre trying to take the heat off she said Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistical blip This was just one months decline said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego We really have to see how this plays out in the future Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor was very encouraged by the lower energy prices Davis announced Sunday that Californias power use was down percent last month from a year before Were not there yet Maviglio said of whether an end to the states power woes is in sight But the trend is pointing in the right direction WHITE ELEPHANT Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side California could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about billion in public funds on longterm power contracts The logic behind the contracts which are at an average price of per megawatt hour over years is that the state expected to pay belowmarket rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and California found itself paying abovemarket rates If current trends continue though California will find itself paying consistently abovemarket rates much sooner than expected making the long term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so handsomely during the states darkest hours The contracts look really ugly right now said Shames at the Utility Consumers Action Network They may be way overpriced Maviglio the governors spokesman said it is too early to conclude that the state did poorly negotiating dozens of longterm power contracts No one has a crystal ball on this he said CUSTOMERS BILLS TO DROP In any case Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that customers average gas bills will drop percent this month to and should stay near that level all summer Platts which monitors average monthly spot prices found that the wholesale price of gas at the CaliforniaOregon border has tumbled nearly percent since the beginning of May from per million British thermal units to The wholesale gas price at the CaliforniaArizona border fell percent from to This compares with a percent monthly decline in average natural gas prices nationwide However California gas prices are still about percent higher than they were a year ago whereas national prices are now below yearago levels for the first time since last spring While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer he said That created enormous demand for electricity generation What has changed is that weve had weeks of mild weather Doolan observed The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas This allowed utilities like PGE to beef up gas inventories which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices he said BACK ON TRACK Were back on track to be completely full for winter said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Thats a very good thing Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter PGE is forecasting that customers average gas bills could rise to as high as in December if current trends continue However the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that Californias unusually high costs at last may be abating Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

levels for the first time since last spring While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer he said That created enormous demand for electricity generation What has changed is that weve had weeks of mild weather Doolan observed The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas This allowed utilities like PGE to beef up gas inventories which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices he said BACK ON TRACK Were back on track to be completely full for winter said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Thats a very good thing Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter PGE is forecasting that customers average gas bills could rise to as high as in December if current trends continue However the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that Californias unusually high costs at last may be abating Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

THE FPA MOTION SEEKING ORDER OR STAY CANCELING OR SUSPENDING CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES LONGTERM ENERGY CONTRACTS AND ASSOCIATED IOU RATE SCHEDULES FOR LACK OF PROPER NOTICE UNDER THE FPA Pursuant to Rules of the Rules and Practices and Procedures of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC CFR CAlifornians for Renewable Energy Inc CARE moves for the Commissions consideration and action to remedy the illegal execution of longterm energy contracts by the California Department of Water Resources DWR in regards to the CARE and other partys complaints in EL etal Under section c of the Federal Power Act Stat USC dc the DWR longterm energy contracts recently disclosed through legal action by the California legislature and press requires that these contracts shall be tendered for filing with the Commission and posted not less than sixty days nor more than one hundredtwenty days prior to the date on which the electric service is to commence We contend that DWR has failed to comply with the requirements of the FPA in this matter The remedy CARE seeks is for the Commission to issue an Order or Stay canceling or suspending such longterm energy contracts and associated IOU rate schedules yet to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to FPA section c DWR disputes its requirements to provide proper notice prior to execution of said longterm contracts to all the parties to this case and to the public who have in a statutory and constitutional right to comment on expenditures of the publics funds in this manner by DWR In response to CAREs CPRA request DWR states the Departments purchases and sales of power are exempt from the Federal Power Act because DWR is a state agency Section f To the extent that the Department engages in purchases or sales with counterparties who are subject to Federal Power Act jurisdiction any obligation to file with FERC or otherwise comply with the Act lies with the counterparty to the contract and not the department CARE contends that DWR is acting as an designated representative for the Investor Owned Utilities IOUs in the purchase of energy in California pursuant to CFR a without authorization by the Commission In cases where two or more public utilities are required to file rate schedules or certificates of concurrence such public utilities may authorize a designated representative to file upon behalf of all parties if upon written request such parties have been granted Commission authorization therefore CARE contends these actions by DWR violated the requirements of CFR e No public utility shall directly or indirectly demand charge collect or receive any rate charge or compensation for or in connection with electric service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or impose any classification practice rule regulation or contract with respect thereto which is different from that provided in a rate schedule required to be on file with this Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by order of the Commission for good cause shown CARE contends that ample evidence of DWRs acting as the California IOUs designated representative is provided by DWRs request to the California Public Utilities Commission PUC for a Revised Revenue Requirement and Power Purchase Costs Pursuant to Water Code Section and Public Utilities Code Section which is further illustrated by the PUCs Administrative law Judges Ruling on the August Revenue Requirement of the DWR regarding the IOU SDG E applications and to the PUC which states SDGE shall present alternative calculations of the required system average rate increases that collect the DWRrelated rate increases over the remaining quarters of the revenue requirement period set forth in Table A ie the fourth quarter of and the four quarters of collect the DWRrelated rate increases over the next quarters ie the fourth quarter of the four quarters of and the first three quarters of and collect the DWRrelated rate increases over the period from September through December Clearly it is the intent of the DWR to act as the IOUs designated representative to seek approval from the PUC to collect the DWRrelated rate increases CARE reiterates it is the public policy that public agencies exist to aid in the conduct of the peoples business and that the proceedings of public agencies be conducted openly so that the public may remain informed It is the intent of the law that actions of public agencies be taken openly and that their deliberation be conducted openly The people do not yield their sovereignty to those agencies that serve them The people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created DWR has breached its public duties by failing to provide for myself CARE its members and other members of the public our statutory and constitutional right to comment or protest these longterm energy contracts executed by DWR the associated expenditures of the publics funds and associated rate increases to California energy consumers In conclusion the Remedy CARE seeks is for the Commission to issue an Order or Stay canceling or suspending such longterm energy contracts and associated IOU rate schedules yet to be submitted to the Commission pursuant to FPA section c or under what ever statutory authority as you deem appropriate Respectfully submitted Michael E Boyd President CARE

TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR Once the CPUC decides on the DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generationrelat ed CTC again There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond once QF contracts are above the market SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and rebill begining with Jan it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a onehalf cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of cents ma king it about cents that collects the million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge The half cent addition is for months Original Message From Curry Wanda SentFriday August AM ToSwain Steve Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ruffer Mary Lynne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Mara Susan CcGorny Vladimir Bradford William S SubjectSummary or PX Credit Proposals I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August th Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August th Current Issues The methodology for calculating PX credits after January is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies Applicability of the cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not Impact to Enron if FERC implements retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct thru January th which result in revised PX credits Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the g ross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationcomm odity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent wi ll be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an allowabl e claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possib le PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balan ces on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility pare nt level Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits ifwhen an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC Other consideration Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts PGE Recommended Approach This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January would include an avoided cost component This avoided cost component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDWR pur chases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchases This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX clearing p rice in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDWR purch ase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embedded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would hamper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from January through September and that the SCE approach is applicab le from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a comp romise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP and SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG E and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low However und erstanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and C PUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk but th is is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated with the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda

August AM To Subject FW Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message Original Message From Dan Douglass mailto Sent Wednesday August PM To Weller Andrea Norman Plotkin Subject Re Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDGE is suggesting From a strictly legal perspective it is unlikely that the Commission would vote to suspend direct access retroactively Although an argument could be put forward that the Commission has the authority to do so such an act could be challenged on US Constitutional grounds as being violative of the Contracts Clause Moreover from a practical perspective retroactive suspension would be politically unpalatable and cause a good deal of protest from affected parties However the Commission might choose to so regardless of these factors due to political pressure from Sacramento to ensure the saleability of the power revenue bonds The Commission has frequently reserved to itself the power to modify existing contracts particularly those entered into by utilities subject to its jurisdiction It has exercised this right often using as justification wording contained in utility contracts that make the agreements subject to the Commissions continuing jurisdiction including such modifications as it may direct For example the standard ESP Service Agreement used by all three of the states electric utilities provides that This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction and the Parties may amend the Agreement to conform to changes directed or necessitated by the CPUC This phraseology is typically referred to by the states utilities as a regulatory out clause However this sort of wording has not been required to be included in the contracts entered into by ESPs as the Commission does not regulate these entities ESPs that plan to offer electric services to residential and small commercial customers must fulfill certain registration requirements as adopted by the Commission in Decisions D and D in accordance with Public Utilities Code Section b However ESPs who serve larger customers are not even subject to this registration requirement Most importantly ESP terms and conditions of service are not subject to regulation by the Commission Therefore the regulatory out language cited above is not customarily included in standard contracts signed between ESPs and their customers The absence of a regulatory out clause would make Commission efforts to modify retroactively contracts entered into between ESPs and their customers extremely suspect This is due to the fact that such action could be seen as violative of Section of Article I of the United States Constitution It provides in part that No State shall pass any Bill of Attainder ex post facto Law or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts Emphasis added Under the Supreme Courts Contracts Clause jurisprudence the threshold inquiry is whether the state law has in fact operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship Allied Structural Steel Co v Spannaus US This inquiry has three components whether there is a contractual relationship whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship and whether the impairment is substantial General Motors Corporation v Romein US The Contracts Clause only applies to contracts that exist at the time of the laws passage Also the Contracts Clause has been deemed to apply both to legislation or other government action but not to court decisions The judiciary has the power to invalidate a contract without violating the Contracts Clause See Tidal Oil v Flanagan US In a case involving a private contract the law or governmental action must substantially impair a preexisting contractual relationship Once this hurdle is met the government must demonstrate that the law imposes reasonable conditions appropriate to achieving a significant and legitimate public purpose Often when faced with such an issue the courts defer to the legislative judgment However this does not prevent an independent investigation of the relevant factual situation This is probably far more than you wanted to knowjust wanted to give a quick overview on the subject Bottom line CPUC would be dumb to suspend retroactively at least from a legal perspective On the other hand when has brilliance been a hallmark of recent decisions from this Commission Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel

you all think about this What SDGE is saying is inconsistent with the intent of the statement made in the most recent ALJ Barnett Resolution which states In the interest of fairness written contracts

UnionTribune Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear This article specifically mentions the threatened lawsuit by AREM as having caused the PUC to drop its proposed order to ban direct access retroactively Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER September SACRAMENTO Some utility customers mainly businesses are rushing to sign contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a longdelayed ban raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining customers The state plans to ban direct access contracts with generators to keep customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state since January Those state purchases will be covered in part by a billion bond paid off by ratepayers over years But many businesses which say they need cheaper power now to remain competitive are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the Public Utilities Commission bans directaccess pacts an action that could come as soon as tomorrow We have seen a significant increase in the last month said Ed Van Herik a spokesman for San Diego Gas Electric Co He said the amount of the annual SDGE power load shifted to directaccess contracts with generators increased from percent at the end of July to percent at the end of last month Allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of the states failed attempt to deregulate electricity But when the utilities ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow the state began buying power for utility customers in January To avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase the state decided to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining decadelong power contracts and issuing the billion ratepayer bond Now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons paying their fair share of the statesubsidized power received earlier this year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the longterm contracts and the bond The power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain earlier this year when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the state raised rates for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison by about onethird The state has not raised rates for SDGE customers But an increase averaging percent for SDGE residential customers is on the PUC agenda tomorrow along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way for issuing the billion ratepayer bond PUC President Loretta Lynch said that before wholesale power prices began soaring last year about percent of the power provided by the three investorowned utilities was being bought through directaccess contracts By last March she said the amount dropped to percent Certainly the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year Lynch said But as wholesale power prices dropped in June directaccess contracts began to look like a better deal and a number of customers have left the utilities to get cheaper power At Southern California Edison the number of customers with directaccess contracts grew from on June to by the end of last month an increase of said Steve Hansen an Edison spokesman Now that the market has turned everyone is bailing as fast as they can said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer group Most of the electricity obtained through directaccess contracts in recent months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of electricity Most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing business in the state said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who with Lynch outlined the PUCs proposed actions at a Capitol news conference late last month The PUC delayed action to ban directaccess contracts waiting for the Legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass the utilities if they paid an exit fee to cover their share of statesubsidized power The ban on directaccess contracts originally proposed by the PUC would have been retroactive to July But the retroactive provision was reportedly dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets a group of power marketers In the Legislature a provision allowing utility customers to obtain directaccess contracts beginning in if they pay exit fees was added to the Assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep Edison from joining PGE in bankruptcy The addition of the directaccess provision is one reason that the Assembly version of the Edison plan is supported by the California Chamber of Commerce But the Assembly plan pushed by Gov Gray Davis faces opposition in the Senate Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco said the Senate would send an Edison bill back to the Assembly after making it a lessegregious giveaway to the utility The main provision in the Assembly plan would allow Edison to eliminate most of its debt by issuing billion in bonds that would be paid off by ratepayers The Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights a consumer group in Santa Monica calls the Edison plan a bailout and is threatening to place a measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it be approved by the Legislature and governor And TURN the San Francisco consumer group says the Assembly version of the Edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan approved by the Senate in July and giving Edison an additional billion The consumer group also says the directaccess provision in the Assemblys Edison plan has major loopholes that would allow large customers to leave the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs TURN opposes the reintroduction of direct access because any savings that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the result of cost shifting to those who do not or cannot abandon utility service the consumer group said in a statement Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co Erica Manuel Edelman

could rule after paper hearings The following schedule was agreed to Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities Parties file comments on utilities proposal may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary Parties file responses on the comments All other issues will be addressed at another Prehearing conference on In response to a question the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue He also said several times however that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents To most logical people this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue but hey this is California Bottomline This turned out better than we had expected We wanted hearings on the

Steve Subject Update on California PUC HearingDA Suspension Implementation Exit Fees PX Credit etc Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension With minor exceptions the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didnt need to conduct hearings and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees The utilities said that hearings could be held sometime later to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference The next hearing will be on Dec th The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday In sum there will be another hearing on Dec th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues At this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings Of particular note at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July and that he didnt think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either Worried that he said too much he then said he couldntshouldnt spead for the commissioner The judge and the Commissioner who was at the hearing went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that the Commission didnt need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and the Commission doesnt have the authority to ask to see contracts and they aint likely going to get them without a fight Though the probability many not be high there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity Interestingly Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January its proposal to charge all customersDA and bundled alikefor Edisons undercollection The judge literally laughed off the request and then said no As a result Edison didnt get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing eg why are you here you refuse to be a party you refuse to provide info etc From todays hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized In related news Davis has announced that hes asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that hed thus far

specifically prohibits you from setting this type of deadline What am I missing Please explain your rationale for violating a specific order of the CPUC By the way it was interesting to learn that you now want to discuss this at the PHC At our meeting Monday the utilities including Edison were quite firm that they did not want to address these issues in the PHC but wanted to complete the Advice Letter process Sue Mara Original Message From mailto Sent Friday November PM To Mara Susan Cc Riley Tom Subject RE Pending DASRs for Existing Enron Customers Hi Sue Im sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be discussed at the PHC Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA customers entered into contracts by the suspension date SCE is using the cutoff date to fulfill

cc PM Riley Tom Subject RE Pending DASRs for Existing Enron Customers Matt I thought Id respond for Diann The decision is pretty clear on this As you recall the issue was raised by UCCSU who specifically mentioned that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of customer names and DASRs Let me quote Section F p In its rehearing application UCCSU seek clarification on whether Ds prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after September allows or requires utilities to refuse to process DASRs for an account under a preSeptember contract p We reaffirm that for the time being and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service p For purpose of utility compliance with D we want to make it clear that unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before September Matt these are just the highlights The Decision has more language providing additional clarity By the way this decision was mailed on October after your October deadline I think the Decision is crystal clear You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or before September and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those DASRs So given the above Can you please explain your position Regarding the Novemver date you may remember the Rule meeting held by the utilities ESPs and customers in eaarly October The ESPs agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by November with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added

read the PGE reps answer again I think Tom Heckman misinterpreted what Rod Lee said I agree with Rod Lee He did not say that Enron could not submit DASRs he said we had to have the account on the list and if we did then the DASR would be processed If we did not have the account on the list there would have to be some verification that the contract was signed on or before Enron and the other ESPs previously agreed with this approach although the utilities did not fully buy into it I believe Diann submitted the account information as we had agreed on Nov I take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject DASRs for accounts not on the Nov list until the contract is verified but I believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with ESPs and utilities on Oct I think Mr Heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities but thats not how I read the reply from Mr Lee So I called Peter Ouberg back and said told him there didnt appear to be a problem after all but that I would let him know if one cropped up IF you would like me to speak to Mr Heckman I would be happy to do so Sue Mara Original Message From Riley Tom

Access DASRs Tom The CPUCs Decision specifically prohibits any new contracts agreements arrangements post Sept th Accounts that were under contract on or prior to September th are eligible for DA at anytime afterwards The Commission has ordered the UDCs to accept DASRs indefinitely for customer accounts that meet the Sept th customer contract deadline The November deadline still exists presumably Enron has submitted Sutters valid account numbers on that list If DASRs are submitted on accounts that are not on the list they will be rejected until such time that verification of a legitimate contract exists Roderick Lee Corporate Account Manager Office Cell Phone Fax Original Message From Heckmann Thomas mailto mailto Sent Friday November PM To Lee Rod Subject Forthcoming Direct Access DASRs Rod On the question of whether new accounts can be added to old contracts The October PGE implementation plan for direct access winddown you recently shared with me gave deadlines of October and November respectively for ESPs to provide names of customers and details of customer accounts to be added to direct access I quote additional wording referring to the above timelines require ESPs to specify those customers by name whose contracts qualify them for the submission of additional DASRs Thus PGEs plan clearly contemplates the addition of new accounts to old contracts Now October CPUC ruling D states For purposes of utility compliance with D we want to make it clear that unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September Therefore it being PGEs intent to let new accounts be DASRd to old agreements which include a provision for adding new accounts and it being the CPUCs explicit ruling that no time limit be set on this activity Sutter Health is moving forward with plans to add a number of accounts to its current direct access arrangement with Enron Please let me know if you anticipate any barriers to this action at your end as arrangements with Enron will take a lot of time and energy Cordially Tom

<10905664.1075842966005.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,susan.mara@enron.com,2000-09-08 07:06:00,Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Cc Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREMay Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis The accusations are simply not based on fact More importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer If anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to Californias energy shortage said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer Reliant Energy Wholesale Group We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis In fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer We are still waiting on a response Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California disputing the accusation of being obstructionist Reliant Energy has run its toyearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in In Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner Southern California Edison Reliant Energy invested million dollars in alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times In addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum For the last two years Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market In particular Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues In contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor Perkins said Unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year Last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding Perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations When necessary we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights hardly an illegal action To participate

the financial markets as the Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to market sometime in June Fichera told me yesterday that he does these calls on an as needed basis There appeared to be some concern that the media is getting ahead of the story and the inference could be made that this is causing problems for the Governors MOU legislation which they also said they hope to have signed by June and perhaps for the emerging Plan B as well A replay of this teleconference is available at wwwenergyinfocagovca Mr Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections California State Senate Pieces of Governors MOU legislation moving in separate committees in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward Assembly Plan B Group Assemblymembers Keeley Dutra and Nation are working together and have good ideas to move the Governors MOU legislation through Fichera said that the Governors office is meeting with both parties but the plan is still in the formative stages He added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the proposal is imminent They are hopeful that it will be moving toward resolution in a week or two Generators Fichera stated that since the Governors meeting with the generators a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governors staff and advisors to resolve the issues He stated that the issue of litigation and investigations by the AGs office is off the table for discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and managing the coming summer QFs Governors team has facilitated days of discussions with SCE and QFs over past two weeks most QFs are represented at these negotiations They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market Their hope is that due to negotiations the QFS will all be fully available to the market this summer PGE They see the bankruptcy judges refusal to allow certain QFs to get out of their contracts as a positive development QFs online There are currently MWs offline this is better than their model anticipated for May They expect more than online by June Last month QF MWs offline Fichera explained that standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June during peaks but that they are allowed to be off during offpeak hours He added that they are still trying to resolve their issues Key aspects of budget plan by this I believe he meant energy financing not the annual budget conservation and contracts Conservation They built in a reduction in demand and reduction for price elasticityconservatively projecting in conservation He stated the we saw conservation in March and April so we think our model is conservative Fichera added that the new electricity rates go out in June and they expect that this will cause a good reaction due to price signals and demand reduction They also built in in natural load growth to their projections as well to further ensure a conservative estimate Energy Costs Projected billion vs actual billion equals a variance of May Energy Costs As of May th right on budget target with a variance of less than a half percent Contracts Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and reduce the net short exposure in the spot market He added that of necessary contracts are not yet executed but rather in the agreement in principal stage He released the following stats Needed executed contracts completed these percentages must refer to projected load accounted for for May for June for July for August When agreements in principle added in for June for July for August Questions from analysts Have you builtin an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of contracts No we do not because we are fighting the optout positions The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to be involved to stop that A few hundred MWs have gone into the market We are aware of this issue which is why were pushing the MOUsthis litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back payment issue would be settled Timing with SDGE where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle We have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations due to other decisions happening simultaneously around us We are resuming face to face negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement There is no drop dead date Generators working group Were discussing DWR credit issues summer support for MOUthe generators have issues with outstanding payments due The Governor expects them to provide haircut re those payments and thats part of discussion QF resolution will gas QFs be released from contracts We dont know what PGE is going to do but they could do that release at any timeno indications yethavent affirmed all the contracts yet We want to avoid this in the SCE situation There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply both utilities We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking for Bond issue timing The current plan assuming there is no further action by the legislature is to close sales days after bond sales on Aug We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period We are making a bridge loan from the General Fund In June we see improved revenue stream from ISO rate increases will also improve cash stream Can you give us any prices on new contracts Not on new contracts we are resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual contracts Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed so far Where is the legislature Legislators want to see sharing of the painso far the focus has been mostly on generators The undercollection is associated so far with the generators legislators are beginning to see that only about of the undercollection is tied to generators So should QFs and commercial banks share the pain Some think some are less guilty than others We can only deal with Edison The media has gotten a little ahead of the process this is going to take longer than a few weeks Handicap Lead horse The Assembly is more organized and focused right now on enhancements and changes to the Governors plan the Senate is not as organized though we have engaged with Senator Burtonwe met with him times this week And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to implement the Governors plan If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from contractshow does this affect your financial plans I think it would change it dramatically It would be a budget busting event Thats why were resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution Does this need to be solved before bond issue The combination of ABx and x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to recover all costs We think that only a few QFs can survive without longterm contracts so its also possible that not all would go into spot market few may be able to survive as merchant generators Windfall profits taxhelpfulness of generatorsdid they perform adequately during summer of What are your expectations of their performance The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mindhe left that open as to how hell evaluate their performance People at DWR and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this matter Bond issue timing We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell bonds by end of June if stars are alignedit may be one megadeal or several tronches spthis is still open for discussion Even with the rising prices that we expect this summer most of our net short will be under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we dont expect our budget to be busted Extended bridge financing commitmentirrelevant because we dont have authority to issue for days Renewable QFsgas pricesis there anything can you dolevelize gas prices so they can operate under Srack sp price formula Many options have been discussed to bring them into the market we need such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be worked out Polanco MOU legislation is it identical to the Governors view or already changed This is the implementing legislation for the Governors MOUnot changed so far Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that could be changed He went on to explain that anything taken out must be replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced This is going to take some time however we do have a sense of urgencywe are hoping for a vote sometime in June The MOU has deadline of August Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide

the language keeping DA alive the decision is attached its short D page March Finally due to pending legislation which would alter Section we shall stay action on implementation of the suspension of direct access under Water Code Section until further order Jeff Please fill in the discussion of the MOU below bullet The term Surcharge is only applicable until the end of the AB rate freeze which will end no later than March and may end earlier if a federal court finds in PGESCE favor or b California legislature mandates an earlier enddate or c the CPUC decides to actually complete its proceeding to value the retained assets and calculate an end to the rate freeze which would take months Surcharge is a term of art to get around the problems of the AB rate freeze At the end of the AB rate freeze it is my understanding that the CPUC will modify fully the rate structure and level to ensure full cost recovery on a going forward basis therefore Utility Retained Generation QF expense CDWR current expenses both energy purchase and financing costs will be included Some members of the CPUC signaled in the May decision noted below that they intended to investigate bottoms up rate making this is preferred by AReM and many others Theoretically it would clearly separate generationprocurementretail sales functions from other charges such as T and D DA sustomers would only be charged for T D etc not the other If done correctly even charges included now in T D such as some ISOrelated functions would be moved out to make the TD charges pure wires charges This approach would be preferred Any bottoms up proceeding would take months and unlikely to be concluded before the end of this year Other outstanding costs will include Utility Undercollection from May until when no additional CAISO costs are applied or until rates cover costs and CDWR costs beginning Jan until the end of AB rate freeze or the end of DWRs purchasing activities Understanding how all these costs will be recovered and by whom will most likely probability be decided by the Legislature with some decisionmaking by the CPUC If theLegislature does not take this up it will be decided by the bankruptcy court or federal court Utility Undercollection Bypass So far the Legislature has done nothing to address the utility undercollection except for San Diego which has a balancing account but no way to cfollect it yet SCEs MOU does address this by INSERT BY JEFF The MOU has received bad reviews by the Legislature but Enron has been supporting it with some changes and a bipartisan group of Legislators has been analyzing it and intends to propose amendments Probablility that utility undercollection is dealt with by the Legislature Various bills in the Legislature have been introduced to delete the language in ABX that gave the CPUC the right to terminate DA A diverse group of business interests called the Direct Access Coalition has been pushing for this and for a bill that takes care of DWRs potential stranded cost problem but provides flexibility for direct access Our current assessment is as follows Bypass allowed for payment of DWR costs Jan thru rate freeze end probability for people who never were on Utility Service for people who used Utility Service post Jan but build selfgen or incorporate energy efficiencyload management also chance for day amnesty period for people to select direct access and chance for free direct access without surcharge or exit fee for those who switch while DWR has a net short position CDWR Net Unavoidable Bypass for people who used Utility Service post Jan for others LEGISLATION IMPACTING THIS DECISION There are three key direct access bills being considered the Bowen bill SBx the Kelley bill ABx and the Battin bill SBx The Bowen bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in ABx and replace it with the following if a customer has not bought from an electric utility on or after Jan there are no charges except there may be an entrance fee to use the electric utility going forward and if a customer wants to switch from an electric utility to an ESP they must pay to the department any uncollected amounts equivalent to the departments net unavoidable cost of power procurement including any financing costs attributable to that customer to ensure the satisfaction of any power purchase obligation or bond obligation to serve that customer The recovery period shall be coincident with the terms of bonds issued to finance the purchases The CPUC has days from the effective date to notify customers of their obligations The Kelley bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in ABx and replace it with the following if a customer has not bought from an electric utility on or after Jan there are no charges every customer is allowed to buy from an ESP a of their load equal to the amount served by Utility Retained Generation not CDWR purchases with no charges after the effective date any customer that buys from the electric utility and wants to switch must pay to ensure satisfaction of any power purchase obligation or bond obligation incurred by the department with the following constraints a for res and small commercial customers if DA load is less than load growth or b to self gen customers if the customer has given days prior notification or c if the customer has given DWR months advance written notice then only a fee equal to months unavoidable costs The CPUC has days from the effective date to notify customers of their obligations The Battin bill would still reviewing Keep in mind that all of these bills are in flux As described above the DA Coaltion is pushing hard for a good direct access bill that provides some flexibility and has its own language that it is floating Even with exit fees the Coalitions proposed language would require DWR to base the fee on a calculation of its actual costs from losing the load Enron is also pushing to make direct access part of any compromise settlement and the Republicans have taken the same approach CPUC DECISIONS IMPACTING THIS March Decision Implementing ABX decided not begin the process to terminate direct access May Order DA doesnt pay DWR expenses going forward and the cent surcharge does not apply to DA customersGood for bypass of these costs We expect the utilities to file Petitions to Modify the decision to argue that they cannot implement it they will likely seek to have the charge appply to DA Customers and then put the same amount in the credit Given the problems we all have with the negative credit and the utilities notion of a zero bill there will be much opposition to the utilities proposal The utilities chance of success on this is less than Proposed action Alliance for Retail Energy Markets AReM will begin pushing to stop charging the current cent surcharge to DA customers to be consistent with the May decision Chance of success is Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

Chronicle Its making its way in the press My Award for Most Expected Response the consumer advocates who now argue that the generators are manipulating prices downward Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM smara Sent by PM To smara cc Subject SF Gate Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Wednesday June SF Chronicle Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest level in more than a year partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices for natural gas which fuels most power plants Make no mistake Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead But for the first time since Californias energy markets went haywire last summer industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs California is not yet out of the woods said Kelley Doolan who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts But this is a very significant decrease in costs Along with lower gas prices the decline in electricity costs was attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather which reduces demand for power They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and betterthanexpected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association said these factors came together to produce the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as little as per megawatt hour he noted compared with more than earlier this year If the weather stays this way we could have reasonable prices all summer Ackerman said We may also have fewer blackouts It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in energy prices If power companies manipulated prices on the way up as critics have alleged might they not be up to some trick as prices head in the opposite direction Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in the dysfunctional California market Theyre trying to take the heat off she said Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistical blip This was just one months decline said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego We really have to see how this plays out in the future Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor was very encouraged by the lower energy prices Davis announced Sunday that Californias power use was down percent last month from a year before Were not there yet Maviglio said of whether an end to the states power woes is in sight But the trend is pointing in the right direction WHITE ELEPHANT Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side California could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about billion in public funds on longterm power contracts The logic behind the contracts which are at an average price of per megawatt hour over years is that the state expected to pay belowmarket rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and California found itself paying abovemarket rates If current trends continue though California will find itself paying consistently abovemarket rates much sooner than expected making the long term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so handsomely during the states darkest hours The contracts look really ugly right now said Shames at the Utility Consumers Action Network They may be way overpriced Maviglio the governors spokesman said it is too early to conclude that the state did poorly negotiating dozens of longterm power contracts No one has a crystal ball on this he said CUSTOMERS BILLS TO DROP In any case Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that customers average gas bills will drop percent this month to and should stay near that level all summer Platts which monitors average monthly spot prices found that the wholesale price of gas at the CaliforniaOregon border has tumbled nearly percent since the beginning of May from per million British thermal units to The wholesale gas price at the CaliforniaArizona border fell percent from to This compares with a percent monthly decline in average natural gas prices nationwide However California gas prices are still about percent higher than they were a year ago whereas national prices are now below yearago levels for the first time since last spring While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer he said That created enormous demand for electricity generation What has changed is that weve had weeks of mild weather Doolan observed The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas This allowed utilities like PGE to beef up gas inventories which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices he said BACK ON TRACK Were back on track to be completely full for winter said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Thats a very good thing Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter PGE is forecasting that customers average gas bills could rise to as high as in December if current trends continue However the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that Californias unusually high costs at last may be abating Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

Mercantile Exchange SUBJECT Hertzberg Edison new proposal is de ja vu all over a gain When it comes to having nerve SoCal Edison takes second to no one The latest rescue proposal announced by Speaker Hertzberg has a familiar ri ng to it like the dinner bell at the shark tank at Sea World The Hertzberg memo and a Dow Jones story are included in this memo A summary of the primary terms of HertzbergEdisons plan is as follows o Large users of electricity kw and up would have dir ect access after two years o Residential and small businesses would be reregulated o The ransom for direct access is that businesses would be required to retire Edisons billion or so in debtand that the obligation would follow them to the land of direct access Does anything sound familiar here hintthink AB without the surplu s budget and electricity of Remember the CPUC action and A B SCE was a very active and influential player in that process Here s a short review of AB o Direct access would be allowed projected to be about after the utilities stranded costs were retired Note At the time of the bankruptcy of the PX in March direct access was not just elusiveit had been banned by the passage of AB X in January o The state created California Power Exchange was mandatory for the utilitiesthough by they began urgently to use alternatives they w ere refused on at least four occasions by CPUC action to use sources outside t he PX o Stranded costs determined inside the PX pricing mechanism were applied to all transactions that occurred outside the PX thus the obligati on followed those seeking an alternative market to the PX o The mandatory PX forced the market into a dayahead pricing schem e that effective placed the vast majority of California electricity pricing into the volatile spot market If this were not California one would have to say that this is unbelievable but the legislativeregulatory track record since in California is consistent if anything Adoption of this plan would not onl y mean that Californians did not get the baby direct access after payin g the ransom the Competition Transition Charge CTC since BUT they ve been taken hostage themselves now and another ransom is due California Kafkaesque Since the beginning of the deregulatory process in California has taken a novel approach to its energy marketsUnfortunately that novel must have been written by Franz Kafka HertzbergEdison Plan A Fair Plan for California Assembly Democratic Caucus What the California public believes about the energy crisis Utilities are to blame Outofstate generators have made huge profits We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand Deregulation is a failure The economy of the state is at risk What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis Reregulation restore balance to system Very small if any rate increases Reliability of supply no more blackouts No permanent damage to environment more emphasis on renewable sources Penalties for those who gouged the state Guarantee this wont happen again Themes of the Fair Plan Federal role The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair reasonable rates Restore fairness Solutions must protect residential and small business users Reregulation Reassert our authority over Californias energy destiny Stability Reliability Increase supply and keep a lid on rates Goals of the Fair Plan Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates Restore regulated utilities to creditworthiness to enable them to resume role of energy supplier Ensure that megausers of electricity have direct access to independent electricity providers to protect Californias economy Many elements of the proposed Edison MOU remain unchanged except for Option to purchase the transmission system Reregulates service for all residential and small business consumers Provides direct access to providers for megausers above kW Megausers pay DRC to cover SCE debt Added elements to the MOU Transmission option at book value Federal tax refund must be applied to debt SCE purchases net short only for residences and small businesses if necessary PUC retains jurisdiction over rates EIX provides assurance to keep

existing PUC rates Dow Jones Story LOS ANGELES Dow JonesA plan that would put most of the burden of rescui ng embattled Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison on lar ge businesses has possibilities if it can gain stakeholder approval said Bo b Foster Edisons senior vice president of public affairs during a conferen ce call Tuesday The plan would have customers who use more than kilowatthours a month of electricity finance the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased on its behalf in the wholesale market The noncore customers would also help the utility recoup most of its billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the lowcost power the utility generates itself or has secured through longterm contracts Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys strongly supports the plan and has asked a former Sacramento mayor to help him take the temperature of Edison stakeholders to see if the approach has merit or can be acceptable Foste r said Some of the legislative leadership believes this is an attractive option i n both houses Foster said Business groups worry that the plan could cost the state billions in lost economic activity because it may force companies to relocate to other stat es The corenoncore proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers a s alternatives to a memorandum of understanding reached between Edison and Go v Gray Davis in April The MOU which would have the state buy the utilitys transmission lines has been pronounced dead by many in the legislature though Edison and Davis administration say they are still devoted to seeing it through

EARLY LAST OCTOBER every member of a ninth grade girls track team and the freshman the football team at suburban Houstons Deer Park High Schools north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems That day Deer Park registered parts of ozone per billion more than twice the federal standard and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States One of the biggest sources of Deer Parks pollution is a plant owned by Enron Houstons wealthiest company d and the single largest contributor and counting to the political ambitions of Texas Governor and Republican presidential nominee George W Bush Kenneth Lay the chief executive of Enron has personally given over to Bushs political campaigns more than any other individual He is one of Bushs Pioneers d elite fundraisers who have collected at least in direct contributions of or less for Dubya Enron is best known as the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country Its revenues of billion make it the th largest company in the United States Enron is invested in energy projects around the world including the UK Argentina Bolivia Brazil the Philippines Indonesia China India and Mozambique The company has recently expanded from energy to bandwidth capacity for the Internet making it one of the worlds largest Internetbased trading companies buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits Texas activists say that this tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill for the country if Bush is elected Andrew Wheat from Texans for Public Justice a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin compared the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the Governor to cogenerationa process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power In a more sinister form of cogeneration corporations are converting economic into political power Wheat explained A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could fill the White House with dangerous levels of Enron gas When that gas ignites in the publicpolicy arena consumers will get burned Indeed Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said that if elected president the governor is keen to promote the kind of policies that he has crafted with companies like Enron for the state of Texas The governor believes in competition free enterprise better service and technology improvements He has promoted sweeping and effective reforms in education and has been the first governor in Texas to seriously address limits on emissions He will carry his agenda to Washington to do what he believes is best for the country But is what Bush believes is good for Texas good for the United States Of America Texas has one of the worst environmental records in the country particularly in air pollution Unfortunately the Bush platform for the country is very similar to the kinds of programs that he has worked on with Enron d cutting corporate taxes deregulating industry and replacing social programs with private sector volunteerism In addition Enron is invested in energy projects around the globesome of which have been tainted by charges of human rights abuses In India construction of Enrons controversial Dhabol power plant has brought charges by international groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of complicity with police brutality in rural communities And according to Californiabased Amazon watch Enron is charged with human rights violations in Bolivia where it is building a major gas pipeline threatening indigenous communities and the rainforest environment Special deals The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the Houston Ship Channel area the nations largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city The Enron Methanol plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company to pollute without a permit as well as giving the company immunity from prosecution for violating the law Indeed plants like this in Texas actually emit twice as many nitrogen oxides a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together Only seven percent of the more than tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in were permitted Enron got away with this under the grandfather clause of the Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants built before to continue their polluting practices Governor Bush extended this clause under the Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise CARE program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May giving sweeping protections to polluters who perform internal environmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documents confidential from the public and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations To date Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission TNRCC the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plant is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron she says Its gotten so bad that NASA has a problem recruiting people to work here at Mission Control which is just down the road Houston is in trouble and George Bush is the reason d he has allowed the situation to deteriorate over the past several years according to Maschini Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that the companys contribution to local pollution is minimal If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he said Neil Carman a former employee of the Texas Air Control Board who now works for the Sierra Club agrees that Enrons grandfathered nitrogen emissions add up to less than one percent of the total for all of Texas However he points out that Enron Methanol plant alone contributes of the nitrogen oxide emissions from the nearly stationary sources of pollution for the city of Houston d the equivalent of cars Whats more he says that Enron is simply paying lip service to the Bush proposal to cut pollution at grand fathered plants Enron showed up at the governors press conference to volunteer for the CARE program but they have been missing in action ever since They havent even bothered to file their voluntary plan Giving and receiving If environmental regulators wanted to speak to Enrons senior officials about the missing voluntary program they would be well advised to follow the presidential candidate around as he is often chaperoned by Enron officials On April Ken Lay Enrons chief executive played host to Bush junior and his father former president George Bush at the Houston Astros first home game of the season at the baseball teams brand new stadium d Enron Field d which was built with the help of a million donation from Enron The company got free advertising a tax break and a million dollar contract to supply power to the stadium in return Less than three weeks later Lay joined Bush in Washington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering million easily the biggest onenight haul for any political party in history Thats not all Lay makes sure that the Bush presidential campaign has access to other Enron facilities Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country more times than any of the other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful Under federal law campaigns must reimburse companies for transportation typically at the cost of a firstclass ticket so Enron received from the Bush campaign for this favor Lays ties to Bush junior begin with his father former President George Bush who was also a recipient of EnronLays financial largesse Like his son now Bush senior was also happy to return the favor appointing Lay to the Presidents Export Council from to When asked about the relationship between the two men Ray Sullivan a spokesman for the Bush campaign chose his words carefully Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics He is chair of the Governors Business Council But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country Lay toed a similar line when recently interviewed by the New York Times When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for some special favor its not even for access d although Ill be the first to admit it probably helps access It is because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally Indeed both Lay and Enron are generous contributors to local and national politicians wherever they do business often following the long standing corporate practice of funding candidates on both sides of the election According to campaign records Enron and Lay have contributed to Democrats as diverse as Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro US Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis In Lay was Harris County chairman of a aplate ReaganBush fundraiser while at the same time cochairing a fundraiser for US Sen Lloyd Bentsen the vice presidential candidate on the opposing ticket Bush delivers just the kind of results that Lay wants Candidate Bush says he will work with local jurisdictions using marketbased solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and water He proposes allowing industries to voluntarily police themselves just like he did for Enron and the other polluters in Texas Texas has regularly ranked as the most environmentally polluted states in this country for years According to the Environmental Defense Fund Texas has the worst record of all states in air pollution water pollution overall toxic releases recognized carcinogens in the air suspected carcinogens in the air developmental toxins in the air affecting brain and nervoussystem development in children and cancer risk While it is true that Texas was the most polluted state in the country before George W Bush became governor the reason it has stayed that way is simple Bushs policies have effectively allowed these industries to continue to pollute through a system of voluntary compliance Read the fine print Ken Lay and Enrons political beliefs overlap with candidate Bush in other arenas such as education For example on August the Houston Astros will host a book drive at Enron Field to promote one of George W Bush and Enrons favorite charities d the Reach Out And Read ROAR literacy program Launched in by Laura Welch Bush the governors wife the program calls for physicians and nurse practitioners to give free culturally appropriate books to their preschool age patients at every checkup Enron also regularly volunteers its employees to read to children in area clinics and conducts book drives The cost to Enron for this five year publicity program was Susan Cooley the director of Texas ROAR was gushing in her support for the company the governor and his wife Ive been a nurse for years I dont know anything about sponsorship or advertising But at Enron they have whole departments to do this so finding a corporate sponsor has been a godsend she said However Enron is less than supportive of schools that do not provide similar public relations opportunities And its political reach goes beyond the governors mansion Some miles north of the companys headquarters in Houston Enron has effectively cut approximately from the annual budget of the Spring school district one of Houstons ethnically diverse poorer suburbs Spring Texas sits on top of Bammel Field a huge underground salt cave which Enron uses to store large quantities of natural gas As the largest business in Spring Enron was required to pay taxes based on the value of its property and mineral holdings on January st of each year But under a special provision Enron and other large business property owners were allowed to choose September st as their tax assessment date when the company has less gas stored in Bammel field Enron was able to reduce its property taxes by million in blowing a hole in the school districts budget according to Katherine Trumbull a tax accountant with the school district The Spring school district went to court to challenge the new tax provision as unconstitutional and won at the appeals court level Enron appealed this decision to the Texas Supreme Court While the case was pending Enrons Political Action Committee PAC and senior executives contributed heavily to the election campaigns of every Republican judges vying for seats all the members of the Texas Supreme Court are elected and may take money from contributors for the campaign expenses Enrons employees and PAC doled out between the seven of the winning justices in the campaign including more than from Ken Lay personally The Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously in Enrons favor on May a month after Lay gave Chief Justice Thomas Phillips for his campaign I have nothing against Enron after all they are our biggest taxpayer They can afford to pay for good lawyers and lobbyists and we cant says Trumbull simply Enrons Palmer had no comment about the tax lawsuit brought by the Spring Independent School District Enrons global muscle Enron has also courted Bushs help for its business abroad In March Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation to explain how export credit agencies of the United States are critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuing international projects in developing countries These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC a federal agency which provides political risk coverage and financial support to United States companies investing abroad d including hundreds of millions of dollars for Enron projects in countries from Brazil to India Unfortunately for communities in these countries Enrons investments have had devastating impact In India where Enron received million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol offshore oil and gas development project in the company has been blamed by both Human Rights Watch as well as Amnesty International for financing local police brutality Just before dawn on June police stormed the home of several women in Veldur a fishing village in western state of Maharashtra India The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road While dragging me the police kept beating me on my back with batons says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar a year old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest according to Amnesty International The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated my one and a half year old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away The only crime committed by these women was to lead a peaceful protest against a massive new Enron natural gas plant An investigative team from Amnesty International found that a number of the women subsequently sustained injuries including bruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legs Several hundred other peaceful protestors have been arrested and temporarily detained by Indian police since December according to the report Meanwhile a January investigation by Human Rights Watch revealed that the police were directly on the Enron payroll Likewise Enron has been severely criticized for the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project in Bolivia and Brazil for which it received US million in insurance from OPIC in On February an oil pipeline operated by Transredes a joint venture between Enron and Shell in the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project erupted in the Bolivian altiplano and dumped an estimated barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supports indigenous communities like the Uru Moratos Facing starvation from the loss of their life sustaining waterfowl and fish the Uru Moratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help TK result Mutual selfinterest In January Enron pitched in to help pay for Bushs inaugural bash in Austin Texas when he won the reelection for governor If George W wins this November it is very likely Ken Lay will be on hand when Bush is inaugurated as the next president of the United States hoping that in return for Lays generous campaign Support Bush will be equally generous in his support for Enrons businesses at home and abroad in the future Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice says that the relationship is bound to pay off Those two have a mutual selfinterest in being buddies Bush has always delivered on Ken Lays political pitches Enron depends upon government policies to enhance their bottom line in lots of ways The company relies upon this kind of access to government he recently told an Associated Press reporter It is people from the Uru Moratas of Bolivia to the school children of Deer Park and Spring Texas who will ultimately pay the price through the continued destruction of their communities and environment This story was made possible by the Corporate Watch Fund for

Monday The West desk would not give me any valuation estimates until Tim returned EES PTR Phase I Enron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers RAP The CPUC shined us on Later we ensured that it became part of ARMs case in PTR Phase I The way the cap worked the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high they would pay a credit that when added to the other bill components did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of money It was clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits Because of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW the UDCs settled with ARM on this issue in NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons Efforts Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in to extend the credit given for sales of green power The credit was scheduled to end by In the money specified in AB was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain took the lead in pressing for legislation We actively supported Green Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups working with envrionmental organizations and spearheading legislative amendments Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISOPX issues the green credit portion of the bill remained intact We had also decided jointly to propose a tenyear credit and were very pleased and surprised that it survived into the final bill Governor Davis is expected to sign the bill NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons Efforts RAP Enron through ARM has successfully made its case that retail procurement and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that all customers pay Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their bills in addition to the PX credit Enron was the first party to raise these issues as part of RAP and got a Commission decision in that case to determine the credit in RAP In RAP Enron chose to use ARM to litigate the case as a cheaper alternative Hearings were completed in the Spring of ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision An additional credit of from to MWh is expected The decision will be voted out within the next two months NPV estimted by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons Efforts ECT FTR Release April I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I joined the Company in Our long and painful fight with creeping nodalism culminated with the release of some but not all FTRs in April of this year ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs The new congestion management approach which Enron also spearheaded will require release of FTRs but will not take effect until next year This valuation looks only at the FTR release in NPV estimated by Tim Belden To be determined Attributed to Enrons Efforts ISO Price Caps ENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June Government Affairs working with Dave Parquet and others was instrumental in significantly delaying the movement to lower price caps thereby giving ENA time to move out of those positions The following events happened in We entered the year with a price cap of having fought to raise it to that level in In March the ISO considered lowering the price cap to but voted to leave it at because they believed at the time that market power had been adequately mitigated After the four very highpriced days in June the ISO considered lowering the price cap to with a vote on June but the vote failed by ONE VOTE Instead the Board lowered the price cap to The Board voted again on July to lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE Finally on August the Board approved the price cap effective August In June Government Affairs intitiated an allout lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose lower price caps We also lobbied interest groups banks venture capitalists NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board Members and the Board itself going so far as to set up a special arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board telephonically NPV estimated by Tim Belden To be determined Attributed to Enrons Efforts New MarketOriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time Government Affairs actively sought marketoriented individuals to run for the Board and replace those that do not support competitive markets Enron was successful in getting about five to run The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats However one seat of interest has been decided Dave Parquet suggested a potential municipal representative who was extremely marketoriented Michael Wood City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh Government Affairs worked with him closely to decide which seat to run for help him prepare his application suggest lobbying tactics assist in lobbying and support him with other Board Members He won the election and became a Board Member in early September This effort is significant because the munis voted nearly in support of lower price caps The position he took was one of those votes All other things being equal we have now added a vote on our side that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or additional price caps given the close votes that have taken place thus far NPV estimated based on Tim Beldens Pice Cap Assessment To be determined Attibuted to Enrons Efforts

Also includes changes to the writeups for ENA and what I got from Tim Belden I also have a note discussing Tim Beldens philosophy in giving me valuations EES RAP Enron raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers during the very first proceedings during which the method of CTC collection was raised The CPUC shined us on Later we raised it in the very first Revenue Adjustment Proceeding RAP RAP and ensured that it became part of WPTFs case as well The way the cap worked the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high they would pay a credit that when added to the other bill components did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer thereby costing ESPs a lot of money potentially It was clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits Because of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW the UDCs settled on this issue in NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in to extend the credit given for sales of green power The credit was scheduled to end by In the money specified in AB was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain took the lead in pressing for legislation We actively supported Green Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups working with environmental organisations and spearheading legislative amendments Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISOPX issues the green credit portion of the bill remained intact We had also decided jointly to propose a tenyear credit and were very pleased and surprised that it survived into the final bill Governor Davis is expected to sign the bill NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts RAP Enron through ARM has successfully made its case that retail procurement and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that all customers pay Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their bills in addition to the PX credit Enron was the first party to raise these issues as part of RAP and got a Commission decision in that case to determine the credit in RAP In RAP Enron chose to use ARM to litigate the case as a cheaper alternative Hearings were completed in the Spring of ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision An additional credit of from to MWh is expected The decision will be voted out within the next two months NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts San Diego Marketing Government Affairs worked closely with EES origination to help the staff understand the wildly fluctuating regulatory and political arena in San Diego and to assist its efforts to take advantage of the unique marketing opportunity afforded by volatile wholesale market prices EES created a new Enron milestone Beginning at a point with no personnel working on San Diego deals EES moved in and was able to sign deals worth million in three weeks time EES has received kudos from the highest levels of Enron for this effort which continues today Martin Wenzel and Doug Condon of EES origination have stated their belief that these deals would not have happened with the assistance of Government Affairs NPV estimated by Doug Condon million and growing Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts ENA Note Tim Belden VP West Trading Desk discussed with me how these valuations would be used He found it difficult to assess Gov Affairs contribution to the ENA dollars made In the end he settled on the concept that Government Affairs works sometimes for years to present ENA with an opportunity to make money and then it is up to ENA to run with it So the value Tim provides is the value ENA made with the opportunity I think this is consistent with the way Dennis Benevides calculated the value for me FTR Release April I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I joined the Company in When I joined Enron the plan of market participants was to have financialonly rights I began working immediately to move people in the direction of physical rights A very long and painful fight ensued including a number of personal appearances by Bill Hogan This culminated with an ISO decision to have physicaltype FTRs and to release some but not all FTRs in April of this year ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs The new congestion management approach which Enron also spearheaded will require release of FTRs but will not take effect until next year This valuation looks only at the FTR release in NPV estimated by Tim Belden million Attributed to Enrons Efforts ISO Price Caps Price caps have been discussed in California beginning a few days after the market opened in April Over the course of the last two years Government Affairs had as a number one priority to provide rapid advance information on price caps educate Board members on the effects of price caps and when appropriate work to move price caps By June ENA had a substantial long position in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June Government Affairs working with Dave Parquet and others was instrumental in delaying the movement to lower price caps by six weeks thereby giving ENA time to move out of those positions in an orderly fashion The following events happened in We entered the year with a price cap of having fought to raise it to that level in In March the ISO considered lowering the price cap to but voted to leave it at because the Board believed at the time that market power had been adequately mitigated After the three very highpriced days in June the ISO considered lowering the price cap to with a vote on June Government Affairs initiated an allout lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose lower price caps We also lobbied interest groups banks venture capitalists NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board Members and the Board itself going so far as to set up a special arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board telephonically The vote on June failed by ONE VOTE Instead the Board lowered the price cap to The Board voted again on July to lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE Finally on August the Board approved the price cap effective August In the end it was the enduse customers Enron and the generators who opposed price caps Utilities and munis favored them Enron was the only party lobbying against the lower price caps the generators gave up early in the fight and had significant credibility with the enduse customer reps on the Board NPV estimated by Tim Belden million Attributed to Enrons Efforts New MarketOriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time Government Affairs actively sought marketoriented individuals to run for the Board and replace those that do not support competitive markets Enron was successful in getting about five to run The Members selected or confirmed by the EOB have been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats However one seat of interest has been decided Dave Parquet suggested a potential municipal representative who was extremely marketoriented Michael Wood Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh Government Affairs worked with him closely to decide which seat to run for help him prepare his application suggest lobbying tactics assist in lobbying and support him with other Board Members He won the election and became a Board Member in early September This effort is significant because the munis voted nearly in support of lower price caps The position he took was one of those votes All other things being equal we have now added a vote on our side that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or additional price caps given the close votes that have taken place thus far NPV Tim did not feel this is measurable at this time but agreed it could be worth millions if future votes are as close as they have been Attributed to Enrons Efforts

being created California Utilities Losses On Electricity Pose Risk By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some point you have a financial crisis The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The California utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility that serves one out of every Americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by billion It is borrowing million while Edison is tapping million from the commercial paper market This is going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief financial officer for Southern California Edison Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March which opened electricity pricing to competition California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system To do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By the end of this June PGE and Edison together had collected more than billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March deadline set by the legislature At that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE that analysts expect its deficit to exceed billion by Oct more than half its shareholder equity of billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of billion The utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of they get clobbered That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds could total million while in Edisons case the amount is million Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock The utility serving that city San Diego Gas Electric Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers Legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors corporate ratings group But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare Californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds Nevertheless several forces are working against them Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need If they dont buy enough the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison though is one of timing The California legislature is out of session until December and regulators havent even really started to address the issue formally In the meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily Write to Rebecca

his comments Hoecker asks Congress to give FERC retroactive refund authority By the way this article is wrong about the refund effective date The current refund effective date is days from the date FERCs order was published in the Federal Register It was pushed on August so if in a future order the Commission were to require refunds they would be calculated beginning October th Forwarded by Mary HainHOUECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoeckers Congressional Testimony Law changes needed for retroactive refunds FERCS Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Date October FERC Chairman James Hoecker D told a congressional panel that the commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against market power in a competitive environment Hoecker also urged the congressmen to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility industrys transition to competition Hoeckers plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California where some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this summer Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the states bulk power markets it is clear that currently the commission does not have that authority to do so retroactively The Federal Power Act would have to be changed a FERC staffer says For its own study which began in August Hoecker claimed that the commission if proven necessary would consider ordering refunds if market participants were indeed price gouging However the Federal Power Act FPA the law that gives the commission much of its authority does not consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is probably needed to see if the commission can do that If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept If market power is being exercised we will respond accordingly by revoking or modifying marketbased rates or reassuring the basis upon which we grant them We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA if refunds are justified by record evidence However the FPA defines the commissions authority and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures with California and other states Currently the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions made days after the commission initiates an investigation which in this case would be Oct However the law makes no mention of retroactive ratemaking and FERC officials admit that to do so the law needs to be changed Based upon what I know the authority of the commission to issue refunds for any period before days following our investigation order is highly problematic Commissioner William Massey D told Electric Power Alert There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that it would be unlawful and we would need legislation to do that The Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep Dan Burton RIN held a midafternoon Sept hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a severe energy crisis this winter The committee heard testimony from Hoecker Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Carol Browner Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets but both Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year Richardson expressed his disappointment that nothing passed while Hoecker claimed that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United States under the same rules for nondiscriminatory open access and comparable service Hoecker said The commissions open access rules are not binding on the part of the nations transmission system owned or controlled by entities other than public utilities Open access over the facilities of public power and other nonpublic utilities would promote greater competition in wholesale markets by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers and sellers Hoecker pointed to FERCs investigation into bulk power markets and Californias energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives clear legislative direction FERC will extremely limited in what it could do to solve the market problems Congress too has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices Hoecker said Most critically events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate investment in generation and transmission facilities and higher levels of reliability which is crucial to the digital economy The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability standards Currently the House is considering a bill that would make the commission a federal backstop for reliability but most congressional sources do not expect the bill to pass see related story source Electric Power Alert date October issue Vol No title FERCs Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Inside Washington Publishers

Senator Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornias power costs surged this summer not because of a supply shortage but because power suppliers were able withhold generation until the last possible moment and command exorbitantly high prices State Sen Steve Peace said in a letter sent to federal regulators In the letter dated Oct and obtained by Dow Jones Newswires the senator one of the architects of deregulation in the state charges that the states power market was collusively structured and pleads with federal regulators to take action against instate generation owners for unlawful behavior Peace DChula Vista compared the states power market to a World Wrestling Federation match saying it only had the appearance of competition A WWF bout has all of the surface elements associated with competition but the outcome is driven by a script rather than by the spontaneous consequences of competition Peace says in the letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Chairman James Hoecker Similarly participants in the wholesale electric market are not responding to market signals they are simply following a script written to satisfy the most naive and simplistic believers in markets The federal agency is expected to release its findings on the causes of the states power crisis by December State energy officials are conducting their own investigation of the summers

costs to Californias retail electricity consumers and threeinvestor owned utilities States Pwr Grid Operator Says Demand Outstripped Supply Peaces claim that California didnt have an electricity supply problem this summer contradicts a report by the California Independent System Operator the states grid operator which concluded that demand did outstrip supply These guys arent in the control room ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said of doubters in a previous interview How would they know If FERC uncovers evidence that California indeed faced no supply shortage this summer the result could be severe penalties for all market participants a FERC spokeswoman said The senator offered no such evidence in his letter but said In every case and in every declared emergency supplies have been adequate to meet load A conclusion that supply was short would leave FERC with little alternative but to return the market to costbased rates until the supply shortage is corrected the senator wrote The senator urged FERC not to conclude that the problems in the wholesale market would best be solved by eliminating the states main power market the CalPX and moving to exclusively bilateral trade Such a result would be disastrous Peaces letter states The commission should keep in mind those who have manipulated the wholesale market are those who would prefer that all transactions be engaged in secret But the senator did ask that the stakeholder boards of the CalPX and the ISO be replaced In addition the senator is reportedly drafting legislation that would fold the CalPX into the ISO and may result in the closure of the CalPXs Alhambra trading floor sources close to the senator said CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo said the nonprofit exchange is operating exactly as the Legislature intended and that any overhaul would need the approval of the governor The California Municipal Utilities Association a lobbying group representing the interests of about municipal utilities in the

Friday June PM ET Email this article to a friend Printerfriendly version LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market Duke Energy DUK news msgs Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and Reliant Energy Inc REI news msgs have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power the ability to influence electricity prices in Californias wholesale power market The ISO which manages the states highvoltage transmission system recently made a similar filing against AES Corp AES news msgs and Williams Cos WMB news msgs claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators authority to charge marketbased rates for their power supply Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations Weve obviously just got the filing and were reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing But were also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down Williams said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said the ISOs allegations are nothing new Its similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators Wheatley said The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing Steve Maviglio press secretary to Gov Gray Davis said the governor strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June Dynegys ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy companys production costs The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars retroactive to May of the difference between costbased ratesand the market revenues actually received Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke Reliant and Mirant The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged according to the filing In the filing generators have also been accused of megawattlaundering in which suppliers sell power outofstate that is resold to California at a higher price California consumers have spent billion for wholesale electricity in billion in and could pay as much as billion this year Charles Robinson the ISOs chief counsel said he is optimistic the state will prevail in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief were seeking He said FERC should implement an effective market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices FERC set up a market mitigation plan which went into effect June to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below Robinson said that plan wasnt good enough Wholesale power prices were at a sevenmonth low Thursday due in part to the new FERC plan cooler temperatures low naturalgas prices and conservation measures energy officials said Every three years FERC reviews generators ability to charge market rates for electricity Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices

centered around the budget conference committee hearing as the deadline to pass the states budget is next Friday June th Also today was the last day for bills to pass out of their house of origin and sent to the other house for legislative hearings This weeks energy highlights include the following EVENTS Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta Lynch urging that Californias petroleum refineries and ancillary facilities be exempt from rotating outages The basis for the governors letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum products for several weeks The availability of petroleum derived transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of Californians Public safety agencies such as law enforcement emergency medical care responders and the military all rely on these fuels Without petroleum fuels the ability of these essentialuse customers to perform their critical functions would be seriously impaired said Governor Davis Governor Davis along with top executives and business leaders in the state announce a jointDeclaration on Thursday committed to saving percent in overall electricity consumption With more than businesses and organizations statewide this energyconservation coalition sets the following goals among others to reduce energy use set temperatures for occupied space to degrees from May to October reduce lighting levels by percent and an additional percent upon the declaration of a Stage II emergency close blinds and shades when possible and turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay percent of back payments to some alternativeenergy generators The PUC postponed their vote to June on a proposal that would allow alternative generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it from PGE and Edison to remain in business The California State Senate Rules Committee in cooperation with the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further background information in its investigation into whether generators are illegally profiteering from the states power crisis Eight outofstate generating companies and perhaps eventually the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the state Department of Water Resources stand to receive papers demanding

assessment authority over electricgenerating facilities back to the state Board of Equalization thereby nullifying Rule Although the author asserted that her bill will not take away muchneeded tax revenue from cities and counties AB is considered a huge disincentive and unfair tax on current and potential electric generating companies in the state IEP testified against this bill in committee and will continue to oppose this bill in the Senate Assembly Member Cohn DSaratoga gains Assembly approval on Wednesday with AYES and NOES for her resolution asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose interim price caps until the California power market has stabilized Assembly Joint Resolution AJR specifically states that price caps be put in place at least until California is able to bring new energy supplies online and for the states massive conservation efforts to take effect The resolution asserts that California believes not enough has been done by the FERC to investigate price gouging by generators and control wholesale electricity prices and calls upon the federal regulatory agency to adhere to its governing statutes its vision statement and its own regulations for companies seeking marketbased authority Path study bill passes out of the full Assembly on Tuesday with unanimous support from both sides with AYES and NOES If passed by the Senate AB

this weekend ENERGY CRUNCH Direct access falls victim to crisis Powerbuying plans future is in doubt Bernadette Tansey Greg Lucas Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNLDTL The option to shop around for the best deal on electricity one of the cornerstones of Californias deregulation plan could soon be scrapped Businesses may lose the right to cut their own deals with private power suppliers and environmentally conscious consumers could be barred from shifting their business from utilities to renewable energy firms unless the Legislature acts quickly to save the program The potential cost savings of socalled direct access to competing electricity providers was the plum that incited big businesses to fight hard for deregulation in But the program although it was not responsible for the soaring rates that piled up state and utility debt may be sacrificed in the states drive to recoup its costs The fate of the program was thrown into doubt last winter when skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs collapsed the nascent direct access market weakened the utilities and caused the state to take over power purchases Industry has been lobbying hard since then to keep the option open for the future But the problem for Gov Gray Davis administration is that the state needs big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers to help pay off the billion it has already spent buying power and the estimated billion worth of power it has contracted to buy over the next years Otherwise the utility customers left behind householders and small businesses will be stuck with the whole bill Competing proposals to allow companies to bail out by paying an exit fee to cover a share of the cost are working their way through the Legislature But time is running short state Treasurer Philip Angelides warned the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission this month The state plans to issue billion in bonds in September for power purchases and officials say underwriters want to be assured that there is a large enough revenue stream to repay the bonds Angelides and other state officials urged the Legislature and the PUC to decide by the end of June either to ban direct access or lock in a procedure to charge each departing company for its share of the state power costs The hypothetical and theoretical desires for a direct access market and the hypothetical and theoretical desire for a bond sale are now intersecting in reality said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Santa Cruz County Industry advocates agree that firms should pay a fair share of the electricity purchased on their behalf But how much and how to make that calculation is a complex issue they fear will be decided in haste said Dorothy Rothrock a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association We are reacting to crises real or manmade and making decisions in a rush without considering the consequences Rothrock said The PUC is set to vote Thursday on a proposed urgency measure to suspend direct access as of July The ban recommended by a PUC administrative law judge would continue as long as the state functions as power buyer for utility customers conceivably through the term of state contracts ending in Lawmakers had authorized the PUC to suspend direct access last winter when the state took over electricity purchasing But a divided PUC delayed action as legislators worked with industry to salvage the program Although direct access contracts are still legal until the PUC acts in effect the program was slammed into suspension by the brutal power price hikes of the past months Threatened by exposure to rising wholesale electricity rates virtually all direct access customers have returned to the utilities where they are protected by the state rate freeze Even though the right to deal directly with generators has been on the books since few businesses or householders actually did it Many of the residential customers who signed on with alternative suppliers did so to support the growth of renewable power like solar and wind energy At its peak the program drew about households about percent of the customer base of Californias major utilities About percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power Industry has until tomorrow to file plans with the PUC to preserve direct access under a proposal by public utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas a strong supporter of the program Commissioner Jeff Brown said he favors direct access but the continuing uncertainty over the form it would take jeopardizes the states ability to float its bonds Commissioner Carl Wood a direct access opponent said it should be abolished because it creates a danger that residential and small business customers will be stuck paying for relatively highcost contracts secured by the state during the energy crisis while large industries would be free to buy cheap power from the newer more efficient plants that will be coming online in the next few years But Wood said even if the PUC suspends the option the state Legislature could order its reinstatement Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey is carrying a bill to do that while requiring the exit fees demanded by Angelides and state finance officials Without those safeguards utility revenues would dive into a death spiral where rates would keep rising as more companies abandoned the system Bowen said giving the remaining customers a deeper incentive to bail State legislators are set to meet this week to start deciding how Californias electricity market should be structured in the future But deadlines to deal with the states financial hangover are pushing decisions on direct access Bowen said its unlikely her bill will be passed within a few weeks the time frame Davis administration officials have urged to give certainty to the terms of the bond deal Angelides said the Legislature could still pass a law reviving direct access before the bond language is written in July But after that the Legislature cannot pass laws that change the terms of contract commitments made by the state he said There is still a window to act here but they have to act fast Angelides said Email Bernadette Tansey at and Greg Lucas at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

RadioMike Ward PacSat News Satellite NGI Daily Junepdf rtpdf Even better than expected Published Wednesday June in the San Jose Mercury News EDITORIAL The opinion of the Mercury News PUC should keep consumers plugged in to power choices AT the beginning the restructured California electricity market was supposed to include competition among sellers of electricity offering green power or cheaper power not just competition among generators As things played out retail competition was nearly smothered Now with the state buying electricity on behalf of utilities it could take a further blow State officials are leery of letting customers go to other suppliers now that the state will buy huge amounts of electricity over the next decade The Public Utilities Commission Thursday might suspend direct access the ability of consumers large and small to cut their own deals with electricity suppliers instead of being forced to buy through the stateutilities The PUC should leave it alone Instead the Legislature should continue discussing ways of revitalizing direct access without leaving the state with longterm contracts and not enough customers Ultimately the state should get out of the electricity business Keeping retail competition alive is one avenue of escape Theres a slightly negative zinger at the very end but overall a balanced story Published Wednesday June in the San Jose Mercury News CALIFORNIAS ENERGY CRISIS PUC likely to call a halt to shopping for power BY MICHAEL BAZELEY mailto AND JOHN WOOLFOLK mailto Mercury News State regulators Thursday are expected to pull the plug on electricity deregulations core feature the ability of customers to shop around for alternative power After July residential and business customers would no longer be allowed to shop for a new electricity provider under a measure expected to be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission State leaders fear that after stepping in and buying premiumpriced power to avoid blackouts this year big businesses will flee for a better deal sticking small consumers with the governments energy bill Those consumers would then face higher rates causing even more to flee You create a death spiral said Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach Business leaders alternative energy providers and some state officials are desperately trying to head off the move saying theyve saved a bundle on energy through the direct access option of bypassing the major utilities While were coping with the rate increase we think direct access is the best way for us to manage the cost of energy said Dominic DiMare legislative advocate of the California Chamber of Commerce It leads to market discipline as well as innovation DiMare said Supporters argue the state which approved a record billion in bonds to cover power costs can guarantee payment without killing off customer choice They backed an alternative proposal Tuesday by utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas in which customers would pay a charge to cover the states energy bonds regardless of their electricity provider Customers already pay similar charges to cover an array of costs from nuclear decommissioning to conservation programs It still gives people the opportunity to buy energy that might not necessarily be cheaper but that meets their needs more said Rick Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which markets power from renewable sources such as solar and wind But even Bilas gives his proposal long odds of approval saying If I were a betting man hed say his plan would go down The ability to shop for power was the impetus for the states deregulation bill The architects of deregulation led by business groups believed that if customers could buy power directly from producers it would promote competition and drive down prices It never happened Wholesale power costs soared and that along with a host of other issues drove companies out of the state forcing tens of thousands of consumers back into the arms of utilities Now though with significantly higher electric rates going into effect this month choice is looking more attractive than ever to big businesses Joined by alternative power companies they are trying to push a bill through the Legislature that would set up a framework for continued choice Manufacturers live and die by the ability to cut costs said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association If they have an opportunity to save money we dont feel theres any reason that should be taken away That type of freedom raises a host of thorny issues The state is now buying power on behalf of utilities and entering into dozens of longterm power contracts If businesses and residential users flee the system the state could be left with a surplus of costly power and fewer users to pay for it That in turn could mean higher rates for the remaining users Bowen is trying to address these issues in a bill that would make customers pay when they leave the system Her bill also would allow users to go into the market only during annual enrollment periods and it would limit the amount of power that could be bought on the open market Business groups are fighting those provisions Contact Michael Bazeley at mailto or Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide NGI Daily Junepdf rtpdf

direct access in California Edelman worked with Bernadette Tansey on this article and provided her with information on AReM and the DA coalitions goals as well as background on direct access We are also currently working with the Chronicles Editorial board to secure an editorial Bush appointee warns state PUC on direct access FERC panelist wants consumers to retain choice of energy firms Zachary Coile Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL Washington President Bushs key federal energy regulator warned California that it may hurt consumers if the state approves a proposal to bar power users from shopping around for the best prices for electricity Patrick Wood a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Bushs liaison to the state on energy issues criticized a plan before the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend a major element of the states deregulation plan Called direct access the program allows businesses to cut deals with private power suppliers and permits consumers to choose among competing electricity providers including firms that market renewable sources of energy Members of the state PUC which had been set to consider the issue today said yesterday that they will delay the vote on direct access until Tuesday at the urging of Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks Wood who met with state PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch during a twoday trip to California earlier this week said he fears that ending direct access will lock consumers into higher energy prices I do worry about the future of retail competition he said yesterday in Washington I think a lot of things theyre trying to do to resolve todays problem may really push off the benefits of direct access for quite a few years Im really concerned about that At the same time Wood stressed that the federal regulators would not try to override the commissions and Legislatures decision Its their call Its a state prerogative he said The state PUC is expected to suspend direct access Tuesday because the state needs all energy users especially big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers and help pay off the billion the state has already spent on energy and billion more worth of power bought through longterm contracts Lynch said the PUC must act soon because state Treasurer Phil Angelides has warned that allowing direct access to continue without restrictions would threaten the states ability to sell billion in bonds to pay for the power purchases If some customers are allowed to desert the utilities and buy power from competitors fewer ratepayers would be left to pay off the bonds And the remaining utility customers would be stuck covering the huge costs racked up during the energy crisis We need to be sure the bonds are issued Lynch said Even though direct access has been allowed since few businesses or householders actually did it At its peak the program drew about households about percent of the customer base of Californias major utilities About percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power When the state took over buying power for the cashstrapped utilities in January the Legislature directed the PUC to suspend the direct access program LAST CHANCE FOR DIRECT ACCESS Still Hertzberg asked Lynch to delay the PUCs vote on direct access until next week so legislators who back the program can try to save it in a deal that would still provide a steady stream of revenue for the bonds Were looking at options as a lastditch effort Hertzberg said If the PUC had made the decision to suspend direct access that would have had a chilling effect on anything we want to do Wood a champion of energy deregulation said he believes that California should not abandon its effort to increase competition by allowing customers more choices about where they get their power Deregulation always benefits people he said If it doesnt youve got to rework it until it does WARNING FROM CHAIRMANTOBE Wood a softspoken Texan who is expected to become the regulatory commission chairman this fall praised California leaders for their efforts to address the crisis including getting new plants built quickly But in meetings this week he cautioned Gov Gray Davis and other state leaders against trying to punish the generators for alleged past wrongs I think the rhetoric is still pretty hot out there he said If I were a generator looking at states talking about a windfall profits tax and expropriation of property its not a great climate for investing in new plants Zachary Coile reported from the Chronicles Washington bureau with Bernadette Tansey in San Francisco Sacramento Bureau Chief Greg Lucas also contributed from Sacramento Email the writers at and

is this weeks legislative report Republicans are still voting against the states spending budget citing a tax increase of onequarter of a cent in the states sales tax Without a state budget in place essential state services cannot be done such as issuing checks to many contractors as well as to lawmakers legislative staffers constitutional officers and administration appointees Civil service workers will still be able to recover their paychecks however trial courts do not appear to collect any state funds to cover payroll and administrative costs Meanwhile this weeks energyrelated events and legislative highlights include EVENTS Two new whistleblowers from the former San Diego Gas Electric Company came forth on Thursday morning alleging further accusations of price manipulation and unsafe working conditions by Duke Energy These two former employees were introduced at a press conference by Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante and Assembly Member Barbara Matthews to further expand upon testimony provided by three former Duke employees last week Meanwhile the Senate Energy Price Manipulation Select Committee chaired by Senator Joe Dunn DSanta Ana will meet this upcoming Tuesday and vote on contempt citations against generators Mirant and Enron who failed to comply with subpoenas for documents According to the committee six other suppliers of energy AES Williams Reliant Dynegy Duke and ERG have until Tuesday to turn over documents The state PUC cancelled its continuation meeting on Tuesday dealing with the suspension of the right of retail end users of electricity to acquire service from providers other than the DWR or a public entity and any other items relating to the DWRs Power Supply Revenue Bonds Written letters received by the Department of Finance State Treasurers Office and the DWR all urged the PUC to postpone its hearing until midAugust so that interested parties can resolve their issues State Controller Connell released unedited versions of billion worth of power contracts with power generators negotiated by the governors energy consultants on Monday These contracts specifically state which companies are selling energy to the state as well as at what cost the duration of the contract and from where the energy is generated Further information released includes reference to millions of dollars already paid towards the longterm energy contracts in addition to the million for special energy consultants to the governor Connell says that the contracts were negotiated at the worst possible times for higher prices and longer periods than necessary The CalISO acknowledged on Monday responsibility for swings in the electrical production at a power plant owned by Duke Energy This is significant because Duke had been the subject of allegation of market manipulation by former employees in Senator Dunns surprise committee hearing last week In a document to its oversight board the ISO states records show that Duke merely was following its orders to adjust output to help balance the statewide grid and not drive up prices Governor Davis announced late last Friday that Mark Fabiani will no longer serve as one of his strategic communications consultants keeping Chris Lehane as his communications consultant with a salary equal to former Communications Director Phil Trounstine Mr Lehane will continue to provide

San Diego surcharge Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Dan Douglass AM To ARM cc Subject Resolution E Approved The Commission approved Resolution E on a vote at the July meeting A copy of the final resolution which has several changes from t he draft issued a few weeks ago is attached for your information The Resolution explicitly states that DA customers are exempt from the AB rate surcharge as AReM advocated in its July comments It also states that any DA customer returning to bundled service will not be exempt from the surcharge However a subsequent return to DA appears to make the customer exempt again The following are some excerpts from the Resolutio n relating to these issues Two parties filed comments on the recirculated resolution SDGE and AR M both on July Some of the implementation issues raised by SDGE require clarifications as discussed in the remainder of this section SDGE next maintains that the draft Resolution resolves two issues that instead should be resolved in A and A changes in the definition of small customers and the treatment of DA customers We note that the Commission has not publicly issued a Proposed Decision or draft Alternate Decision in those proceedings addressing the treatment of DA customers or the definition of small customers With respect to the treatment of DA customers we see no reason why it is improper to address that issue here as that issue has been addressed by t he participants in this informal proceeding Accordingly we determine that D A customers are exempt from recovery of the undercollection that results from the AB energy price ceiling based only on the record established for this Resolution That is we base this determination on relevant information contained in protests and responses to protests on the advice letters addressed by this Resolution and comments and reply comments on drafts of this Resolution that were circulated for public comment SDGE also asserts in its July comments that the draft Resolution finds DA Issues moot but addresses them anyway SDGE also argues that it withdrew AL E and that the draft Resolution inappropriately addressed two issues exempting DA customers from any future cost recovery obligations associated with AB rate ceiling benefits and determining what the obligations are of DA customers who return to utility bundled service SDGE also maintains that the Resolution must be revised to avoi d gaming by customers who attempt to avoid paying their share of the undercollection We first note that the draft Resolution clearly noted at page the continued relevance of DA issues despite SDGEs withdrawal of AL E The passage of Assembly X and the potential for the Commission to suspe nd Direct Access reduce the potential for gaming With no individual tracking missmatches between benefits and repayment obligations are inevitable Limiting rate ceiling cost recovery responsibility to bundled service customers is an expedient way to mitigate such mismatches and is supported in the discussion section of the resolution by the ADJs intent to not discriminate against DA customers SDGE states in its July comments that the draft Resolution must be changed to clearly state that customers cannot avoid paying for costs simp ly by switching back and forth between bundled service and DA and that the only customers who will avoid paying for costs are those who never caused them to be incurred in the first place But the reverse could also be true Some DA customers that were returned to bundled service in early not having received the largest part of the rate ceiling benefit might have the same repayment obligations as bundled SDGE customers that received the benefit back to June as well as those that just move in to SDGE service territory when the benefit ends and the repayment begins We do not address these issues in this Resolution In the Resolution we determined that the complexity of individual tracking at this point is likely to outweigh its benefits ARM in its comments on the recirculated resolution supports the order that DA customers should not be liable for any SDGE undercollection balancing account However ARM proposes a single change to the draft Resolution regarding the treatment of customers who spend some time on a nd sometime off direct access DA and who find themselves for whatever reason off DA when SDGE recovers undercollections arising from AB If the Commission is unwilling to require individual customer tracking an d if these customers are for whatever reason off DA when SDGE assesses undercollection obligations arising from AB the Commission should trea t them as DA customers We will not adopt ARMs proposal on this record Customers in the position described by ARM would have at least received a portion of the rate ceilin g benefits and are not differently situated from new customers in the SDGE service territory ARM argues that a DA customer who has not received the benefit of the rate cap has not contributed to the utilitys purchased power undercollectio n If that customer later finds herself for whatever reason on bundled service and subject to the AB rate cap she should be liable for her share of undercollections incurred during the period when she was on bundl ed service But since SDGE contends that it cannot support individual tracking ARM proposes that customers that were DA during the period since June be exempt from the repayment obligations As further support ARM also cites the ACR issued on July in A seeking comments by July on a proposed settlement of pending litiga tion between the Commission and SDGE As part of the settlement SDGE would write off million plus interest from its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue Shortfall Account ERCRSA where SDGE tracks AB undercollections ARM notes that the proposed writeoff would benefit bundled customers but not DA customers ARM contends that if the Commission were to adopt the proposed settlem ent of pending litigation DA customers below kW would lose out on the ir share of the million write off That is the very kind of discrimination described in the Assembly Daily Journal and the draft Resolution seeks to guard against such inequities In view of th e harm that would be imposed on DA customers if the Commission were to adopt the settlement and to simultaneously avoid tracking individual AB benefits ARMargues that the Commission should direct that any customer who was ever a DA customer be exempt from cost recovery obligations associated with AB rate ceiling benefits As

Kelly Email Katie Kaplan Email Jean Munoz Email Andy Brown Email Carol Hudson Email Sandra Moseley Email Subject RE Legislative Report Dear all Attached is this weeks legislative report This entire week has been focused on devising a solution for the energy crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget Although the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the budget on Monday the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucial trailer bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill There are approximately trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget bill but have raised concerns for the Republicans SB Transportation Funding Shift SB Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs SB Omnibus Health Trailer Bill AB Public Social Services and SB Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill Senate President pro Tempore John Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly As of pm tonight there is no budget deal Meanwhile on the energy front the four proposals we have been discussing all week SB xx Burton SB xx Polanco AB xx Keeley and AB xx Wright are still in play legislatively this evening even though the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly and Senate to stay in session despite the scheduled summer break until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature SB xx Polanco Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES The originally introduced version of SB xx reflected the terms of the original Memorandum of Understanding MOU negotiated between Governor Davis and Southern California Edison Edison It was recently amended to reflect Senator Shers proposed Plan B of the MOU a version of the MOU opposed by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy It was heard in the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Wednesday where it failed on a AYES and NOES vote Reconsideration was granted however and the bill passed out of the committee with AYES and NOES on Thursday morning The authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause changing the rate component from KWs to KWs placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section which insulated Edison International from certain claims during the Thursday hearing SB xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday with AYES and NOES SB xx Burton Department of Water Resources electricity bond financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower cheaper rate than allotted in AB x Keeley assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill is signed by Governor Davis The bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and requires certain sunshine provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the DWR We understand that JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering have advised the governors office that SB xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed The bill was heard by the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a AYES and NOES vote It next must be heard in the Assembly AB xx Keeley Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening on a AYES and NOES vote It was then heard later the same evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee where it was passed on a AYES and NOES vote This is the compromise bill we have been discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred Keeley The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full Assembly possibly later this evening The current version of the bill provides for limited direct access state purchase of Edisons transmission lines for billion a minimum percent haircut for the major generators and a trust to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option AB xx Wright Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of was amended into AB xx by Assembly Member Bill Campbell in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening and then passed out of committee with AYES and NOES It next must be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee barring a rule waiver No such committee hearing is scheduled at this time Coauthored by Assembly Members Rod Wright Keith Richman Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection among other things Other energyrelated developments this week include SB xx Burton State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NO and sent to the Assembly This bill provides million from the state General Fund to the California Energy Commission CEC to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals The grant program will be administered by the CEC in consultation with local governments and will provide percent of the cost of the battery backup system It next must be heard in the Assembly The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday the FERC announced on Friday Despite a Dec FERC order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the ISO the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the states domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities SB xx Burton Electrical restructuring rates passed out of the full Senate on Thursday with AYES and NOES This bill bars the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC from raising rates back to the pre percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on March It next must be heard in the Assembly The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies trading practices The resolution SR passed out with AYES and NOES The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texasbased Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents Despite Reliants having handed over documents the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of Reliants documents The committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents The contempt citation against Reliant will be presented to the full Senate and then immediately sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts Dunn said The states estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from billion to billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment in the states figure on Wednesday Although the state continues to argue that the billion figure is correct FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called the figure baseless and criticized the California delegation for not negotiating in good faith during the recent settlement discussions The new amount billion does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers two entities that do not fall under the purview of the ISO PX or the state DWR as well as applies FERC price controls imposed June and retroactively takes into account sales from October onward AB xx Migden Electrical restructuring Oversight Board ISO passed out of the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with AYES and NOES It was amended by the author in committee to doublejoin it to SB xx see below This amendment ties the ultimate fate of AB xx to the fate of AB xx unless the doublejoiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature assuming the bill gets to the governor SB xx Speier Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with AYES and NOES Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author Given the failure of SB xx in committee AB xx is effectively dead as well for the moment see discussion of AB xx above Best regards Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez

weeks legislative report for IEP Despite the summer break leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a rescue plan for Southern California Edison The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you In short the new plan called for amending SB xx and AB xx to among other things provide for a dedicated rate component to support a billion bond financing by Edison but would have prevented Edison from using the funds to pay generators PX and ISO invoices directly or indirectly The billion could be used to pay QFs The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years and then apply solely to noncore customers Additionally under the plan the haircuttrust account concept was deleted the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison the RPS targeted a growth in new generating capacity through and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday July and committee and floor votes on the plan today Friday July However the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week so no informational hearing was held nor will any votes be held today Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week Senator Burtons office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure Accordingly barring the governor calling the legislature back into session we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August and perhaps not then either Other events this week include In Thursdays Los Angeles Times S David Freeman Governor Davis primary negotiator on the longterm contract deals authored an editorial arguing that the states longterm energy contracts were a primary factor in the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market You can find the article at wwwlatimescom It ran on the editorial page on Thursday July It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues The amendments are not yet public but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week We will keep you apprised FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges With California still insisting that it is owed billion by generators the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the states expectations Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision In a press statement earlier this week the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all billion adding As for the energy profiteers and pirates let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California If the FERC does not make California whole we will see you in court US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand Californias power grid along Path by attracting private investment to cover the million project He hopes by increasing the transmission capacity by MWs this plan would alleviate the transmission bottleneck that has proved simply insufficient for power to flow freely throughout the state during times of peak usage According to Senator Dunn Morgan Stanley destroyed key documents years ago relating to the purchase of California power plants despite the financial companys repeated promises to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation that they would turn them over as reported on Monday Meanwhile the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over key documents to the committee Reliant Energy sued California on Monday claiming just compensation for the states failure to adequately pay for longterm power contracts that the governor seized from the Power Exchange in February The state claims those contracts equal about million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than million A judge is expected to oversee this dispute Best regards Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez IEPA Legislative ReportDOC IEPA Legislative Report DOC

Lynn Lednicky Mark Smith Marty Wilson McNally Ray Norton Kelli Roger Pelote Ron Tom Russo Tony StephanieNewell Sue Mara W Hyde Richard Bob Weisenmiller cc Subject FW Davis Press Release on FERB Report GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations Thank you for coming out here today Julee MalinowskiBall Legislative AnalystAssociate CalETCEdsonModisette

behaved this pa st summer A The Requirement to Sell Into and Buy from the PX B The Underscheduling of Loads and Resources C Governance of the PX and ISO D Price Mitigation and the Soft Cap Price Caps Are Generally Ineffective In Achieving Lower Average Energy Prices Price Caps Deter Needed Investment in New California Generation The Soft Cap Puts Power Marketers at Risk How Can the MWh Soft Cap be Made More Palatable a The Sunset Date Must Be Observed b The Soft Cap Should Begin at a Price Higher Than MWh c The Soft Cap Should Be Escalated E Refund Liability F What Were The Real Causes of The Recent Price Increases The Staff Report Identifies the Well Known Factors However There Were Other Factors That Also Contributed Significantly t o the Higher Prices Experienced in California On refunds WPTF is completely consistent with our filing It argues facts do not support a claim for refunds with respect to Summer rates When a market clears at or below the soft cap there should be no refund liability for any seller unless that seller is shown to have manipulated th e market abused market power or colluded When suppliers bid and are paid at rates above the soft cap the definitions of marginal and opportunity costs must be clarified to recogniz e how units are dispatched throughout a year that a contribution to a generators actual fixed costs must be incorporated into the equation fo r marginal costs that forward contracts contribute to the marginal costs of a sale and that opportunity costs include broad market forces such as pric es in competing markets the ability to sell above marginal cost is not evidence of market power or market abuse ensure that transactions above the soft cap are deemed closed and no long er subject to refund within a reasonable time such as one to two months the November Order extends beyond the month potential refund period permitted by the Federal Power Act and should be shortened to conform with the requirements of the Act The filing also has sections opposing loaddifferentiated price caps and a return to costbased rates WPTF asks FERC to clarify the election process on the new Boards to ensure that governmental entities exert no more political pressure BUT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE PART OF THE FILING READ ON D Cost Based Rates A Return to Regulatory Luddism The original Luddites were bands of skilled textile workers who had been laidoff after advances in technology replaced the need for them In reaction to being laidoff they burned mills terrorized the owners and th en destroyed the steam and waterpowered laborsaving devices that had cost th em their jobs The uprisings took place mainly in the center of the wool regi on in England from In other words Luddites were casualties of the English Industrial Revolution Ned Ludd was the movements mythical founder an apprentice who smashe d his shearing frame with a hammer These wooden frames were a new technology which allowed heavy shears to be held in balance to trim a rough layer of threads from woven cloth Although Ned didnt break the machine to make a political statement he inadvertently became the first practitioner of Luddism Thirty years later in pursuit of a naive backtobasics theme Luddites organized and rioted against technological advances in the English textile industry The Luddites rioted in rejection of technology that was seen as threatening to their way of life and livelihood Now in California we have regulatory Luddites The few parties who fall i n this old world camp once controlled the energy investments in California an d now fear the advent of competition bemoan its reduction or elimination o f their previous regulatory overview and seek to smash restructuring as poor Ned smashed his machinery Their arguments are reactionary their politica l tactics oppressive By the English government put down the Luddites with hangings and transportation out of the region In the absence of such remedies today WPTF simply

End To Calif Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the

the generation business Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development acquisition construction management and operation of global power production facilities As one of the worlds leading global power producers Edison Mission Energy owns nearly megawatts of generating capacity including interests in projects currently under construction or operating in Australia Indonesia Italy New Zealand Puerto Rico Spain Thailand Turkey the United Kingdom and the United States Based in Rosemead Calif Edison International is a

From JBennett mailto MSSRcom Sent Tuesday August AM To Mara Susan Subject RE Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message Sue I believe a legitimate contract clause argument can be made However the chances for ultimate success are probably not real high Once we have made the showing that there has been a substantial interference with contracts based on the elements listed in Dans email which I think we can then the burden shifts to the government to show there was a legitimate public purpose in passing the law The law we are dealing with is AB X and in particular the suspension of direct access provision The passage of the law and the suspension of direct access can probably meet the legitimate public purpose test The question then comes down to whether the Commissions implementation of that law so as to suspend direct access retroactively is necessary to meet that legitimate public purpose Given the nature of the legislation and its purview in the regulatory arena the court is likely to defer to the PUC Original Message From Mara Susan mailtoSusanJ NRONcom Sent Tuesday August AM To Subject FW Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message Here is Dans email Original Message From Norman Plotkin mailto Sent Tuesday August A M To Subject FW Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message Original Message From Dan Douglass mailto Sent Wednesday August PM To Weller Andrea Norman Plotkin Subject Re Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDGE is suggesting From a strictly legal perspective it is unlikely that the Commission would vote to suspend direct access retroactively Although an argument could be put forward that the Commission has the authority to do so such an act could be challenged on US Constitutional grounds as being violative of the Contracts Clause Moreover from a practical perspective retroactive suspension would be politically unpalatable and cause a good deal of protest from affected parties However the Commission might choose to so regardless of these factors due to political pressure from Sacramento to ensure the saleability of the power revenue bonds The Commission has frequently reserved to itself the power to modifye xisting contracts particularly those entered into by utilities subject to its jurisdiction It has exercised this right often using as justification wording contained in utility contracts that make the agreements subject to the Commissions continuing jurisdiction including such modifications as it may direct For example the standard ESP Service Agreement used by all three of the states electric utilities provides that This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction and the

mailto Sent Tuesday August AM To Subject FW Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message Original Message From Dan Douglass mailto Sent Wednesday August PM To Weller Andrea Norman Plotkin Subject Re Retroactive Suspension SDGEs message It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDGE is suggesting From a strictly legal perspective it is unlikely that the Commission would vote to suspend direct access retroactively Although an argument could be put forward that the Commission has the authority to do so such an act could be challenged on US Constitutional grounds as being violative of the Contracts Clause Moreover from a practical perspective retroactive suspension would be politically unpalatable and cause a good deal of protest from affected parties However the Commission might choose to so regardless of these factors due to political pressure from Sacramento to ensure the saleability of the power revenue bonds The Commission has frequently reserved to itself the power to modify existing contracts particularly those entered into by utilities subject to its jurisdiction It has exercised this right often using as justification wording contained in utility contracts that make the agreements subject to the Commissions continuing jurisdiction including such modifications as it may direct For example the standard ESP Service Agreement used by all three of the states electric utilities provides that This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction and the Parties may amend the Agreement to conform to changes directed or necessitated by the CPUC This phraseology is typically referred to by the states utilities as a regulatory out clause However this sort of wording has not been required to be included in the contracts entered into by ESPs as the Commission does not regulate these entities ESPs that plan to offer electric services to residential and small commercial customers must fulfill certain registration requirements as adopted by the Commission in Decisions D and D in accordance with Public Utilities Code Section b However ESPs who serve larger customers are not even subject to this registration requirement Most importantly ESP terms and conditions of service are not subject to regulation by the Commission Therefore the

Middle East and Asia Calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK Sept Reuters California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a billion budget deficit in the fiscal year if billion of power bonds are not sold before July The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission PUC into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion The state depleted its general fund by at least billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases There can be no schedule for the bond sale until the PUC completes its work Angelides said Earlier this week the PUC said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for Oct Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown one of five is on board to make the vote but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the PUC Angelides is projecting a billion budget deficit for the fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall US economy slows In a worst case scenario Angelides added that with the bond sale the billion gap may grow to billion while a late sale would push the billion number to billion The treasurer painted a dire picture of California s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early s Angelides warned a percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place or possibly a per student cut in state K education spending Or the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save billion Eighteen percent of the states noneducation budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold he said State cautioned on reliance on natural gas SACRAMENTO California could face another energy crisis by relying too heavily on new natural gasfired plants to boost electricity production said the author of a study released yesterday After a year of volatile natural gas prices the state shouldnt depend too much on gas and should instead invest more in renewable energy according to Predictably Unpredictable a study by the California Public Interest Research Group By putting all of our eggs in one basket California is setting itself up for another energy crisis said Susanna Churchill of CalPIRG Even before the start of Californias energy crisis the state depended on natural gas for more than onethird of its energy needs the report said Eightyfive percent of that gas came from out of state Because the state is so dependent on this one fuel source the price spikes had a tremendous impact on our energy markets the report says Increasing that dependence will only cause future price spikes said Brad Heavner a CalPIRG policy analyst and author of the report About percent of the plants that have been built or are under construction are fired by natural gas Natural gas is being treated as a magic bullet in this state and around the country Heavner said Natural gas is cleaner than coal and less expensive than nuclear and the states new fleet of peaker plants small gasfired power plants that come online when demand is highest can be built quickly But Heavner said Californias demand for natural gas is rising faster than the federal Department of Energy forecast that calls for a percent annual increase in the next years This just means California is particularly vulnerable to any supply disruptions nationwide Heavner said As demand is rising natural gas production is waning he said There are times the number of natural gas wells nationwide as there were in but each well produces a third as much gas Heavner said To stabilize the states energy supply CalPIRG recommends that officials encourage a broader mix of fuels by requiring utilities to buy percent of their power from renewable resources The new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority has set a goal of increasing the states renewable energy output to percent by said Amber Pasricha spokeswoman for the authority The authority has signed letters of intent for new renewable power plant projects including wind and two biofuel projects she said CalPIRG also recommends that state energy regulators deny any pending applications for natural gasfired plants and offer government subsidies to renewable power providers and customers The report also recommends the state review all contracts that the Department of Water Resources has signed with natural gasfired power producers and explore canceling contracts that involve the construction of new gasfired plants Alternative to states SDGE plan in works Approval of the state plan to eliminate the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers could be headed for delay or derailment Consumer advocates and others say they will gather Monday in Sacramento to develop an alternative to the deal which was announced by Gov Gray Davis and the utility in June Consumer groups have criticized the governors plan to eliminate the socalled balancing accounts as costly to consumers and a windfall to the utility The alternative proposal which one consumer advocate says would save ratepayers more money will be submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission for review The commission had been set to complete its review of the governors plan by the end of October Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood who crafted the timetable for the review acknowledged yesterday that his schedule did not anticipate the need to consider an alternative proposal Wood said it was unclear how long that might take Much will depend on the perceived quality of the alternative plan Wood said SDGE meanwhile said it had not decided whether it will participate in the Monday meeting called a settlement conference under PUC rules and criticized the scheduling of the event We believe this is a delaying tactic designed to hijack this process said Ed Van Herik a spokesman for SDGE a unit of San Diegobased Sempra Energy This is designed to undermine the authority of the utilities commission and the governor Van Herik noted that components of the utilitys plan have already been approved while others remain on track But a key issue whether customers or shareholders are entitled to hundreds of millions in profits SDGE earned from selling power to the state has yet to be voted upon by the commission Steve Linsay a supervisor for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates a state office charged with representing consumers noted that PUC regulations require a settlement conference in cases such as this By reaching a settlement with broad sponsorship we hope the commission will give it the serious consideration it warrants Linsay said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network said an alternative proposal could eliminate the million debt lower customer rates and reduce windfalls for SDGE at the same time Consumer groups have been particularly critical of revelations that SDGE earned hundreds of millions in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis Theyve also been critical of the profits they say Sempra will earn from future power sales The governor and SDGE say their plan contains significant concessions by the utility and eliminates the balancing accounts without raising rates Under their proposal the company agrees to return about million in profits from the sale of electricity and pay million to close an investigation into its electricity procurement practices The utility says the balancing account arose when it paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers The million account amounted to a debt of from each residential customer and higher sums from businesses But in computing the debt SDGE has declined to fully credit the profits it earned from power sales to the state The utility says those gains are the exclusive property of its shareholders Power Prices

proposed bankruptcy reorganization should not cause a further erosion of property tax revenues in San Luis Obispo County top company officials said Tuesday The tax base shouldnt change said Gordon Smith president and chief executive officer of PGE If anything it should go up That would be good news to both San Luis Obispo County and the San Luis Coastal Unified School District which have taken budgetary hits in recent years as the companys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant was devalued The power plant was devalued as part of the states electrical deregulation It has cost the county schools and other agencies million a year said Gere Sibbach county auditorcontroller Property tax revenues from Diablo Canyon are divided with a third going to the county a third to schools and a third to other governmental agencies The county has been able to replace the lost utility taxes with other property taxes and has not been as hard hit as the school district which has seen its annual budget go down million or percent PGE officials dont expect property taxes to decrease because the reorganization plan calls for Diablo Canyon and the companys hydroelectric plants to be valued at market rates which are likely to be higher than its present valuation The process is very similar to refinancing a home and should allow the utility to retire its billion debt without selling off any assets Smith said Basically we have taken a second mortgage on our house to keep our house he said Under the companys proposed bankruptcy plan the company now known as PGE will split up The gas and electric distribution part of the company will retain the PGE name while the corporation and the companys electrical generation arm which includes Diablo Canyon will be given a new name The plan must be approved by a bankruptcy judge and various regulators before it becomes final If all goes as planned the reorganization could take effect at the end of AuditorController Sibbach was more cautious in his assessment of the effects of the reorganization on county finances County officials will be carefully tracking the reorganization plan as it wends its way through the approval process I hope he Smith is correct Sibbach said It could be significant

mailto Sent Wednesday September AM To Allen Stevan AReM Douglas Oglesby Email Email Fairchild Tracy Frank Joseph Alamo Email Email Manuel Erica Megan Beiser Norm Plotkin Warner Jami Subject San Diego UnionTribune Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear This article specifically mentions the threatened lawsuit by AREM as having caused the PUC to drop its proposed order to ban direct access retroactively Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER September SACRAMENTO Some utility customers mainly businesses are rushing to sign contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a longdelayed ban raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining customers The state plans to ban direct access contracts with generators to keep customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state since January Those state purchases will be covered in part by a billion bond paid off by ratepayers over years But many businesses which say they need cheaper power now to remain competitive are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the Public Utilities Commission bans directaccess pacts an action that could come as soon as tomorrow We have seen a significant increase in the last month said Ed Van Herik a spokesman for San Diego Gas Electric Co He said the amount of the annual SDGE power load shifted to directaccess contracts with generators increased from percent at the end of July to percent at the end of last month Allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of the states failed attempt to deregulate electricity But when the utilities ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow the state began buying power for utility customers in January To avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase the state decided to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining decadelong power contracts and issuing the billion ratepayer bond Now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons paying their fair share of the statesubsidized power received earlier this year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the longterm contracts and the bond The power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain earlier this year when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the state raised rates for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison by about onethird The state has not raised rates for SDGE customers But an increase averaging percent for SDGE residential customers is on the PUC agenda tomorrow along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way for issuing the billion ratepayer bond PUC President Loretta Lynch said that before wholesale power prices began soaring last year about percent of the power provided by the three investorowned utilities was being bought through directaccess contracts By last March she said the amount dropped to percent Certainly the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year Lynch said But as wholesale power prices dropped in June directaccess contracts began to look like a better deal and a number of customers have left the utilities to get cheaper power At Southern California Edison the number of customers with directaccess contracts grew from on June to by the end of last month an increase of said Steve Hansen an Edison spokesman Now that the market has turned everyone is bailing as fast as they can said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer group Most of the electricity obtained through directaccess contracts in recent months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of electricity Most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing business in the state said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who with Lynch outlined the PUCs proposed actions at a Capitol news conference late last month The PUC delayed action to ban directaccess contracts waiting for the Legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass the utilities if they paid an exit fee to cover their share of statesubsidized power The ban on directaccess contracts originally proposed by the PUC would have been retroactive to July But the retroactive provision was reportedly dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets a group of power marketers In the Legislature a provision allowing utility customers to obtain directaccess contracts beginning in if they pay exit fees was added to the Assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep Edison from joining PGE in bankruptcy The addition of the directaccess provision is one reason that the Assembly version of the Edison plan is supported by the California Chamber of Commerce But the Assembly plan pushed by Gov Gray Davis faces opposition in the Senate Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco said the Senate would send an Edison bill back to the Assembly after making it a lessegregious giveaway to the utility The main provision in the Assembly plan would allow Edison to eliminate most of its debt by issuing billion in bonds that would be paid off by ratepayers The Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights a consumer group in Santa Monica calls the Edison plan a bailout and is threatening to place a measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it be approved by the Legislature and governor And TURN the San Francisco consumer group says the Assembly version of the Edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan approved by the Senate in July and giving Edison an additional billion The consumer group also says the directaccess provision in the Assemblys Edison plan has major loopholes that would allow large customers to leave the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs TURN opposes the reintroduction of direct access because any savings that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the result of cost shifting to those who do not or cannot abandon utility service the consumer group said in a statement Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co Erica Manuel Edelman

Subject San Diego UnionTribune Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear This article specifically mentions the threatened lawsuit by AREM as having caused the PUC to drop its proposed order to ban direct access retroactively Rush to beat directaccess purchase ban spurs fear By Ed Mendel STAFF WRITER September SACRAMENTO Some utility customers mainly businesses are rushing to sign contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a longdelayed ban raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining customers The state plans to ban direct access contracts with generators to keep customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state since January Those state purchases will be covered in part by a billion bond paid off by ratepayers over years But many businesses which say they need cheaper power now to remain competitive are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the Public Utilities Commission bans directaccess pacts an action that could come as soon as tomorrow We have seen a significant increase in the last month said Ed Van Herik a spokesman for San Diego Gas Electric Co He said the amount of the annual SDGE power load shifted to directaccess contracts with generators increased from percent at the end of July to percent at the end of last month Allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of the states failed attempt to deregulate electricity But when the utilities ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow the state began buying power for utility customers in January To avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase the state decided to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining decadelong power contracts and issuing the billion ratepayer bond Now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons paying their fair share of the statesubsidized power received earlier this year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the longterm contracts and the bond The power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain earlier this year when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the state raised rates for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison by about onethird The state has not raised rates for SDGE customers But an increase averaging percent for SDGE residential customers is on the PUC agenda tomorrow along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way for issuing the billion ratepayer bond PUC President Loretta Lynch said that before wholesale power prices began soaring last year about percent of the power provided by the three investorowned utilities was being bought through directaccess contracts By last March she said the amount dropped to percent Certainly the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year Lynch said But as wholesale power prices dropped in June directaccess contracts began to look like a better deal and a number of customers have left the utilities to get cheaper power At Southern California Edison the number of customers with directaccess contracts grew from on June to by the end of last month an increase of said Steve Hansen an Edison spokesman Now that the market has turned everyone is bailing as fast as they can said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network a San Franciscobased consumer group Most of the electricity obtained through directaccess contracts in recent months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of electricity Most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing business in the state said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood who with Lynch outlined the PUCs proposed actions at a Capitol news conference late last month The PUC delayed action to ban directaccess contracts waiting for the Legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass the utilities if they paid an exit fee to cover their share of statesubsidized power The ban on directaccess contracts originally proposed by the PUC would have been retroactive to July But the retroactive provision was reportedly dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets a group of power marketers In the Legislature a provision allowing utility customers to obtain directaccess contracts beginning in if they pay exit fees was added to the Assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep Edison from joining PGE in bankruptcy The addition of the directaccess provision is one reason that the Assembly version of the Edison plan is supported by the California Chamber of Commerce But the Assembly plan pushed by Gov Gray Davis faces opposition in the Senate Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco said the Senate would send an Edison bill back to the Assembly after making it a lessegregious giveaway to the utility The main provision in the Assembly plan would allow Edison to eliminate most of its debt by issuing billion in bonds that would be paid off by ratepayers The Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights a consumer group in Santa Monica calls the Edison plan a bailout and is threatening to place a measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it be approved by the Legislature and governor And TURN the San Francisco consumer group says the Assembly version of the Edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan approved by the Senate in July and giving Edison an additional billion The consumer group also says the directaccess provision in the Assemblys Edison plan has major loopholes that would allow large customers to leave the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs TURN opposes the reintroduction of direct access because any savings that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the result of cost shifting to those who do not or cannot abandon utility service the consumer group said in a statement Copyright UnionTribune Publishing Co Erica Manuel Edelman

Petition and Points and Authorities I am attaching the Joint Petition which assumes that a direct access customer joins Enron The draft is considerably improved over the draft sent yesterday but it does not take in the comments below These will be reviewed and integrated into the next draft I am very concerned about the exhaustion of remedies problem The jurisdictional statute is PUC section a This provision suggests that an aggrieved party must seek a rehearing before the PUC before seeking review by the Supreme Court A request for rehearing must be made within days after the PUC acts but there is no time within which the PUC must act If the PUC agreed to stay the Order then it seems clear that a rehearing must be sought before applying to the Supreme Court If the PUC refuses the stay request then there is a good argument that one of the exceptions to the exhaustion of remedies would apply This will require that one or all of the Petitioners request a stay by the PUC Douglass indicates that a stay would be unusual and that such requests normally are not made In this case it is probably necessary to circumvent the exhaustion issue EWD JBennett MSSRcom AM Sue I have reviewed the Petition and associated Memorandum A couple of general comments We make the point throughout page is the first time that the Commissions action retroactive suspension will result in a windfall to the UDCs as they will be paid for services provided by Enron and other ESPs It is not clear to me that we can make this argument The commissions order does not indicate that the ESPs have to pay the UDCs the amounts that they have received from their direct access customers for the past two months for energy procurement The commission could just as easily decide that although customers who entered into DA contracts after July are no longer allowed to continue on DA they will not go back and undo transactions that have already occurred In the section of the memorandum discussing why the petition is properly before the court Section IV we are discussing why an application for rehearing is unnecessary We state that in this case a rehearing would be superfluous and unnecessary as there are no new legal arguments and no additional evidence to be presented Such argument appears to run counter to our contentions that because of the lack of hearing in this proceeding the Commissions decision lacks the support it needs or on the flip side denied us the opportunity to put on evidence to show the suspension of direct access was unnecessary In section VI e of the Memorandum arguing that the impairment of contracts ordered by the Commission is not reasonable or appropriate we state that the Commissions motive is not the announced purpose that its purpose instead is malevolent as illustrated by the rhetoric directed at out of state energy companies I dont think such an argument adds anything and although it maybe true at this stage it probably is not a good idea to assert that the Commission is purposely hurting the state to get back at the out of state energy companies Jeanne Original Message From Mara Susan mailtoSusanJ NRONcom Sent Monday September AM To Kaufman Paul

at the prehearing conference today The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time most likely the ruling will be out within a week PX Audit The Commission will decide the issue on the current record this is fine with us Implementation of Suspension of DA This includes all the DASR issues ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings The following schedule was agreed to Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities Parties file comments on utilities proposal may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary Parties file responses on the comments All other issues will be addressed at another Prehearing conference on In response to a question the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue He also said several times however that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents To most logical people this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue but hey this is California Bottomline This turned out better than we had expected We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday November PM To Blachman Jeremy Mara Susan Steffes James D Shapiro Richard Kean Steven J Kaufman Paul Leff Dan Hughes Evan Sharp Vicki Williams Robert C Dietrich Janet Huddleson Diann Smith Mike Frazier Lamar Tribolet Michael Mellencamp Lisa Curry Wanda Swain Steve Subject Update on California PUC HearingDA Suspension Implementation Exit Fees PX Credit etc Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension With minor exceptions the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didnt need to conduct hearings and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees The utilities said that hearings could be held sometime later to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference The next hearing will be on Dec th The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday In sum there will be another hearing on Dec th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues At this point it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings Of particular note at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July and that he didnt think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either Worried that he said too much he then said he couldntshouldnt spead for the commissioner The judge and the Commissioner who was at the hearing went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that the Commission didnt need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and the Commission doesnt have the authority to ask to see contracts and they aint likely going to get them without a fight Though the probability many not be high there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity Interestingly Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January its proposal to charge all customersDA and bundled alikefor Edisons undercollection The judge literally laughed off the request and then said no As a result Edison didnt get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing eg why are you here you refuse to be a party you refuse to provide info etc From todays hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized In related news Davis has announced that hes asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that hed thus far met with two other generators in serious negotitations

read the PGE reps answer again I think Tom Heckman misinterpreted what Rod Lee said I agree with Rod Lee He did not say that Enron could not submit DASRs he said we had to have the account on the list and if we did then the DASR would be processed If we did not have the account on the list there would have to be some verification that the contract was signed on or before Enron and the other ESPs previously agreed with this approach although the utilities did not fully buy into it I believe Diann submitted the account information as we had agreed on Nov I take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject DASRs for accounts not on the Nov list until the contract is verified but I believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with ESPs and utilities on Oct I think Mr Heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities but thats not how I read the reply from Mr Lee So I called Peter Ouberg back and said told him there didnt appear to be a problem after all but that I would let him know if one cropped up IF you would like me to speak to Mr Heckman I would be happy to do so Sue Mara Original Message From Riley Tom

anytime afterwards The Commission has ordered the UDCs to accept DASRs indefinitely for customer accounts that meet the Sept th customer contract deadline The November deadline still exists presumably Enron has submitted Sutters valid account numbers on that list If DASRs are submitted on accounts that are not on the list they will be rejected until such time that verification of a legitimate

DASRs Rod On the question of whether new accounts can be added to old contracts The October PGE implementation plan for direct access winddown you recently shared with me gave deadlines of October and November respectively for ESPs to provide names of customers and details of customer accounts to be added to direct access I quote additional wording referring to the above timelines require ESPs to specify those customers by name whose contracts qualify them for the submission of additional DASRs Thus PGEs plan clearly contemplates the addition of new accounts to old contracts Now October CPUC ruling D states For purposes of utility compliance with D we want to make it clear that unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September Therefore it being PGEs intent to let new accounts be DASRd to old agreements which include a provision for adding new accounts and it being the CPUCs explicit ruling that no time limit be set on this activity Sutter Health is moving forward with plans to add a number of accounts to its current direct access arrangement with Enron Please let me know if you anticipate any barriers to this action at your end as arrangements with Enron will take a lot of time and energy Cordially Tom

out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Unfortunately however the Senate has not gotten the job done It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers We worked hard to bring this energy which was crucial in avoiding blackouts back online earlier this summer I will call a Third

another shot at saving Edison from sli ding into bankruptcy I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the bu siness of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness Davi s in a statement after midnight Saturday Unfortunately however the Sena te has not gotten the job done The new schoolimprovement program would provide grants of per student to schools with the states lowest test scores They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic worki ng conditions that other workers have in state law Those include a minu te rest break for every four hours of work tools paid for by the employer and toilets lights and water in

Reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company t o pay all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter bankruptcy proceedings The official creditors committee supports the plan This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Electric Company to move out of Chapter as a financially strong business positioned to continue safe reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electricity to its customers pay all valid creditor claims in full and do so without asking for a rate increase or a state bailout said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman CEO and President of PGE Corporation And the plan will enable us to provide longterm growth prospects to shareholders The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation into two separate standalone companies no longer affiliated with one another The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution system The electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmission operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be part of PGE Corporation The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric will be distributed to PGE Corporation shareholders The electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations when reorganized as new businesses under PGE Corporation will have the ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacific Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors claims The plan also restructures certain existing debt and uses billion in cash on hand to satisfy creditor claims Under the plan all valid creditor claims will be paid in full using a combination of cash and longterm notes In total the plan will provide creditors with about billion in cash and billion in notes The vast majority of creditorsthose with allowed claims of or lesswill receive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effective date of the plan Most secured creditors will also receive percent of their allowed claims in cash Finally unsecured creditors with allowed claims in excess of the threshold will be paid percent in cash and percent in notes Following the restructuring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation will be organized as follows Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporation focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to its customers in Northern and Central California It will hold percent of the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ people Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the full range of utility services to one out of every Americans PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group business will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerly under Pacific Gas and Electric Company The new electric generation business will be a California company established to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and associated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation districts now held by the utility In total the unit will have approximately megawatts of generation The facilities will be operate d in accordance with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in keeping with sound environmental stewardship policies The generating business will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company under a year contract at a stable marketbased rate The new electric transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the transmission system currently operated b y the utility The system comprises circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including miles of transmission pipelines and three gas storage facilities Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission will continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company including retail electric and natural gas rates The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of service provided by the electric transmission business FERC will also assume jurisdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service fo r the gas transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reliable and longterm electric supply to California customers It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce And it enables us to keep ou r generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essentially the same people who operate the various assets under the curren t organization We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said Glynn We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by th e people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for customers and employees the plan also provides longterm benefits to the state It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Electric Company would be financially able to reassume the procurement responsibility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water Resources The Chapter process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to resolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness It has our full support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution o f the Chapter process With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Chapter process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditworthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customers confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders PGE News Calvin

officials Inline attachment follows From To Aryeh Fishman Andrea Settanni Dan Watkiss Jacqueline Java Kimberly Curry Ronald Carroll Date Thursday September GMT Subject FYI the list of people who received the subpoenas is at the end of this article State subpoenas energy officials Senate investigating decisions that led to lifting limits on electricity prices Mark Martin Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday September San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL A state Senate committee began delivering subpoenas yesterday to California energy officials to determine whether they colluded to manipulate the states dysfunctional power market The probe will focus on decisions made last December that led federal regulators to lift limits on the price of electricity and sent costs skyrocketing said state Sen Joseph Dunn DSanta Ana Dunn wants to know why Terry Winter the man in charge of the states power grid defied his board of directors and Gov Gray Davis when he asked federal regulators to remove key price caps A spokesman for Winter said that the limits were causing energy producers to abandon California and that Winter acted to keep the state from plunging into darkness But with the price ceilings eliminated energy prices soared and Californias three electricity utilities began tumbling toward insolvency forcing the state to begin buying power with taxpayer dollars according to Dunn The way things unfolded in December are very suspicious and they directly led to the disaster that struck in January said Dunn chairman of a special Senate committee investigating energy market manipulation Winter who is president and chief executive officer of the Independent System Operator and others will be required to provide sworn testimony in depositions They also must provide email messages notes and phone records The others facing subpoenas include highlevel ISO management officials and current and former board members The ISO board which had members who worked for energy producers was accused by many of being too cozy with power providers and was replaced in January by a fivemember panel appointed by Davis Dunn hopes to retrace events surrounding some of the peak days of the states energy crisis The ISO board had throughout the year lowered the limits at which energy producers could sell power Price controls that were set at per megawatt were reduced dramatically by October But soaring natural gas prices greatly increased the costs of producing electricity and by the end of the month generators sent a flurry of letters to the Federal Energy Commission urging an end to price limits By December electricity producers were not interested in selling power to California utilities at rates that meant they would lose money said Gregg Fishman an ISO spokesman The market was completely dysfunctional at that point Fishman said There was no energy being bid Were supposed to keep the lights on so something had to be done On Friday Dec without telling ISO board members or the governor Winter and other top ISO managers sent a page request to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission officials asking that they make an emergency ruling and drop price caps The commission which had outlined a plan in November to end the price limits approved the request Generators were allowed to charge more than per megawatt as long as they could prove their costs Average prices the utilities paid for electricity shot up from per megawatt on Dec to per megawatt on Dec Less than a month later the state began buying power for cashstrapped utilities which couldnt afford the high prices They ISO officials poured gasoline on a fire said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman Although Winter who serves at the pleasure of the board was acting within ISO rules during an emergency the governor and some power grid board members were outraged at the behindthescenes maneuvering Dunn wants to know whether the ISO and energy producers campaigned together to eliminate the price limits I was appalled we werent consulted about something so significant said Michael Florio a consumer advocate who sits on the ISO board It was bad judgment at the very least Florio one of those subpoenaed by Dunns committee said the ISO board met the next week to discuss Winters actions but he said a majority of board members didnt want to get rid of the president of the power grid in the middle of a crisis Subpoenaed The people subpoenaed in the state Senate investigation of energy market manipulation are STAFF MEMBERS Terry Winter ISO president and chief executive

Middle East and Asia Calif power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK Sept Reuters California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a billion budget deficit in the fiscal year if billion of power bonds are not sold before July The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission PUC into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion The state depleted its general fund by at least billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the states general fund and make future power purchases There can be no schedule for the bond sale until the PUC completes its work Angelides said Earlier this week the PUC said the muchdelayed meeting is now set for Oct Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown one of five is on board to make the vote but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners are not ready to act Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds still need to be decided by the PUC Angelides is projecting a billion budget deficit for the fiscal year even if the bonds are sold in time due to reduced revenues as the overall US economy slows In a worst case scenario Angelides added that with the bond sale the billion gap may grow to billion while a late sale would push the billion number to billion The treasurer painted a dire picture of California s budget if the bonds are not sold likening it to the states budget problems of the early s Angelides warned a percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place or possibly a per student cut in state K education spending Or the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save billion Eighteen percent of the states noneducation budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold he said State cautioned on reliance on natural gas SACRAMENTO California could face another energy crisis by relying too heavily on new natural gasfired plants to boost electricity production said the author of a study released yesterday After a year of volatile natural gas prices the state shouldnt depend too much on gas and should instead invest more in renewable energy according to Predictably Unpredictable a study by the California Public Interest Research Group By putting all of our eggs in one basket California is setting itself up for another energy crisis said Susanna Churchill of CalPIRG Even before the start of Californias energy crisis the state depended on natural gas for more than onethird of its energy needs the report said Eightyfive percent of that gas came from out of state Because the state is so dependent on this one fuel source the price spikes had a tremendous impact on our energy markets the report says Increasing that dependence will only cause future price spikes said Brad Heavner a CalPIRG policy analyst and author of the report About percent of the plants that have been built or are under construction are fired by natural gas Natural gas is being treated as a magic bullet in this state and around the country Heavner said Natural gas is cleaner than coal and less expensive than nuclear and the states new fleet of peaker plants small gasfired power plants that come online when demand is highest can be built quickly But Heavner said Californias demand for natural gas is rising faster than the federal Department of Energy forecast that calls for a percent annual increase in the next years This just means California is particularly vulnerable to any supply disruptions nationwide Heavner said As demand is rising natural gas production is waning he said There are times the number of natural gas wells nationwide as there were in but each well produces a third as much gas Heavner said To stabilize the states energy supply CalPIRG recommends that officials encourage a broader mix of fuels by requiring utilities to buy percent of their power from renewable resources The new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority has set a goal of increasing the states renewable energy output to percent by said Amber Pasricha spokeswoman for the authority The authority has signed letters of intent for new renewable power plant projects including wind and two biofuel projects she said CalPIRG also recommends that state energy regulators deny any pending applications for natural gasfired plants and offer government subsidies to renewable power providers and customers The report also recommends the state review all contracts that the Department of Water Resources has signed with natural gasfired power producers and explore canceling contracts that involve the construction of new gasfired plants Alternative to states SDGE plan in works Approval of the state plan to eliminate the million debt SDGE says it is owed by its customers could be headed for delay or derailment Consumer advocates and others say they will gather Monday in Sacramento to develop an alternative to the deal which was announced by Gov Gray Davis and the utility in June Consumer groups have criticized the governors plan to eliminate the socalled balancing accounts as costly to consumers and a windfall to the utility The alternative proposal which one consumer advocate says would save ratepayers more money will be submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission for review The commission had been set to complete its review of the governors plan by the end of October Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood who crafted the timetable for the review acknowledged yesterday that his schedule did not anticipate the need to consider an alternative proposal Wood said it was unclear how long that might take Much will depend on the perceived quality of the alternative plan Wood said SDGE meanwhile said it had not decided whether it will participate in the Monday meeting called a settlement conference under PUC rules and criticized the scheduling of the event We believe this is a delaying tactic designed to hijack this process said Ed Van Herik a spokesman for SDGE a unit of San Diegobased Sempra Energy This is designed to undermine the authority of the utilities commission and the governor Van Herik noted that components of the utilitys plan have already been approved while others remain on track But a key issue whether customers or shareholders are entitled to hundreds of millions in profits SDGE earned from selling power to the state has yet to be voted upon by the commission Steve Linsay a supervisor for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates a state office charged with representing consumers noted that PUC regulations require a settlement conference in cases such as this By reaching a settlement with broad sponsorship we hope the commission will give it the serious consideration it warrants Linsay said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network said an alternative proposal could eliminate the million debt lower customer rates and reduce windfalls for SDGE at the same time Consumer groups have been particularly critical of revelations that SDGE earned hundreds of millions in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis Theyve also been critical of the profits they say Sempra will earn from future power sales The governor and SDGE say their plan contains significant concessions by the utility and eliminates the balancing accounts without raising rates Under their proposal the company agrees to return about million in profits from the sale of electricity and pay million to close an investigation into its electricity procurement practices The utility says the balancing account arose when it paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers The million account amounted to a debt of from each residential customer and higher sums from businesses But in computing the debt SDGE has declined to fully credit the profits it earned from power sales to the state The utility says those gains are the exclusive property of its shareholders Power Prices

proposed bankruptcy reorganization should not cause a further erosion of property tax revenues in San Luis Obispo County top company officials said Tuesday The tax base shouldnt change said Gordon Smith president and chief executive officer of PGE If anything it should go up That would be good news to both San Luis Obispo County and the San Luis Coastal Unified School District which have taken budgetary hits in recent years as the companys Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant was devalued The power plant was devalued as part of the states electrical deregulation It has cost the county schools and other agencies million a year said Gere Sibbach county auditorcontroller Property tax revenues from Diablo Canyon are divided with a third going to the county a third to schools and a third to other governmental agencies The county has been able to replace the lost utility taxes with other property taxes and has not been as hard hit as the school district which has seen its annual budget go down million or percent PGE officials dont expect property taxes to decrease because the reorganization plan calls for Diablo Canyon and the companys hydroelectric plants to be valued at market rates which are likely to be higher than its present valuation The process is very similar to refinancing a home and should allow the utility to retire its billion debt without selling off any assets Smith said Basically we have taken a second mortgage on our house to keep our house he said Under the companys proposed bankruptcy plan the company now known as PGE will split up The gas and electric

Sent Monday October AM To Cc Allen Stevan Manuel Erica Subject SDUT Small users might face billion power bill AReMers Heres the San Diego Union Story that ran on Saturday It includes only part of my quote What I said in total when asked to response from AReMs perspective on Angelides comments that DA would shift B over time to other ratepayers was Direct access is still a small part of Californias energy market However direct access is being held up as the scapegoat when one of the biggest problems we have right now is billion in contracts that effectively hold California ratepayers hostage to the utilities for decades if not renegotiated Small users might face billion power bill Directaccess loophole used by big customers By Craig D Rose STAFF WRITER October A legal loophole exploited by large electricity customers could leave mostly smaller customers shouldering billion more in electricity costs than they should the state treasurer disclosed yesterday The loophole opened over the summer when it became clear that large customers could get lower electricity prices and might avoid the billions in state costs from the electricity crisis by entering into socalled directaccess relationships with alternative electricity suppliers Under directaccess deals customers bypass their local utility as a source of electricity and turn instead to an outside provider The California Public Utilities Commission barred direct access in late September In a letter yesterday State Treasurer Philip Angelides chided the utilities commission for failing to close the loophole sooner and urged commissioners to retroactively cancel directaccess deals dating to July Angelides said the directaccess stampede which occurred as the PUC failed to act could cost utility customers million through and more than billion while the state is financing power costs Commission President Loretta Lynch said the PUC delayed dealing with direct access on the advice of the governor Angelides and the Legislature She added that the commission is considering retroactive cancellation of directaccess deals Other state officials meanwhile offered few clues yesterday as to how they plan to seek changes to some of the longterm contracts that cover billion in state power purchases Gov Gray Davis indicated Thursday that he might seek to renegotiate some contract terms In a teleconference yesterday advisers to the governor said discussing their strategy might compromise their bargaining position Barry Goode Davis legal secretary said the state is not pursuing changes for all the longterm contracts there are more than and he defended the contracts as very valuable and an asset to the state A growing number of critics says the contracts bind the state to expensive and in some case unnecessary electricity purchases Industrial and large commercial customers meanwhile scrambled over the summer to avoid those state costs by signing directaccess deals From July until Sept when the PUC barred the deals large customers boosted the amount of power they bought via direct access from percent to percent In San Diego Gas Electric territory the flight was heavier About percent of electricity now purchased by large power users is done via direct access bypassing the utility At the same time direct access has been largely unavailable to smaller customers In fact providers dumped residential directaccess customers as uneconomical during the power crisis Smaller customers of SDGE Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co meanwhile must now bear the costs of Californias longterm power contracts and of costs incurred earlier this year to deal with the crisis The impact of direct access was underscored in an additional way by state officials yesterday Advisers to the governor explained that estimates of state power purchase obligations for and have fallen by about percent from billion down to billion But the retail cost of statepurchased electricity will fall only percent for the overwhelming majority of utility customers statewide Thats because fewer customers remain to pay the costs according to the state Department of Water Resources which is responsible for Californias power purchases The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets an electricity supplier group reiterated yesterday that it will sue the utilities commission if it moves to retroactively cancel direct access Tracy Fairchild a spokeswoman for the group said direct access was not the cause of high power prices for the state One of the biggest problems we have right now is billion in contracts that effectively hold California ratepayers hostage to the utilities for decades if not renegotiated Fairchild said In a separate matter the utilities commission said yesterday it will not schedule additional hearings to deal with a second plan for resolving the million debt that SDGE says it is owed by its customers Commission President Loretta Lynch indicated last week that hearings might be held in San Diego Lynch said yesterday she erred in suggesting the hearings without first consulting with Commissioner Carl Wood who is assigned to oversee the SDGE proceedings Consumer and environmental groups filed the second plan as an alternative to a proposal presented by SDGE and the governor for dealing with the debt Consumer groups say their plan would require at least million more from the utility to pay down the debt and would thereby save consumers at least that much money State officials also said yesterday that the governor and state Legislature remain at loggerheads over a bill by Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton DSan Francisco that would separate a billion bond offering from the power contracts The bill was approved by the Legislature in special session Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said again yesterday that the governor will veto the bill which has not yet been sent to him The Davis administration says the bill would trigger lawsuits from electricity suppliers who hold contracts with the state Staff writer Ed Mendel and the Associated Press contributed to this report Craig Roses email address is His

JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesCalifornias grid operator may be in violation of federal regulations by forcing utilities to buy expensive power the state secured under long and shortterm contracts in place of electricity that is available from their own lowcost power plants The California Independent System Operator the agency that operates the realtime electricity market and maintains reliability of the grid in the state has given priority during the past three months to power the state Department of Water Resources locked in under the billion of longterm contracts before utilizing electricity from lowcost power plants according to several executives at the agency Greg Fishman an ISO spokesman said there are times this doesnt happen much when because of varying ramp rates we take a bid out of sequence meaning when one plant has a bid of lets say a megawatthour and another has a bid we may take the bid because it would take longer to deliver the power Fishman said the market is not working as it is designed to Since the demise of the California Power Exchange we the industry have been forced to make the market function given the tools that we have Fishman said The PX was a major portion of the market Without it we are left trying to put the market back into shape given the current players in the market However the ISOs federal tariff states that the agency must use the cheapest electricity available in the wholesale market before dispatching the more expensive electricity to generators and retail customers The ISO shall dispatch generating unitsto meet its imbalance energy requirements based on order of energy bid prices reads a section of the rules approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The ISO shall not discriminate between generating units system units loads and system resources other than based on price and the effectiveness location and ramp rate of the resource concerned to respond to the fluctuation in demand or generation Fishman acknowledged that the market is not working as it is designed to but he said the ISO would not respond to specific questions related to the possibility that the agency has violated its federal tariff or other issues related to the operation of the ISO market We are looking into a variety of issues surrounding that dysfunction and in due course we will answer those issues he said Agency Fails To Reveal Price Data For DWR Power Moreover the ISO has failed to disclose on its web site the price of the DWR power which is also required under federal regulations Jan SmutnyJones executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association a trade group representing large and small power producers said there is absolutely no transparency in the ISO market No one knows what theyre paying for The DWR which started buying power in lieu of Californias ailing utilities in January signed billion in longterm supply contracts over the past six months at prices that now exceed the spot market price for electricity The DWR at times has had a surplus of electricity and has sold some of it into the spot market at a million loss over the last three months As a result the ISO has ordered the Mohave Generating Station a coalfired power plant in Nevada capable of producing electricity at roughly cents a kilowatthour to reduce output at the facility Fishman said The megawatt Mohave unit is majority owned by Edison International EIX news msgs unit Southern California Edison Fishman said last week that the ISO is investigating the circumstances that led the grid operator to order the units to ramp down By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires

weeks legislative report for IEP Despite the summer break leaders in the Assembly planned to call back their side of the Legislature to debate and vote on a rescue plan for Southern California Edison The new effort was outlined in our Tuesday fax to each of you In short the new plan called for amending SB xx and AB xx to among other things provide for a dedicated rate component to support a billion bond financing by Edison but would have prevented Edison from using the funds to pay generators PX and ISO invoices directly or indirectly The billion could be used to pay QFs The dedicated rate component for repayment of the bonds would apply to all consumers for two years and then apply solely to noncore customers Additionally under the plan the haircuttrust account concept was deleted the decision on a transmission line purchase was deferred to settlement discussions between the state and Edison the RPS targeted a growth in new generating capacity through and direct access would be permitted under certain circumstances effective no earlier than January The Assembly leadership planned on holding an informational meeting on the new plan on Thursday July and committee and floor votes on the plan today Friday July However the leadership could not garner enough votes for this new plan this week so no informational hearing was held nor will any votes be held today Even if this new plan had been approved by the Assembly this week Senator Burtons office made it very clear that Senator Burton had no intention of bringing his house back in to session to vote on the measure Accordingly barring the governor calling the legislature back into session we do not expect any other activity on this new plan before the legislature reconvenes on August and perhaps not then either Other events this week include In Thursdays Los Angeles Times S David Freeman Governor Davis primary negotiator on the longterm contract deals authored an editorial arguing that the states longterm energy contracts were a primary factor in the recent reduction in energy prices on the spot market You can find the article at wwwlatimescom It ran on the editorial page on Thursday July It is our understanding that on Thursday Senator Byron Sher had draft amendments prepared by his staff to amend SB to address Renewable Portfolio Standards issues The amendments are not yet public but we are hopeful that we will be able to obtain them when his staff returns next week We will keep you apprised FERC ordered hearings on Wednesday to determine how much money electric generators owe California for wholesale power overcharges With California still insisting that it is owed billion by generators the expected FERC decision on the refund amount is certain to fall short of the states expectations Lawsuits are expected to follow issuance of the decision In a press statement earlier this week the governor stated his hopes that California will receive all billion adding As for the energy profiteers and pirates let me make clear that I will not rest until every dollar gouged from California businesses and residents returns to California If the FERC does not make California whole we will see you in court US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveiled a plan on Monday that would expand Californias power grid along Path by attracting private investment to cover the million project He hopes by increasing the transmission capacity by MWs this plan would alleviate the transmission bottleneck that has proved simply insufficient for power to flow freely throughout the state during times of peak usage According to Senator Dunn Morgan Stanley destroyed key documents years ago relating to the purchase of California power plants despite the financial companys repeated promises to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation that they would turn them over as reported on Monday Meanwhile the committee continued to move forward with their contempt proceedings against Enron and Reliant for refusing to hand over key documents to the committee Reliant Energy sued California on Monday claiming just compensation for the states failure to adequately pay for longterm power contracts that the governor seized from the Power Exchange in February The state claims those contracts equal about million while Reliant calculates that the same contracts are worth more than million A judge is expected to oversee this dispute Best regards Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez IEPA Legislative ReportDOC IEPA Legislative Report DOC

Kelly Email Katie Kaplan Email Jean Munoz Email Andy Brown Email Carol Hudson Email Sandra Moseley Email Subject RE Legislative Report Dear all Attached is this weeks legislative report This entire week has been focused on devising a solution for the energy crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget Although the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the budget on Monday the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucial trailer bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill There are approximately trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget bill but have raised concerns for the Republicans SB Transportation Funding Shift SB Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs SB Omnibus Health Trailer Bill AB Public Social Services and SB Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill Senate President pro Tempore John Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly As of pm tonight there is no budget deal Meanwhile on the energy front the four proposals we have been discussing all week SB xx Burton SB xx Polanco AB xx Keeley and AB xx Wright are still in play legislatively this evening even though the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly and Senate to stay in session despite the scheduled summer break until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature SB xx Polanco Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES The originally introduced version of SB xx reflected the terms of the original Memorandum of Understanding MOU negotiated between Governor Davis and Southern California Edison Edison It was recently amended to reflect Senator Shers proposed Plan B of the MOU a version of the MOU opposed by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy It was heard in the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Wednesday where it failed on a AYES and NOES vote Reconsideration was granted however and the bill passed out of the committee with AYES and NOES on Thursday morning The authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause changing the rate component from KWs to KWs placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section which insulated Edison International from certain claims during the Thursday hearing SB xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday with AYES and NOES SB xx Burton Department of Water Resources electricity bond financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NOES making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower cheaper rate than allotted in AB x Keeley assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill is signed by Governor Davis The bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and requires certain sunshine provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the DWR We understand that JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering have advised the governors office that SB xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed The bill was heard by the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a AYES and NOES vote It next must be heard in the Assembly AB xx Keeley Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening on a AYES and NOES vote It was then heard later the same evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee where it was passed on a AYES and NOES vote This is the compromise bill we have been discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred Keeley The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full Assembly possibly later this evening The current version of the bill provides for limited direct access state purchase of Edisons transmission lines for billion a minimum percent haircut for the major generators and a trust to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option AB xx Wright Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of was amended into AB xx by Assembly Member Bill Campbell in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening and then passed out of committee with AYES and NOES It next must be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee barring a rule waiver No such committee hearing is scheduled at this time Coauthored by Assembly Members Rod Wright Keith Richman Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection among other things Other energyrelated developments this week include SB xx Burton State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with AYES and NO and sent to the Assembly This bill provides million from the state General Fund to the California Energy Commission CEC to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals The grant program will be administered by the CEC in consultation with local governments and will provide percent of the cost of the battery backup system It next must be heard in the Assembly The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday the FERC announced on Friday Despite a Dec FERC order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the ISO the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the states domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities SB xx Burton Electrical restructuring rates passed out of the full Senate on Thursday with AYES and NOES This bill bars the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC from raising rates back to the pre percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on March It next must be heard in the Assembly The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies trading practices The resolution SR passed out with AYES and NOES The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texasbased Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents Despite Reliants having handed over documents the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of Reliants documents The committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents The contempt citation against Reliant will be presented to the full Senate and then immediately sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts Dunn said The states estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from billion to billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment in the states figure on Wednesday Although the state continues to argue that the billion figure is correct FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called the figure baseless and criticized the California delegation for not negotiating in good faith during the recent settlement discussions The new amount billion does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers two entities that do not fall under the purview of the ISO PX or the state DWR as well as applies FERC price controls imposed June and retroactively takes into account sales from October onward AB xx Migden Electrical restructuring Oversight Board ISO passed out of the Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee on Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with AYES and NOES It was amended by the author in committee to doublejoin it to SB xx see below This amendment ties the ultimate fate of AB xx to the fate of AB xx unless the doublejoiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature assuming the bill gets to the governor SB xx Speier Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with AYES and NOES Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the

<16164030.1075849398791.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,susan.mara@enron.com,2001-07-17 09:16:00,Resolution E Approved by CPUC SDGE surcharge exempts DA Cc current and returning DA customers are exempt from the San Diego surcharge Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM Dan Douglass AM To ARM cc Subject Resolution E Approved The Commission approved Resolution E on a vote at the July meeting A copy of the final resolution which has several changes from t he draft issued a few weeks ago is attached for your information The Resolution explicitly states that DA customers are exempt from the AB rate surcharge as AReM advocated in its July comments It also states that any DA customer returning to bundled service will not be exempt from the surcharge However a subsequent return to DA appears to make the customer exempt again The following are some excerpts from the Resolutio n relating to these issues Two parties filed comments on the recirculated resolution SDGE and AR M both on July Some of the implementation issues raised by SDGE require clarifications as discussed in the remainder of this section SDGE next maintains that the draft Resolution resolves two issues that instead should be resolved in A and A changes in the definition of small customers and the treatment of DA customers We note that the Commission has not publicly issued a Proposed Decision or draft Alternate Decision in those proceedings addressing the treatment of DA customers or the definition of small customers With respect to the treatment of DA customers we see no reason why it is improper to address that issue here as that issue has been addressed by t he participants in this informal proceeding Accordingly we determine that D A customers are exempt from recovery of the undercollection that results from the AB energy price ceiling based only on the record established for this Resolution That is we base this determination on relevant information contained in protests and responses to protests on the advice letters addressed by this Resolution and comments and reply comments on drafts of this Resolution that were circulated for public comment SDGE also asserts in its July comments that the draft Resolution finds DA Issues moot but addresses them anyway SDGE also argues that it withdrew AL E and that the draft Resolution inappropriately addressed two issues exempting DA customers from any future cost recovery obligations associated with AB rate ceiling benefits and determining what the obligations are of DA customers who return to utility bundled service SDGE also maintains that the Resolution must be revised to avoi d gaming by customers who attempt to avoid paying their share of the undercollection We first note that the draft Resolution clearly noted at page the continued relevance of DA issues despite SDGEs withdrawal of AL E The passage of Assembly X and the potential for the Commission to suspe nd Direct Access reduce the potential for gaming With no individual tracking missmatches between benefits and repayment obligations are inevitable Limiting rate ceiling cost recovery responsibility to bundled service customers is an expedient way to mitigate such mismatches and is supported in the discussion section of the resolution by the ADJs intent to not discriminate against DA customers SDGE states in its July comments that the draft Resolution must be changed to clearly state that customers cannot avoid paying for costs simp ly by switching back and forth between bundled service and DA and that the only customers who will avoid paying for costs are those who never caused them to be incurred in the first place But the reverse could also be true Some DA customers that were returned to bundled service in early not having received the largest part of the rate ceiling benefit might have the same repayment obligations as bundled SDGE customers that received the benefit back to June as well as those that just move in to SDGE service territory when the benefit ends and the repayment begins We do not address these issues in this Resolution In the Resolution we determined that the complexity of individual tracking at this point is likely to outweigh its benefits ARM in its comments on the recirculated resolution supports the order that DA customers should not be liable for any SDGE undercollection balancing account However ARM proposes a single change to the draft Resolution regarding the treatment of customers who spend some time on a nd sometime off direct access DA and who find themselves for whatever reason off DA when SDGE recovers undercollections arising from AB If the Commission is unwilling to require individual customer tracking an d if these customers are for whatever reason off DA when SDGE assesses undercollection obligations arising from AB the Commission should trea t them as DA customers We will not adopt ARMs proposal on this record Customers in the position described by ARM would have at least received a portion of the rate ceilin g benefits and are not differently situated from new customers in the SDGE service territory ARM argues that a DA customer who has not received the benefit of the rate cap has not contributed to the utilitys purchased power undercollectio n If that customer later finds herself for whatever reason on bundled service and subject to the AB rate cap she should be liable for her share of undercollections incurred during the period when she was on bundl ed service But since SDGE contends that it cannot support individual tracking ARM proposes that customers that were DA during the period since June be exempt from the repayment obligations As further support ARM also cites the ACR issued on July in A seeking comments by July on a proposed settlement of pending litiga tion between the Commission and SDGE As part of the settlement SDGE would write off million plus interest from its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue Shortfall Account ERCRSA where SDGE tracks AB undercollections ARM notes that the proposed writeoff would benefit bundled customers but not DA customers ARM contends that if the Commission were to adopt the proposed settlem ent of pending litigation DA customers below kW would lose out on the ir share of the million write off That is the very kind of discrimination described in the Assembly Daily Journal and the draft Resolution seeks to guard against such inequities In view of th e harm that would be imposed on DA customers if the Commission were to adopt the settlement and to simultaneously avoid tracking individual AB benefits ARMargues that the Commission should direct that any customer who was ever a DA customer be exempt from cost recovery obligations associated with AB rate ceiling benefits As discussed in other parts of this Resolution we have addressed these issues by our treatment of DA customers with respect to the recovery of th e undercollection that results from the AB energy rate ceiling Dan Law Offices of Daniel W Douglass Topanga Canyon Blvd Suite Woodland Hills CA Tel Fax Resolution E Final doc

is this weeks legislative report Republicans are still voting against the states spending budget citing a tax increase of onequarter of a cent in the states sales tax Without a state budget in place essential state services cannot be done such as issuing checks to many contractors as well as to lawmakers legislative staffers constitutional officers and administration appointees Civil service workers will still be able to recover their paychecks however trial courts do not appear to collect any state funds to cover payroll and administrative costs Meanwhile this weeks energyrelated events and legislative highlights include EVENTS Two new whistleblowers from the former San Diego Gas Electric Company came forth on Thursday morning alleging further accusations of price manipulation and unsafe working conditions by Duke Energy These two former employees were introduced at a press conference by Lt Governor Cruz Bustamante and Assembly Member Barbara Matthews to further expand upon testimony provided by three former Duke employees last week Meanwhile the Senate Energy Price Manipulation Select Committee chaired by Senator Joe Dunn DSanta Ana will meet this upcoming Tuesday and vote on contempt citations against generators Mirant and Enron who failed to comply with subpoenas for documents According to the committee six other suppliers of energy AES Williams Reliant Dynegy Duke and ERG have until Tuesday to turn over documents The state PUC cancelled its continuation meeting on Tuesday dealing with the suspension of the right of retail end users of electricity to acquire service from providers other than the DWR or a public entity and any other items relating to the DWRs Power Supply Revenue Bonds Written letters received by the Department of Finance State Treasurers Office and the DWR all urged the PUC to postpone its hearing until midAugust so that interested parties can resolve their issues State Controller Connell released unedited versions of billion worth of power contracts with power generators negotiated by the governors energy consultants on Monday These contracts specifically state which companies are selling energy to the state as well as at what cost the duration of the contract and from where the energy is generated Further information released includes reference to millions of dollars already paid towards the longterm energy contracts in addition to the million for special energy consultants to the governor Connell says that the contracts were negotiated at the worst possible times for higher prices and longer periods than necessary The CalISO acknowledged on Monday responsibility for swings in the electrical production at a power plant owned by Duke Energy This is significant because Duke had been the subject of allegation of market manipulation by former employees in Senator Dunns surprise committee hearing last week In a document to its oversight board the ISO states records show that Duke merely was following its orders to adjust output to help balance the statewide grid and not drive up prices Governor Davis announced late last Friday that Mark Fabiani will no longer serve as one of his strategic communications consultants keeping Chris Lehane as his communications consultant with a salary equal to former Communications Director Phil Trounstine Mr Lehane will continue to provide support in addressing the states energyrelated challenges and manage all of the states agency and department public information officers as well as relinquish his SCE consulting agreement for the term

also currently working with the Chronicles Editorial board to secure an editorial Bush appointee warns state PUC on direct access FERC panelist wants consumers to retain choice of energy firms Zachary Coile Bernadette Tansey Chronicle Staff Writers Thursday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNDTL Washington President Bushs key federal energy regulator warned California that it may hurt consumers if the state approves a proposal to bar power users from shopping around for the best prices for electricity Patrick Wood a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Bushs liaison to the state on energy issues criticized a plan before the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend a major element of the states deregulation plan Called direct access the program allows businesses to cut deals with private power suppliers and permits consumers to choose among competing electricity providers including firms that market renewable sources of energy Members of the state PUC which had been set to consider the issue today said yesterday that they will delay the vote on direct access until Tuesday at the urging of Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks Wood who met with state PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch during a twoday trip to California earlier this week said he fears that ending direct access will lock consumers into higher energy prices I do worry about the future of retail competition he said yesterday in Washington I think a lot of things theyre trying to do to resolve todays problem may really push off the benefits of direct access for quite a few years Im really concerned about that At the same time Wood stressed that the federal regulators would not try to override the commissions and Legislatures decision Its their call Its a state prerogative he said The state PUC is expected to suspend direct access Tuesday because the state needs all energy users especially big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers and help pay off the billion the state has already spent on energy and billion more worth of power bought through longterm contracts Lynch said the PUC must act soon because state Treasurer Phil Angelides has warned that allowing direct access to continue without restrictions would threaten the states ability to sell billion in bonds to pay for the power purchases If some customers are allowed to desert the utilities and buy power from competitors fewer ratepayers would be left to pay off the bonds And the remaining utility customers would be stuck covering the huge costs racked up during the energy crisis We need to be sure the bonds are issued Lynch said Even though direct access has been allowed since few businesses or householders actually did it At its peak the program drew about households about percent of the customer base of Californias major utilities About percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power When the state took over buying power for the cashstrapped utilities in January the Legislature directed the PUC to suspend the direct access program LAST CHANCE FOR DIRECT ACCESS Still Hertzberg asked Lynch to delay the PUCs vote on direct access until next week so legislators who back the program can try to save it in a deal that would still provide a steady stream of revenue for the bonds Were looking at options as a lastditch effort Hertzberg said If the PUC had made the decision to suspend direct access that would have had a chilling effect on anything we want to do Wood a champion of energy deregulation said he believes that California should not abandon its effort to increase competition by allowing customers more choices about where they get their power Deregulation always benefits people he said If it doesnt youve got to rework it until it does WARNING FROM CHAIRMANTOBE Wood a softspoken Texan who is expected to become the regulatory commission chairman this fall praised California leaders for their efforts to address the crisis including getting new plants built quickly But in meetings this week he cautioned Gov Gray Davis and other state leaders against trying to punish the generators for alleged past wrongs I think the rhetoric is still pretty hot out there he said If I were a generator looking at states talking about a windfall profits tax and expropriation of property its not a great climate for investing in new

RadioMike Ward PacSat News Satellite NGI Daily Junepdf rtpdf Even better than expected Published Wednesday June in the San Jose Mercury News EDITORIAL The opinion of the Mercury News PUC should keep consumers plugged in to power choices AT the beginning the restructured California electricity market was supposed to include competition among sellers of electricity offering green power or cheaper power not just competition among generators As things played out retail competition was nearly smothered Now with the state buying electricity on behalf of utilities it could take a further blow State officials are leery of letting customers go to other suppliers now that the state will buy huge amounts of electricity over the next decade The Public Utilities Commission Thursday might suspend direct access the ability of consumers large and small to cut their own deals with electricity suppliers instead of being forced to buy through the stateutilities The PUC should leave it alone Instead the Legislature should continue discussing ways of revitalizing direct access without leaving the state with longterm contracts and not enough customers Ultimately the state should get out of the electricity business Keeping retail competition alive is one avenue of escape Theres a slightly negative zinger at the very end but overall a balanced story Published Wednesday June in the San Jose Mercury News CALIFORNIAS ENERGY CRISIS PUC likely to call a halt to shopping for power BY MICHAEL BAZELEY mailto AND JOHN WOOLFOLK mailto Mercury News State regulators Thursday are expected to pull the plug on electricity deregulations core feature the ability of customers to shop around for alternative power After July residential and business customers would no longer be allowed to shop for a new electricity provider under a measure expected to be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission State leaders fear that after stepping in and buying premiumpriced power to avoid blackouts this year big businesses will flee for a better deal sticking small consumers with the governments energy bill Those consumers would then face higher rates causing even more to flee You create a death spiral said Sen Debra Bowen DRedondo Beach Business leaders alternative energy providers and some state officials are desperately trying to head off the move saying theyve saved a bundle on energy through the direct access option of bypassing the major utilities While were coping with the rate increase we think direct access is the best way for us to manage the cost of energy said Dominic DiMare legislative advocate of the California Chamber of Commerce It leads to market discipline as well as innovation DiMare said Supporters argue the state which approved a record billion in bonds to cover power costs can guarantee payment without killing off customer choice They backed an alternative proposal Tuesday by utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas in which customers would pay a charge to cover the states energy bonds regardless of their electricity provider Customers already pay similar charges to cover an array of costs from nuclear decommissioning to conservation programs It still gives people the opportunity to buy energy that might not necessarily be cheaper but that meets their needs more said Rick Counihan spokesman for Green Mountain Energy which markets power from renewable sources such as solar and wind But even Bilas gives his proposal long odds of approval saying If I were a betting man hed say his plan would go down The ability to shop for power was the impetus for the states deregulation bill The architects of deregulation led by business groups believed that if customers could buy power directly from producers it would promote competition and drive down prices It never happened Wholesale power costs soared and that along with a host of other issues drove companies out of the state forcing tens of thousands of consumers back into the arms of utilities Now though with significantly higher electric rates going into effect this month choice is looking more attractive than ever to big businesses Joined by alternative power companies they are trying to push a bill through the Legislature that would set up a framework for continued choice Manufacturers live and die by the ability to cut costs said Gino DiCaro spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association If they have an opportunity to save money we dont feel theres any reason that should be taken away That type of freedom raises a host of thorny issues The state is now buying power on behalf of utilities and entering into dozens of longterm power contracts If businesses and residential users flee the system the state could be left with a surplus of costly power and fewer users to pay for it That in turn could mean higher rates for the remaining users Bowen is trying to address these issues in a bill that would make customers pay when they leave the system Her bill also would allow users to go into the market only during annual enrollment periods and it would limit the amount of power that could be bought on the open market Business groups are fighting those provisions Contact Michael Bazeley at mailto or Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide NGI Daily Junepdf rtpdf

this weekend ENERGY CRUNCH Direct access falls victim to crisis Powerbuying plans future is in doubt Bernadette Tansey Greg Lucas Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday June San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifcaMNLDTL The option to shop around for the best deal on electricity one of the cornerstones of Californias deregulation plan could soon be scrapped Businesses may lose the right to cut their own deals with private power suppliers and environmentally conscious consumers could be barred from shifting their business from utilities to renewable energy firms unless the Legislature acts quickly to save the program The potential cost savings of socalled direct access to competing electricity providers was the plum that incited big businesses to fight hard for deregulation in But the program although it was not responsible for the soaring rates that piled up state and utility debt may be sacrificed in the states drive to recoup its costs The fate of the program was thrown into doubt last winter when skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs collapsed the nascent direct access market weakened the utilities and caused the state to take over power purchases Industry has been lobbying hard since then to keep the option open for the future But the problem for Gov Gray Davis administration is that the state needs big industrial consumers to stay on as utility customers to help pay off the billion it has already spent buying power and the estimated billion worth of power it has contracted to buy over the next years Otherwise the utility customers left behind householders and small businesses will be stuck with the whole bill Competing proposals to allow companies to bail out by paying an exit fee to cover a share of the cost are working their way through the Legislature But time is running short state Treasurer Philip Angelides warned the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission this month The state plans to issue billion in bonds in September for power purchases and officials say underwriters want to be assured that there is a large enough revenue stream to repay the bonds Angelides and other state officials urged the Legislature and the PUC to decide by the end of June either to ban direct access or lock in a procedure to charge each departing company for its share of the state power costs The hypothetical and theoretical desires for a direct access market and the hypothetical and theoretical desire for a bond sale are now intersecting in reality said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek Santa Cruz County Industry advocates agree that firms should pay a fair share of the electricity purchased on their behalf But how much and how to make that calculation is a complex issue they fear will be decided in haste said Dorothy Rothrock a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association We are reacting to crises real or manmade and making decisions in a rush without considering the consequences Rothrock said The PUC is set to vote Thursday on a proposed urgency measure to suspend direct access as of July The ban recommended by a PUC administrative law judge would continue as long as the state functions as power buyer for utility customers conceivably through the term of state contracts ending in Lawmakers had authorized the PUC to suspend direct access last winter when the state took over electricity purchasing But a divided PUC delayed action as legislators worked with industry to salvage the program Although direct access contracts are still legal until the PUC acts in effect the program was slammed into suspension by the brutal power price hikes of the past months Threatened by exposure to rising wholesale electricity rates virtually all direct access customers have returned to the utilities where they are protected by the state rate freeze Even though the right to deal directly with generators has been on the books since few businesses or householders actually did it Many of the residential customers who signed on with alternative suppliers did so to support the growth of renewable power like solar and wind energy At its peak the program drew about households about percent of the customer base of Californias major utilities About percent of the industrial market contracted for their own power Industry has until tomorrow to file plans with the PUC to preserve direct access under a proposal by public utilities Commissioner Richard Bilas a strong supporter of the program Commissioner Jeff Brown said he favors direct access but the continuing uncertainty over the form it would take jeopardizes the states ability to float its bonds Commissioner Carl Wood a direct access opponent said it should be abolished because it creates a danger that residential and small business customers will be stuck paying for relatively highcost contracts secured by the state during the energy crisis while large industries would be free to buy cheap power from the newer more efficient plants that will be coming online in the next few years But Wood said even if the PUC suspends the option the state Legislature could order its reinstatement Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey is carrying a bill to do that while requiring the exit fees demanded by Angelides and state finance officials Without those safeguards utility revenues would dive into a death spiral where rates would keep rising as more companies abandoned the system Bowen said giving the remaining customers a deeper incentive to bail State legislators are set to meet this week to start deciding how Californias electricity market should be structured in the future But deadlines to deal with the states financial hangover are pushing decisions on direct access Bowen said its unlikely her bill will be passed within a few weeks the time frame Davis administration officials have urged to give certainty to the terms of the bond deal Angelides said the Legislature could still pass a law reviving direct access before the bond language is written in July But after that the Legislature cannot pass laws that change the terms of contract commitments made by the state he said There is still a window to act here but they have to act fast Angelides said Email Bernadette Tansey at and Greg Lucas at San Francisco Chronicle Page A

centered around the budget conference committee hearing as the deadline to pass the states budget is next Friday June th Also today was the last day for bills to pass out of their house of origin and sent to the other house for legislative hearings This weeks energy highlights include the following EVENTS Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta Lynch urging that Californias petroleum refineries and ancillary facilities be exempt from rotating outages The basis for the governors letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum products for several weeks The availability of petroleum derived transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of Californians Public safety agencies such as law enforcement emergency medical care responders and the military all rely on these fuels Without petroleum fuels the ability of these essentialuse customers to perform their critical functions would be seriously impaired said Governor Davis Governor Davis along with top executives and business leaders in the state announce a jointDeclaration on Thursday committed to saving percent in overall electricity consumption With more than businesses and organizations statewide this energyconservation coalition sets the following goals among others to reduce energy use set temperatures for occupied space to degrees from May to October reduce lighting levels by percent and an additional percent upon the declaration of a Stage II emergency close blinds and shades when possible and turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay percent of back payments to some alternativeenergy generators The PUC postponed their vote to June on a proposal that would allow alternative generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it from PGE and Edison to remain in business The California State Senate Rules Committee in cooperation with the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further background information in its investigation into whether generators are illegally profiteering from the states

Friday June PM ET Email this article to a friend Printerfriendly version LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator has filed a motion with federal energy regulators asking that four major power suppliers in California be stripped of their ability to charge market rates because they have allegedly gamed the wholesale electricity market Duke Energy DUK news msgs Dynegy Inc DYN news msgs Mirant Corp MIR news msgs and Reliant Energy Inc REI news msgs have been identified by the ISO as exercising market power the ability to influence electricity prices in Californias wholesale power market The ISO which manages the states highvoltage transmission system recently made a similar filing against AES Corp AES news msgs and Williams Cos WMB news msgs claiming those companies have profited excessively in California by exercising market power The ISO wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to revoke generators authority to charge marketbased rates for their power supply Tom Williams spokesman for Duke Energy said the company had just received the FERC filing and is reviewing the allegations Weve obviously just got the filing and were reviewing it and we are going to respond with our own FERC filing But were also gratified that market forces are at work in California and prices have come down Williams said Richard Wheatley a spokesman for Reliant said the ISOs allegations are nothing new Its similar in nature to issues and allegations that have been raised against other generators Wheatley said The ISO is incorrect in asking for emergency relief The situation in California remains to be an imbalance between supply and demand The blame game prohibits lasting solutions from being reached and the business climate in California will be affected by finger pointing Steve Maviglio press secretary to Gov Gray Davis said the governor strongly supports any attempt to bring prices down for Californians and to break the grip a handful of generators have on the electricity market The ISO has asked FERC to terminate by June Dynegys ability to charge market prices for power from its Southern California power plants and to schedule a hearing to determine rates based on the energy companys production costs The grid operator also wants Dynegy to refund billions of dollars retroactive to May of the difference between costbased ratesand the market revenues actually received Similar requests were made with FERC against Duke Reliant and Mirant The ISO has submitted compelling evidence that the exercise of market power is more pervasive than the commission has acknowledged according to the filing In the filing generators have also been accused of megawattlaundering in which suppliers sell power outofstate that is resold to California at a higher price California consumers have spent billion for wholesale electricity in billion in and could pay as much as billion this year Charles Robinson the ISOs chief counsel said he is optimistic the state will prevail in one forum or another and will be able to get the relief were seeking He said FERC should implement an effective market mitigation plan that will put the brakes on skyrocketing wholesale power prices FERC set up a market mitigation plan which went into effect June to stabilize wholesale power prices when operating reserves dip below Robinson said that plan wasnt good enough Wholesale power prices were at a sevenmonth low Thursday due in part to the new FERC plan cooler temperatures low naturalgas prices and conservation measures energy officials said Every three years FERC reviews generators ability to charge market rates for electricity Generators were first allowed to charge market rates three years ago but it is unclear whether FERC has ever stripped suppliers from their right to charge market prices

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations Thank you for coming out here today Julee MalinowskiBall Legislative AnalystAssociate CalETCEdsonModisette

refunds WPTF is completely consistent with our filing It argues facts do not support a claim for refunds with respect to Summer rates When a market clears at or below the soft cap there should be no refund liability for any seller unless that seller is shown to have manipulated th e market abused market power or colluded When suppliers bid and are paid at rates above the soft cap the definitions of marginal and opportunity costs must be clarified to recogniz e how units are dispatched throughout a year that a contribution to a generators actual fixed costs must be incorporated into the equation fo r marginal costs that forward contracts contribute to the marginal costs of a sale and that opportunity costs include broad market forces such as pric es in competing markets the ability to sell above marginal cost is not evidence of market power or market abuse ensure that transactions above the soft cap are deemed closed and no long er subject to refund within a reasonable time such as one to two months the November Order extends beyond the month potential refund period permitted by the Federal Power Act and should be shortened to conform with the requirements of the Act The filing also has sections opposing loaddifferentiated price caps and a return to costbased rates WPTF asks FERC to clarify the election process on the new Boards to ensure that governmental entities exert no more political pressure BUT I HAVE TO SHOW YOU MY FAVORITE PART OF THE FILING READ ON D Cost Based Rates A Return to Regulatory Luddism The original Luddites were bands of skilled textile workers who had been laidoff after advances in technology replaced the need for them In reaction to being laidoff they burned mills terrorized the owners and th en destroyed the steam and waterpowered laborsaving devices that had cost th em their jobs The uprisings took place mainly in the center of the wool regi on in England from In other words Luddites were casualties of the English Industrial Revolution Ned Ludd was the movements mythical founder an apprentice who smashe d his shearing frame with a hammer These wooden frames were a new technology which allowed heavy shears to be held in balance to trim a rough layer of threads from woven cloth Although Ned didnt break the machine to make a political statement he inadvertently became the first practitioner of Luddism Thirty years later in pursuit of a naive backtobasics theme Luddites organized and rioted against technological advances in the English textile industry The Luddites rioted in rejection of technology that was seen as threatening to their way of life and livelihood Now in California we have regulatory Luddites The few parties who fall i n this old world camp once controlled the energy investments in California an d now fear the advent of competition bemoan its reduction or elimination o f their previous regulatory overview and seek to smash restructuring as poor Ned smashed his machinery Their arguments are reactionary their politica l tactics oppressive By the English government put down the Luddites with hangings and transportation out of the region In the absence of such remedies today WPTF simply urges the Commission to hold true to its course and on James D Steffes AM To Alan CT bernadette nron Christopher F CT David CT Debra CT Dennis E S Ginger nron Jeff nron Jeff CT Joe nron Joseph nron

Focus On As Ive been thinking about our response today I would like Enron to focus on making sure that the California WSCC markets are as good a possible fo r business over the next to months Following that idea I think that the key points are clarifyingraising the soft cap and reducing the burdenrisk of the prospective refund period I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power retroactive refunds but I think that a FERC is not inclined to do much more on this issue b FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can give n the current political realities and c if retroactive refunds become an issue we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this fight I would recommend that the pleading and Alans testimony be modified to bri ng these issues to the top of the ticket We should still include all of our other arguments Finally I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by quietly supporting a Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes Sue Mara c an you please try and find out what EPSA IEPCA and WPTF are going to file I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not gettin g too soft Jim

End To Calif Elec Dereg Wed Sources Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison which still generates about megawatts of power in the state Shares in Edison International have fallen over the

the generation business Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by next summer Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development acquisition construction management and operation of global power production facilities As one of the worlds leading global power producers Edison Mission Energy owns nearly megawatts of generating capacity including interests in projects currently under construction or operating in Australia Indonesia Italy New Zealand Puerto Rico Spain Thailand Turkey the United Kingdom and the United States Based in Rosemead Calif Edison International is a

Mercantile Exchange SUBJECT Hertzberg Edison new proposal is de ja vu all over a gain When it comes to having nerve SoCal Edison takes second to no one The latest rescue proposal announced by Speaker Hertzberg has a familiar ri ng to it like the dinner bell at the shark tank at Sea World The Hertzberg memo and a Dow Jones story are included in this memo A summary of the primary terms of HertzbergEdisons plan is as follows o Large users of electricity kw and up would have dir ect access after two years o Residential and small businesses would be reregulated o The ransom for direct access is that businesses would be required to retire Edisons billion or so in debtand that the obligation would follow them to the land of direct access Does anything sound familiar here hintthink AB without the surplu s budget and electricity of Remember the CPUC action and A B SCE was a very active and influential player in that process Here s a short review of AB o Direct access would be allowed projected to be about after the utilities stranded costs were retired Note At the time of the bankruptcy of the PX in March direct access was not just elusiveit had been banned by the passage of AB X in January o The state created California Power Exchange was mandatory for the utilitiesthough by they began urgently to use alternatives they w ere refused on at least four occasions by CPUC action to use sources outside t he PX o Stranded costs determined inside the PX pricing mechanism were applied to all transactions that occurred outside the PX thus the obligati on followed those seeking an alternative market to the PX o The mandatory PX forced the market into a dayahead pricing schem e that effective placed the vast majority of California electricity pricing into the volatile spot market If this were not California one would have to say that this is unbelievable but the legislativeregulatory track record since in California is consistent if anything Adoption of this plan would not onl y mean that Californians did not get the baby direct access after payin g the ransom the Competition Transition Charge CTC since BUT they ve been taken hostage themselves now and another ransom is due California Kafkaesque Since the beginning of the deregulatory process in California has taken a novel approach to its energy marketsUnfortunately that novel must have been written by Franz Kafka HertzbergEdison Plan A Fair Plan for California Assembly Democratic Caucus What the California public believes about the energy crisis Utilities are to blame Outofstate generators have made huge profits We need to build more power plants to keep up with demand Deregulation is a failure The economy of the state is at risk What the public wants in a solution to the energy crisis Reregulation restore balance to system Very small if any rate increases Reliability of supply no more blackouts No permanent damage to environment more emphasis on renewable sources Penalties for those who gouged the state Guarantee this wont happen again Themes of the Fair Plan Federal role The feds have refused to obey the law to maintain fair reasonable rates Restore fairness Solutions must protect residential and small business users Reregulation Reassert our authority over Californias energy destiny Stability Reliability Increase supply and keep a lid on rates Goals of the Fair Plan Provide customers with reliable power and stable rates Restore regulated utilities to creditworthiness to enable them to resume role of energy supplier Ensure that megausers of electricity have direct access to independent electricity providers to protect Californias economy Many elements of the proposed Edison MOU remain unchanged except for Option to purchase the transmission system Reregulates service for all residential and small business consumers Provides direct access to providers for megausers above kW Megausers pay DRC to cover SCE debt Added elements to the MOU Transmission option at book value Federal tax refund must be applied to debt SCE purchases net short only for residences and small businesses if necessary PUC retains jurisdiction over rates EIX provides assurance to keep SCE creditworthy Residential Small Protection Plan Protects of all customers those who never peak above kilowatts who utilize of load Will be served by SCE through native generation bilateral contracts including QFs and Sunrise Present average PUC bundled rate D cents per KW hour Under Fair Plan average rate would be cents per KW hour including ABX payments MegaUsers Direct Access Plan Megausers peak demand KW or more represent SCE customers and of total load Megausers would gain direct access to the wholesale market MegaUsers Direct Access Plan continued Current average PUC rate D centsKW hour Fair Plan average wholesale price in D cents per KW hour Megausers would pay SCEs billion debt minus million dollars tax refund from EIX DRC for debt and cost of electricity fits within existing PUC rates Dow Jones Story LOS ANGELES Dow JonesA plan that would put most of the burden of rescui ng embattled Edison International EIX unit Southern California Edison on lar ge businesses has possibilities if it can gain stakeholder approval said Bo b Foster Edisons senior vice president of public affairs during a conferen ce call Tuesday The plan would have customers who use more than kilowatthours a month of electricity finance the cost of power the utility must purchase or have purchased on its behalf in the wholesale market The noncore customers would also help the utility recoup most of its billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market as the primary beneficiaries of the lowcost power the utility generates itself or has secured through longterm contracts Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DVan Nuys strongly supports the plan and has asked a former Sacramento mayor to help him take the temperature of Edison stakeholders to see if the approach has merit or can be acceptable Foste r said Some of the legislative leadership believes this is an attractive option i n both houses Foster said Business groups worry that the plan could cost the state billions in lost economic activity because it may force companies to relocate to other stat es The corenoncore proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers a s alternatives to a memorandum of understanding reached between Edison and Go v Gray Davis in April The MOU which would have the state buy the utilitys transmission lines has been pronounced dead by many in the legislature though Edison and Davis administration say they are still devoted to seeing it through

Chronicle Its making its way in the press My Award for Most Expected Response the consumer advocates who now argue that the generators are manipulating prices downward Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Forwarded by Susan J MaraNAEnron on PM smara Sent by PM To smara cc Subject SF Gate Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited This article was sent to you by someone who found it on SF Gate The original article can be found on SFGatecom here cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL Wednesday June SF Chronicle Dramatic drop in cost of electricityLOWER BILLS Cheaper fuel milder weather credited David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest level in more than a year partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices for natural gas which fuels most power plants Make no mistake Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in months ahead But for the first time since Californias energy markets went haywire last summer industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs California is not yet out of the woods said Kelley Doolan who tracks natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts But this is a very significant decrease in costs Along with lower gas prices the decline in electricity costs was attributed by state and industry officials to milder weather which reduces demand for power They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and betterthanexpected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants Gary Ackerman executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum an energyindustry association said these factors came together to produce the lowest wholesale electricity prices since April Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as little as per megawatt hour he noted compared with more than earlier this year If the weather stays this way we could have reasonable prices all summer Ackerman said We may also have fewer blackouts It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in energy prices If power companies manipulated prices on the way up as critics have alleged might they not be up to some trick as prices head in the opposite direction Nettie Hoge executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fall so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in the dysfunctional California market Theyre trying to take the heat off she said Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistical blip This was just one months decline said Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego We really have to see how this plays out in the future Steve Maviglio a spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said the governor was very encouraged by the lower energy prices Davis announced Sunday that Californias power use was down percent last month from a year before Were not there yet Maviglio said of whether an end to the states power woes is in sight But the trend is pointing in the right direction WHITE ELEPHANT Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side California could end up with a huge white elephant after spending about billion in public funds on longterm power contracts The logic behind the contracts which are at an average price of per megawatt hour over years is that the state expected to pay belowmarket rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and California found itself paying abovemarket rates If current trends continue though California will find itself paying consistently abovemarket rates much sooner than expected making the long term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so handsomely during the states darkest hours The contracts look really ugly right now said Shames at the Utility Consumers Action Network They may be way overpriced Maviglio the governors spokesman said it is too early to conclude that the state did poorly negotiating dozens of longterm power contracts No one has a crystal ball on this he said CUSTOMERS BILLS TO DROP In any case Pacific Gas and Electric Co said yesterday that customers average gas bills will drop percent this month to and should stay near that level all summer Platts which monitors average monthly spot prices found that the wholesale price of gas at the CaliforniaOregon border has tumbled nearly percent since the beginning of May from per million British thermal units to The wholesale gas price at the CaliforniaArizona border fell percent from to This compares with a percent monthly decline in average natural gas prices nationwide However California gas prices are still about percent higher than they were a year ago whereas national prices are now below yearago levels for the first time since last spring While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall Doolan attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge in prices last month related to fears of a long hot summer of rolling blackouts You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer he said That created enormous demand for electricity generation What has changed is that weve had weeks of mild weather Doolan observed The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all the gas This allowed utilities like PGE to beef up gas inventories which eased demand and resulted in substantially lower prices he said BACK ON TRACK Were back on track to be completely full for winter said Staci Homrig a PGE spokeswoman Thats a very good thing Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in the winter PGE is forecasting that customers average gas bills could rise to as high as in December if current trends continue However the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that Californias unusually high costs at last may be abating Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs Email David Lazarus at Copyright SF Chronicle

the language keeping DA alive the decision is attached its short D page March Finally due to pending legislation which would alter Section we shall stay action on implementation of the suspension of direct access under Water Code Section until further order Jeff Please fill in the discussion of the MOU below bullet The term Surcharge is only applicable until the end of the AB rate freeze which will end no later than March and may end earlier if a federal court finds in PGESCE favor or b California legislature mandates an earlier enddate or c the CPUC decides to actually complete its proceeding to value the retained assets and calculate an end to the rate freeze which would take months Surcharge is a term of art to get around the problems of the AB rate freeze At the end of the AB rate freeze it is my understanding that the CPUC will modify fully the rate structure and level to ensure full cost recovery on a going forward basis therefore Utility Retained Generation QF expense CDWR current expenses both energy purchase and financing costs will be included Some members of the CPUC signaled in the May decision noted below that they intended to investigate bottoms up rate making this is preferred by AReM and many others Theoretically it would clearly separate generationprocurementretail sales functions from other charges such as T and D DA sustomers would only be charged for T D etc not the other If done correctly even charges included now in T D such as some ISOrelated functions would be moved out to make the TD charges pure wires charges This approach would be preferred Any bottoms up proceeding would take months and unlikely to be concluded before the end of this year Other outstanding costs will include Utility Undercollection from May until when no additional CAISO costs are applied or until rates cover costs and CDWR costs beginning Jan until the end of AB rate freeze or the end of DWRs purchasing activities Understanding how all these costs will be recovered and by whom will most likely probability be decided by the Legislature with some decisionmaking by the CPUC If theLegislature does not take this up it will be decided by the bankruptcy court or federal court Utility Undercollection Bypass So far the Legislature has done nothing to address the utility undercollection except for San Diego which has a balancing account but no way to cfollect it yet SCEs MOU does address this by INSERT BY JEFF The MOU has received bad reviews by the Legislature but Enron has been supporting it with some changes and a bipartisan group of Legislators has been analyzing it and intends to propose amendments Probablility that utility undercollection is dealt with by the Legislature Various bills in the Legislature have been introduced to delete the language in ABX that gave the CPUC the right to terminate DA A diverse group of business interests called the Direct Access Coalition has been pushing for this and for a bill that takes care of DWRs potential stranded cost problem but provides flexibility for direct access Our current assessment is as follows Bypass allowed for payment of DWR costs Jan thru rate freeze end probability for people who never were on Utility Service for people who used Utility Service post Jan but build selfgen or incorporate energy efficiencyload management also chance for day amnesty period for people to select direct access and chance for free direct access without surcharge or exit fee for those who switch while DWR has a net short position CDWR Net Unavoidable Bypass for people who used Utility Service post Jan for others LEGISLATION IMPACTING THIS DECISION There are three key direct access bills being considered the Bowen bill SBx the Kelley bill ABx and the Battin bill SBx The Bowen bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in ABx and replace it with the following if a customer has not bought from an electric utility on or after Jan there are no charges except there may be an entrance fee to use the electric utility going forward and if a customer wants to switch from an electric utility to an ESP they must pay to the department any uncollected amounts equivalent to the departments net unavoidable cost of power procurement including any financing costs attributable to that customer to ensure the satisfaction of any power purchase obligation or bond obligation to serve that customer The recovery period shall be coincident with the terms of bonds issued to finance the purchases The CPUC has days from the effective date to notify customers of their obligations The Kelley bill would remove the DA suspension authority granted in ABx and replace it with the following if a customer has not bought from an electric utility on or after Jan there are no charges every customer is allowed to buy from an ESP a of their load equal to the amount served by Utility Retained Generation not CDWR purchases with no charges after the effective date any customer that buys from the electric utility and wants to switch must pay to ensure satisfaction of any power purchase obligation or bond obligation incurred by the department with the following constraints a for res and small commercial customers if DA load is less than load growth or b to self gen customers if the customer has given days prior notification or c if the customer has given DWR months advance written notice then only a fee equal to months unavoidable costs The CPUC has days from the effective date to notify customers of their obligations The Battin bill would still reviewing Keep in mind that all of these bills are in flux As described above the DA Coaltion is pushing hard for a good direct access bill that provides some flexibility and has its own language that it is floating Even with exit fees the Coalitions proposed language would require DWR to base the fee on a calculation of its actual costs from losing the load Enron is also pushing to make direct access part of any compromise settlement and the Republicans have taken the same approach CPUC DECISIONS IMPACTING THIS March Decision Implementing ABX decided not begin the process to terminate direct access May Order DA doesnt pay DWR expenses going forward and the cent surcharge does not apply to DA customersGood for bypass of these costs We expect the utilities to file Petitions to Modify the decision to argue that they cannot implement it they will likely seek to have the charge appply to DA Customers and then put the same amount in the credit Given the problems we all have with the negative credit and the utilities notion of a zero bill there will be much opposition to the utilities proposal The utilities chance of success on this is less than Proposed action Alliance for Retail Energy Markets AReM will begin pushing to stop charging the current cent surcharge to DA customers to be consistent with the May decision Chance of success is Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax

Email Robert Morgan Email Sue Mara Email cc Subject Governor Davis Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today wi th Financial Analysts Summary Governor Davis Lead Bond Counsel Holds Teleconference Today with Financial Analysts Summary The host of the teleconference was Mr Joseph Fichera CEO of Saber Partners serving as Governors independent Bond Counsel Mr Ficheras goal appeared to be to calm the financial markets as the Governor is hoping under a best case scenario to put the bonds out to market sometime in June Fichera told me yesterday that he does these calls on an as needed basis There appeared to be some concern that the media is getting ahead of the story and the inference could be made that this is causing problems for the Governors MOU legislation which they also said they hope to have signed by June and perhaps for the emerging Plan B as well A replay of this teleconference is available at wwwenergyinfocagovca Mr Fichera broke down his statement into the following sections California State Senate Pieces of Governors MOU legislation moving in separate committees in the Senate this is positive for moving it forward Assembly Plan B Group Assemblymembers Keeley Dutra and Nation are working together and have good ideas to move the Governors MOU legislation through Fichera said that the Governors office is meeting with both parties but the plan is still in the formative stages He added that they still have the Senate to deal with and no movement on the proposal is imminent They are hopeful that it will be moving toward resolution in a week or two Generators Fichera stated that since the Governors meeting with the generators a subgroup has agreed to continue to meet with Governors staff and advisors to resolve the issues He stated that the issue of litigation and investigations by the AGs office is off the table for discussion and that topics of discussion are limited to supply issues and managing the coming summer QFs Governors team has facilitated days of discussions with SCE and QFs over past two weeks most QFs are represented at these negotiations They continue to discuss the back payments owed and lower prices going forward to give pricing stability to CDWR and the market Their hope is that due to negotiations the QFS will all be fully available to the market this summer PGE They see the bankruptcy judges refusal to allow certain QFs to get out of their contracts as a positive development QFs online There are currently MWs offline this is better than their model anticipated for May They expect more than online by June Last month QF MWs offline Fichera explained that standard QF contracts have severe penalties if not on by June during peaks but that they are allowed to be off during offpeak hours He added that they are still trying to resolve their issues Key aspects of budget plan by this I believe he meant energy financing not the annual budget conservation and contracts Conservation They built in a reduction in demand and reduction for price elasticityconservatively projecting in conservation He stated the we saw conservation in March and April so we think our model is conservative Fichera added that the new electricity rates go out in June and they expect that this will cause a good reaction due to price signals and demand reduction They also built in in natural load growth to their projections as well to further ensure a conservative estimate Energy Costs Projected billion vs actual billion equals a variance of May Energy Costs As of May th right on budget target with a variance of less than a half percent Contracts Fichera stated that DWR continues to execute new contracts and reduce the net short exposure in the spot market He added that of necessary contracts are not yet executed but rather in the agreement in principal stage He released the following stats Needed executed contracts completed these percentages must refer to projected load accounted for for May for June for July for August When agreements in principle added in for June for July for August Questions from analysts Have you builtin an assumption that QFs will be able to opt out of contracts No we do not because we are fighting the optout positions The bankruptcy judge refused to allow this and the AG is probably going to be involved to stop that A few hundred MWs have gone into the market We are aware of this issue which is why were pushing the MOUsthis litigation would stop if we get an agreement on the MOU because the back payment issue would be settled Timing with SDGE where are you on MOU or Agreement in Principle We have to constantly reevaluate our negotiations due to other decisions happening simultaneously around us We are resuming face to face negotiations on Monday and we are still resolved to reach an agreement There is no drop dead date Generators working group Were discussing DWR credit issues summer support for MOUthe generators have issues with outstanding payments due The Governor expects them to provide haircut re those payments and thats part of discussion QF resolution will gas QFs be released from contracts We dont know what PGE is going to do but they could do that release at any timeno indications yethavent affirmed all the contracts yet We want to avoid this in the SCE situation There are a lot of overlapping QFs that supply both utilities We are trying to set a standard as to what we are looking for Bond issue timing The current plan assuming there is no further action by the legislature is to close sales days after bond sales on Aug We have sufficient cash to carry us through this period We are making a bridge loan from the General Fund In June we see improved revenue stream from ISO rate increases will also improve cash stream Can you give us any prices on new contracts Not on new contracts we are resisting for market reasons giving out individual prices for individual contracts Our website has aggregated average prices for contracts signed so far Where is the legislature Legislators want to see sharing of the painso far the focus has been mostly on generators The undercollection is associated so far with the generators legislators are beginning to see that only about of the undercollection is tied to generators So should QFs and commercial banks share the pain Some think some are less guilty than others We can only deal with Edison The media has gotten a little ahead of the process this is going to take longer than a few weeks Handicap Lead horse The Assembly is more organized and focused right now on enhancements and changes to the Governors plan the Senate is not as organized though we have engaged with Senator Burtonwe met with him times this week And the Senate Majority leader has sponsored a bill to implement the Governors plan If QFs freed up from contracts under bankruptcy or otherwise released from contractshow does this affect your financial plans I think it would change it dramatically It would be a budget busting event Thats why were resisting in court and pushing the MOU and hope that the legislature sees why bankruptcy is not a viable solution Does this need to be solved before bond issue The combination of ABx and x gives us ironclad bonding authority and the legal ability to recover all costs We think that only a few QFs can survive without longterm contracts so its also possible that not all would go into spot market few may be able to survive as merchant generators Windfall profits taxhelpfulness of generatorsdid they perform adequately during summer of What are your expectations of their performance The Governor did not have a quantitative answer in mindhe left that open as to how hell evaluate their performance People at DWR and ISO will probably have the strongest influence on the Governor in this matter Bond issue timing We are working with the treasurer and hope to sell bonds by end of June if stars are alignedit may be one megadeal or several tronches spthis is still open for discussion Even with the rising prices that we expect this summer most of our net short will be under contract or reduced due to demand side management and thus we dont expect our budget to be busted Extended bridge financing commitmentirrelevant because we dont have authority to issue for days Renewable QFsgas pricesis there anything can you dolevelize gas prices so they can operate under Srack sp price formula Many options have been discussed to bring them into the market we need such issues to become part of the global settlement and to continue to be worked out Polanco MOU legislation is it identical to the Governors view or already changed This is the implementing legislation for the Governors MOUnot changed so far Governor did not put MOU on table as legislation that could be changed He went on to explain that anything taken out must be replaced in some other fashion to keep the MOU balanced This is going to take some time however we do have a sense of urgencywe are hoping for a vote sometime in June The MOU has deadline of August Tracy Fairchild Senior Account Supervisor Edelman Public Relations Worldwide

the bid for power had been sitting there for months and that Reliant had an understanding with DWR and the ISO that the bid was not supposed to be taken except in dire need its for a peaker and the price represents the opportunity cost of running it now and using up its very limited emission credits rather than running it during the real peak times this summer The represents the estimated cost to Reliant of Reliant having to buy power this summer on the market when it otherwise would have had its peaker available The wors is that the stateISO took the bid when there was not dire need just to make Reliant look evil and point to ever higher prices when yes the week before the Bush plan was to come out Sue Mara Enron Corp Tel Fax Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Fwd Reliants Reaction To Being Singled Out By Governor Davis Message from Tracey Bradley on Fri May To Justin Long Paul Fox cc Ronald Carroll Subject Reliants Reaction To Being Singled Out By Governor Davis May pm Eastern Time Press Release Reliant Energy Urges Governor Davis to Trade Political Fingerpointing for Solutions HOUSTONBUSINESS WIREMay Reliant Energy strongly disagrees with California Governor Gray Davis recent characterization of the company as being obstructionist and opposing court orders Reliant Energy believes that these accusations are politically motivated attempts to demonize Reliant Energy as an outsider responsible for causing the states energy crisis The accusations are simply not based on fact More importantly the governors attacks have done nothing to increase the states supply of electricity or prevent the blackouts expected this summer If anything the comments have fostered an atmosphere of distrust and uncertainty that have further destabilized the market Reliant hopes the governor and others will stop these baseless accusations and focus on true solutions to Californias energy shortage said Joe Bob Perkins president and chief operating officer Reliant Energy Wholesale Group We are now being singled out because we believe in an open market not government control of power generation and we have offered solutions that do not jibe with the governors political agenda Contrary to the perception Governor Davis is attempting to promote we have been focused on providing solutions that are fair to all parties in California since the outset of this crisis In fact earlier this week we provided the governors office with an outline of a series of emergency measures that if pursued quickly could help mitigate the power crisis this summer We are still waiting on a response Perkins pointed out many of the steps Reliant Energy has taken to keep the lights on in California disputing the accusation of being obstructionist Reliant Energy has run its toyearold plants at the highest levels since their purchase in In Reliant nearly doubled the output from these plants to meet the needs of Californians running them at levels far exceeding the prior owner Southern California Edison Reliant Energy invested million dollars in alone to upgrade plants to make sure the most power possible is available during peak times In addition the company improved emissions levels to clean up the environment and keep costs for emission credits to a minimum For the last two years Reliant has encouraged the Investor Owned Utilities and the state to invest in longterm contracts to stabilize rates instead of relying on the spot market In particular Reliant Energy offered to sell power at two cents per kilowatthour if the buyer would purchase the natural gas required to generate the power ensuring a transparent cost of power Reliant Energy has never shut down generation despite the prevalent concerns that continue to exist over credit issues In contrast just last week a major outofstate supplier refused to continue to sell to California unless payment was forthcoming Reliant Energy has created an aggressive curtailment plan to encourage businesses to sell back power voluntarily to add more power to the Western power grid The company has met with many leaders in Western states to introduce the program yet California officials will not even engage in a dialogue on the program We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues oneonone with the governor Perkins said Unfortunately he has repeatedly refused this request over the past year Last weeks meeting with generators was the first time the group was allowed to speak with him directly and obviously the purpose of that meeting was political grandstanding Perkins added that the governors accusations of opposing court orders are unfounded We have always worked within the law and are proud of our commitment to keeping the lights on We have followed all court orders and worked closely with the FERC and others to cooperate fully with all investigations When necessary we have filed court challenges to orders that we believe violate our rights hardly an illegal action To participate in a telephone press conference tomorrow Friday May at am PDT contact Maxine Enciso at or Richard Wheatley at Contact For Reliant Energy Los Angeles Maxine Enciso Media Richard Wheatley

<24351594.1075843103350.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,susan.mara@enron.com,2000-09-08 07:06:00,Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Cc Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

EARLY LAST OCTOBER every member of a ninth grade girls track team and the freshman the football team at suburban Houstons Deer Park High Schools north campus returned from practice reporting severe breathing problems That day Deer Park registered parts of ozone per billion more than twice the federal standard and Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States One of the biggest sources of Deer Parks pollution is a plant owned by Enron Houstons wealthiest company d and the single largest contributor and counting to the political ambitions of Texas Governor and Republican presidential nominee George W Bush Kenneth Lay the chief executive of Enron has personally given over to Bushs political campaigns more than any other individual He is one of Bushs Pioneers d elite fundraisers who have collected at least in direct contributions of or less for Dubya Enron is best known as the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the country Its revenues of billion make it the th largest company in the United States Enron is invested in energy projects around the world including the UK Argentina Bolivia Brazil the Philippines Indonesia China India and Mozambique The company has recently expanded from energy to bandwidth capacity for the Internet making it one of the worlds largest Internetbased trading companies buying and selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to petrochemicals and plastics as well as esoteric products like clean air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits Texas activists say that this tight connection between Bush and Lay bodes ill for the country if Bush is elected Andrew Wheat from Texans for Public Justice a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin compared the symbiotic relationship between Enron and the Governor to cogenerationa process used by utilities to harness waste heat vented by their generators to produce more power In a more sinister form of cogeneration corporations are converting economic into political power Wheat explained A Bush election fueled by Enron dollars could fill the White House with dangerous levels of Enron gas When that gas ignites in the publicpolicy arena consumers will get burned Indeed Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said that if elected president the governor is keen to promote the kind of policies that he has crafted with companies like Enron for the state of Texas The governor believes in competition free enterprise better service and technology improvements He has promoted sweeping and effective reforms in education and has been the first governor in Texas to seriously address limits on emissions He will carry his agenda to Washington to do what he believes is best for the country But is what Bush believes is good for Texas good for the United States Of America Texas has one of the worst environmental records in the country particularly in air pollution Unfortunately the Bush platform for the country is very similar to the kinds of programs that he has worked on with Enron d cutting corporate taxes deregulating industry and replacing social programs with private sector volunteerism In addition Enron is invested in energy projects around the globesome of which have been tainted by charges of human rights abuses In India construction of Enrons controversial Dhabol power plant has brought charges by international groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International of complicity with police brutality in rural communities And according to Californiabased Amazon watch Enron is charged with human rights violations in Bolivia where it is building a major gas pipeline threatening indigenous communities and the rainforest environment Special deals The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena Texas lies in the Houston Ship Channel area the nations largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city The Enron Methanol plant has won special concessions from Governor Bush allowing the company to pollute without a permit as well as giving the company immunity from prosecution for violating the law Indeed plants like this in Texas actually emit twice as many nitrogen oxides a key ingredient of smog as do all the nine million cars in Texas put together Only seven percent of the more than tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in were permitted Enron got away with this under the grandfather clause of the Texas Clean Air Act which allows plants built before to continue their polluting practices Governor Bush extended this clause under the Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise CARE program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state CARE waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May giving sweeping protections to polluters who perform internal environmental or safety audits The law makes these audit documents confidential from the public and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations To date Enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission TNRCC the state equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency Tamara Maschini who lives about five miles from the Enron plant is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean Air Clear Lake Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like Enron she says Its gotten so bad that NASA has a problem recruiting people to work here at Mission Control which is just down the road Houston is in trouble and George Bush is the reason d he has allowed the situation to deteriorate over the past several years according to Maschini Mark Palmer head of public relations for Enron says that the companys contribution to local pollution is minimal If the grandfather clause was canceled right now we would benefit the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total he said Neil Carman a former employee of the Texas Air Control Board who now works for the Sierra Club agrees that Enrons grandfathered nitrogen emissions add up to less than one percent of the total for all of Texas However he points out that Enron Methanol plant alone contributes of the nitrogen oxide emissions from the nearly stationary sources of pollution for the city of Houston d the equivalent of cars Whats more he says that Enron is simply paying lip service to the Bush proposal to cut pollution at grand fathered plants Enron showed up at the governors press conference to volunteer for the CARE program but they have been missing in action ever since They havent even bothered to file their voluntary plan Giving and receiving If environmental regulators wanted to speak to Enrons senior officials about the missing voluntary program they would be well advised to follow the presidential candidate around as he is often chaperoned by Enron officials On April Ken Lay Enrons chief executive played host to Bush junior and his father former president George Bush at the Houston Astros first home game of the season at the baseball teams brand new stadium d Enron Field d which was built with the help of a million donation from Enron The company got free advertising a tax break and a million dollar contract to supply power to the stadium in return Less than three weeks later Lay joined Bush in Washington DC for a Republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering million easily the biggest onenight haul for any political party in history Thats not all Lay makes sure that the Bush presidential campaign has access to other Enron facilities Last year the Bush campaign borrowed Enrons corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country more times than any of the other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful Under federal law campaigns must reimburse companies for transportation typically at the cost of a firstclass ticket so Enron received from the Bush campaign for this favor Lays ties to Bush junior begin with his father former President George Bush who was also a recipient of EnronLays financial largesse Like his son now Bush senior was also happy to return the favor appointing Lay to the Presidents Export Council from to When asked about the relationship between the two men Ray Sullivan a spokesman for the Bush campaign chose his words carefully Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been active in Republican politics He is chair of the Governors Business Council But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for Texas and for the country Lay toed a similar line when recently interviewed by the New York Times When I make contributions to a candidate it is not for some special favor its not even for access d although Ill be the first to admit it probably helps access It is because Im supporting candidates I strongly believe in personally Indeed both Lay and Enron are generous contributors to local and national politicians wherever they do business often following the long standing corporate practice of funding candidates on both sides of the election According to campaign records Enron and Lay have contributed to Democrats as diverse as Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro US Rep Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis In Lay was Harris County chairman of a aplate ReaganBush fundraiser while at the same time cochairing a fundraiser for US Sen Lloyd Bentsen the vice presidential candidate on the opposing ticket Bush delivers just the kind of results that Lay wants Candidate Bush says he will work with local jurisdictions using marketbased solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our way to clean air and water He proposes allowing industries to voluntarily police themselves just like he did for Enron and the other polluters in Texas Texas has regularly ranked as the most environmentally polluted states in this country for years According to the Environmental Defense Fund Texas has the worst record of all states in air pollution water pollution overall toxic releases recognized carcinogens in the air suspected carcinogens in the air developmental toxins in the air affecting brain and nervoussystem development in children and cancer risk While it is true that Texas was the most polluted state in the country before George W Bush became governor the reason it has stayed that way is simple Bushs policies have effectively allowed these industries to continue to pollute through a system of voluntary compliance Read the fine print Ken Lay and Enrons political beliefs overlap with candidate Bush in other arenas such as education For example on August the Houston Astros will host a book drive at Enron Field to promote one of George W Bush and Enrons favorite charities d the Reach Out And Read ROAR literacy program Launched in by Laura Welch Bush the governors wife the program calls for physicians and nurse practitioners to give free culturally appropriate books to their preschool age patients at every checkup Enron also regularly volunteers its employees to read to children in area clinics and conducts book drives The cost to Enron for this five year publicity program was Susan Cooley the director of Texas ROAR was gushing in her support for the company the governor and his wife Ive been a nurse for years I dont know anything about sponsorship or advertising But at Enron they have whole departments to do this so finding a corporate sponsor has been a godsend she said However Enron is less than supportive of schools that do not provide similar public relations opportunities And its political reach goes beyond the governors mansion Some miles north of the companys headquarters in Houston Enron has effectively cut approximately from the annual budget of the Spring school district one of Houstons ethnically diverse poorer suburbs Spring Texas sits on top of Bammel Field a huge underground salt cave which Enron uses to store large quantities of natural gas As the largest business in Spring Enron was required to pay taxes based on the value of its property and mineral holdings on January st of each year But under a special provision Enron and other large business property owners were allowed to choose September st as their tax assessment date when the company has less gas stored in Bammel field Enron was able to reduce its property taxes by million in blowing a hole in the school districts budget according to Katherine Trumbull a tax accountant with the school district The Spring school district went to court to challenge the new tax provision as unconstitutional and won at the appeals court level Enron appealed this decision to the Texas Supreme Court While the case was pending Enrons Political Action Committee PAC and senior executives contributed heavily to the election campaigns of every Republican judges vying for seats all the members of the Texas Supreme Court are elected and may take money from contributors for the campaign expenses Enrons employees and PAC doled out between the seven of the winning justices in the campaign including more than from Ken Lay personally The Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously in Enrons favor on May a month after Lay gave Chief Justice Thomas Phillips for his campaign I have nothing against Enron after all they are our biggest taxpayer They can afford to pay for good lawyers and lobbyists and we cant says Trumbull simply Enrons Palmer had no comment about the tax lawsuit brought by the Spring Independent School District Enrons global muscle Enron has also courted Bushs help for its business abroad In March Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation to explain how export credit agencies of the United States are critical to US developers like Enron who are pursuing international projects in developing countries These agencies include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC a federal agency which provides political risk coverage and financial support to United States companies investing abroad d including hundreds of millions of dollars for Enron projects in countries from Brazil to India Unfortunately for communities in these countries Enrons investments have had devastating impact In India where Enron received million in political risk insurance for the Dabhol offshore oil and gas development project in the company has been blamed by both Human Rights Watch as well as Amnesty International for financing local police brutality Just before dawn on June police stormed the home of several women in Veldur a fishing village in western state of Maharashtra India The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road While dragging me the police kept beating me on my back with batons says Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar a year old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest according to Amnesty International The humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way I was humiliated my one and a half year old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away The only crime committed by these women was to lead a peaceful protest against a massive new Enron natural gas plant An investigative team from Amnesty International found that a number of the women subsequently sustained injuries including bruising abrasions and lacerations on arms and legs Several hundred other peaceful protestors have been arrested and temporarily detained by Indian police since December according to the report Meanwhile a January investigation by Human Rights Watch revealed that the police were directly on the Enron payroll Likewise Enron has been severely criticized for the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project in Bolivia and Brazil for which it received US million in insurance from OPIC in On February an oil pipeline operated by Transredes a joint venture between Enron and Shell in the Cuiab Integrated Energy Project erupted in the Bolivian altiplano and dumped an estimated barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River which supports indigenous communities like the Uru Moratos Facing starvation from the loss of their life sustaining waterfowl and fish the Uru Moratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched miles to the city of Oruro to ask for government help TK result Mutual selfinterest In January Enron pitched in to help pay for Bushs inaugural bash in Austin Texas when he won the reelection for governor If George W wins this November it is very likely Ken Lay will be on hand when Bush is inaugurated as the next president of the United States hoping that in return for Lays generous campaign Support Bush will be equally generous in his support for Enrons businesses at home and abroad in the future Craig McDonald director of Texans for Public Justice says that the relationship is bound to pay off Those two have a mutual selfinterest in being buddies Bush has always delivered on Ken Lays political pitches Enron depends upon government policies to enhance their bottom line in lots of ways The company relies upon this kind of access to government he recently told an Associated Press reporter It is people from the Uru Moratas of Bolivia to the school children of Deer Park and Spring Texas who will ultimately pay the price through the continued destruction of their communities and environment This story was made possible by the Corporate Watch Fund for

Monday The West desk would not give me any valuation estimates until Tim returned EES PTR Phase I Enron was the only party that raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers RAP The CPUC shined us on Later we ensured that it became part of ARMs case in PTR Phase I The way the cap worked the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high they would pay a credit that when added to the other bill components did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer thereby costing ESPs potentially a lot of money It was clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits Because of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW the UDCs settled with ARM on this issue in NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons Efforts Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in to extend the credit given for sales of green power The credit was scheduled to end by In the money specified in AB was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain took the lead in pressing for legislation We actively supported Green Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups working with envrionmental organizations and spearheading legislative amendments Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISOPX issues the green credit portion of the bill remained intact We had also decided jointly to propose a tenyear credit and were very pleased and surprised that it survived into the final bill Governor Davis is expected to sign the bill NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons Efforts RAP Enron through ARM has successfully made its case

the release of some but not all FTRs in April of this year ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs The new congestion management approach which Enron

Efforts ISO Price Caps ENA was long in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June Government Affairs working with Dave Parquet and others was instrumental in significantly delaying the movement to lower price caps thereby giving ENA time to move out of those positions The following events happened in We entered the year with a price cap of having fought to raise it to that level in In March the ISO considered lowering the price cap to but voted to leave it at because they believed at the time that market power had been adequately mitigated After the four very highpriced days in June the ISO considered lowering the price cap to with a vote on June but the vote failed by ONE VOTE Instead the Board lowered the price cap to The Board voted again on July to lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE Finally on August the Board approved the price cap effective August In June Government Affairs intitiated an allout lobbying effort to convince Board members and their constituents to oppose lower price caps We also lobbied interest groups banks venture capitalists NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with individual Board Members and the Board itself going so far as to set up a special arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board telephonically NPV estimated by Tim Belden To be determined Attributed to Enrons Efforts New MarketOriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time Government Affairs actively sought marketoriented individuals to run for the Board and replace those that do not support competitive markets Enron was successful in getting about five to run The Members selected or confrmed by the EOB have been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats However one seat of interest has been decided Dave Parquet suggested a potential municipal representative who was extremely marketoriented Michael Wood City Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh Government Affairs worked with him closely to decide which seat to run for help him prepare his application suggest lobbying tactics assist in lobbying and support him with other Board Members He won the election and became a Board Member in early September This effort is significant because the munis voted nearly in support of lower price caps The position he took was one of those votes All other things being equal we have now added a vote on our side that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or additional price caps given the close votes that have taken place thus far NPV estimated based on Tim Beldens Pice Cap Assessment To be determined Attibuted to Enrons Efforts

Also includes changes to the writeups for ENA and what I got from Tim Belden I also have a note discussing Tim Beldens philosophy in giving me valuations EES RAP Enron raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX credit for direct customers during the very first proceedings during which the method of CTC collection was raised The CPUC shined us on Later we raised it in the very first Revenue Adjustment Proceeding RAP RAP and ensured that it became part of WPTFs case as well The way the cap worked the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high they would pay a credit that when added to the other bill components did not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer thereby costing ESPs a lot of money potentially It was clear in the previous CPUC direct access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits Because of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high PX prices was LOW the UDCs settled on this issue in NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts Green Credit Legislation Enron and other green suppliers began work in to extend the credit given for sales of green power The credit was scheduled to end by In the money specified in AB was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain took the lead in pressing for legislation We actively supported Green Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups working with environmental organisations and spearheading legislative amendments Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISOPX issues the green credit portion of the bill remained intact We had also decided jointly to propose a tenyear credit and were very pleased and surprised that it survived into the final bill Governor Davis is expected to sign the bill NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts RAP Enron through ARM has successfully made its case that retail procurement and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that all customers pay Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their bills in addition to the PX credit Enron was the first party to raise these issues as part of RAP and got a Commission decision in that case to determine the credit in RAP In RAP Enron chose to use ARM to litigate the case as a cheaper alternative Hearings were completed in the Spring of ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision An additional credit of from to MWh is expected The decision will be voted out within the next two months NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides million Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts San Diego Marketing Government Affairs worked closely with EES origination to help the staff understand the wildly fluctuating regulatory and political arena in San Diego and to assist its efforts to take advantage of the unique marketing opportunity afforded by volatile wholesale market prices EES created a new Enron milestone Beginning at a point with no personnel working on San Diego deals EES moved in and was able to sign deals worth million in three weeks time EES has received kudos from the highest levels of Enron for this effort which continues today Martin Wenzel and Doug Condon of EES origination have stated their belief that these deals would not have happened with the assistance of Government Affairs NPV estimated by Doug Condon million and growing Attributed to Enrons GA Efforts ENA Note Tim Belden VP West Trading Desk discussed with me how these valuations would be used He found it difficult to assess Gov Affairs contribution to the ENA dollars made In the end he settled on the concept that Government Affairs works sometimes for years to present ENA with an opportunity to make money and then it is up to ENA to run with it So the value Tim provides is the value ENA made with the opportunity I think this is consistent with the way Dennis Benevides calculated the value for me FTR Release April I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I joined the Company in When I joined Enron the plan of market participants was to have financialonly rights I began working immediately to move people in the direction of physical rights A very long and painful fight ensued including a number of personal appearances by Bill Hogan This culminated with an ISO decision to have physicaltype FTRs and to release some but not all FTRs in April of this year ENA actively participated in the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs The new congestion management approach which Enron also spearheaded will require release of FTRs but will not take effect until next year This valuation looks only at the FTR release in NPV estimated by Tim Belden million Attributed to Enrons Efforts ISO Price Caps Price caps have been discussed in California beginning a few days after the market opened in April Over the course of the last two years Government Affairs had as a number one priority to provide rapid advance information on price caps educate Board members on the effects of price caps and when appropriate work to move price caps By June ENA had a substantial long position in the market in the West and had millions at risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June Government Affairs working with Dave Parquet and others was instrumental in delaying the movement to lower price caps by six weeks thereby giving ENA time to move out of those positions in an orderly fashion The following events happened in We entered the year with a price cap of having fought to raise it to that level in In March the ISO considered lowering the price cap to but voted to leave it at because the Board believed at the time that market power had been adequately mitigated After the three very highpriced days

arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address the Board telephonically The vote on June failed by ONE VOTE Instead the Board lowered the price cap to The Board voted again on July to lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE Finally on August the Board approved the price cap effective August In the end it was the enduse customers Enron and the generators who opposed price caps Utilities and munis favored them Enron was the only party lobbying against the lower price caps the generators gave up early in the fight and had significant credibility with the enduse customer reps on the Board NPV estimated by Tim Belden million Attributed to Enrons Efforts New MarketOriented Board Member The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time Government

Douglas Condon AM To Martin ES James M ES George ES Gary ES Mona L ES Susan J ES Jeff ES John ES Edward ES Dennis Benevides Lyle ES cc Subject Risk Management Where were these discussions when AB was being created California Utilities Losses On Electricity Pose Risk By REBECCA SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Californias two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying electricity in the states deregulated market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half their net worth in just four months If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers as currently seems likely they could become technically insolvent sometime next year That would put pressure on regulators to orchestrate a multibilliondollar public bailout similar to the too big to fail response that in the past pushed governments to rescue banks Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bondrating concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas Electric Co a unit of San Franciscobased PGE Corp and Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International of Rosemead Calif Bond rating concerns say they arent sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected utilities before they will have difficulty paying their bills If this is just a seasonal aberration the utilities can get through it says Lori Woodland analyst for Fitch IBCA If it goes on for six or nine months its a very serious situation Adds AJ Sabatelle senior credit officer at Moodys Investors Service Inc At some point you have a financial crisis The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting expenses and dont envision problems in servicing their debts But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game hoping somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall The California utilities experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are allowed to charge their ratepayers For now utilities are making ends meet by going to the financial markets to borrow money PGE a giant utility that serves one out of every Americans is seeking approval to increase its debt capacity by billion It is borrowing million while Edison is tapping million from the commercial paper market This is going to be a long tough road says Jim Scilacci chief financial officer for Southern California Edison Todays situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when California deregulated its energy market on March which opened electricity pricing to competition California tried to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investorowned utilities such as PGE and Edison to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers under the old regulatory system To do this the state legislature set retail rates at high levels which at first generated fat surpluses for the utilities As the money piled up utilities used it to pay down debts for generation facilities that were otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world By the end of this June PGE and Edison together had collected more than billion and were on track to finish paying down debts well ahead of the March deadline set by the legislature At that point rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to fluctuate with the market But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged topping the rates the utilities were allowed to charge retail customers Average prices at statesanctioned energy markets were four to five times the prices of a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could charge customers The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PGE that analysts expect its deficit to exceed billion by Oct more than half its shareholder equity of billion which is defined as assets minus liabilities Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of billion equivalent to almost twothirds its net worth of billion The utilities though they have been accumulating deficits arent required to report these as losses on their earnings statements That leaves utilities in a bind They want to end the rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers But should the freeze end before the statutory deadline of they get clobbered That is because they will immediately have to book a loss on their powerpurchase deficits Whats more they cant use the proceeds from planned powerplant sales to cover those losses instead should the freeze end they will be obliged to refund some of the proceeds to ratepayers In PGEs case the refunds could total million while in Edisons case the amount is million Publicly at least utility executives insist a mechanism will be found to let them recoup the money spent on electricity Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight Nettie Hoge executive director for San Francisco consumer group Utility Reform Network says ratepayers shouldnt end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that benefited them before prices shot up Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that got them into such a mess which was drafted with their assistance PGE Chairman Robert Glynn says it is best not to overanalyze the old deal Instead he says regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities and construct a new agreement since its in the broad interests of the state not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper Mr Glynn says the current deal offers mutually assured destruction to both utilities and ratepayers Something must be done he says or consumers throughout most of the state will experience a San Diegostyle rate shock The utility serving that city San Diego Gas Electric Co ended its freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers Legislators intervened this summer however and temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled The utility a unit of Sempra Energy is also accumulating a deficit as a result So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities will be repaid they will be able to borrow analysts say Until we hear politicians of consequence state otherwise our position is that we believe the utilities will be made whole says Richard Cortright a director at Standard Poors corporate ratings group But that opinion could change if it looks like the utilities will have to swallow a big loss The result lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and could trigger a downward spiral Youre talking about toprated companies though said Ms Woodland of Fitch IBCA To get to insolvency a lot would have to happen In the meantime utilities are doing all they can to control the hemorrhaging They have gotten authority from regulators to buy more power under longterm contracts at fixed prices reducing their vulnerability to spotmarket volatility And they have petitioned federal regulators to declare Californias market so badly flawed that generators should be denied market pricing and even ordered to pay refunds Nevertheless several forces are working against them Although they can sign bilateral contracts prices remain high for those as well Whats more they cant buy less power than their customers need If they dont buy enough the California Independent System Operator the organization responsible for reliability will step in and make purchases for them and send them the bill Perhaps the biggest problem facing PGE and Edison though is one of timing The California legislature is out of session until December and regulators havent even really started to address the issue formally In the meantime the utilities deficit is growing by tens of millions of dollars daily Write to Rebecca

HainHOUECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoeckers Congressional Testimony Law changes needed for retroactive refunds FERCS Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Date October FERC Chairman James Hoecker D told a congressional panel that the commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against market power in a competitive environment Hoecker also urged the congressmen to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility industrys transition to competition Hoeckers plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California where some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this summer Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the states bulk power markets it is clear that currently the commission does not have that authority to do so retroactively The Federal Power Act would have to be changed a FERC staffer says For its own study which began in August Hoecker claimed that the commission if proven necessary would consider ordering refunds if market participants were indeed price gouging However the Federal Power Act FPA the law that gives the commission much of its authority does not consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is probably needed to see if the commission can do that If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept If market power is being exercised we will respond accordingly by revoking or modifying marketbased rates or reassuring the basis upon which we grant them We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA if refunds are justified by record evidence However the FPA defines the commissions authority and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures with California and other states Currently the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions made days after the commission initiates an investigation which in this case would be Oct However the law makes no mention of retroactive ratemaking and FERC officials admit that to do so the law needs to be changed Based upon what I know the authority of the commission to issue refunds for any period before days following our investigation order is highly problematic Commissioner William Massey D told Electric Power Alert There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that it would be unlawful and we would need legislation to do that The Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep Dan Burton RIN held a midafternoon Sept hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a severe energy crisis this winter The committee heard testimony from Hoecker Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Carol Browner Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets but both Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year Richardson expressed his disappointment that nothing passed while Hoecker claimed that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United States under the same rules for nondiscriminatory open access and comparable service Hoecker said The commissions open access rules are not binding on the part of the nations transmission system owned or controlled by entities other than public utilities Open access over the facilities of public power and other nonpublic utilities would promote greater competition in wholesale markets by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers and sellers Hoecker pointed to FERCs investigation into bulk power markets and Californias energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives clear legislative direction FERC will extremely limited in what it could do to solve the market problems Congress too has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices Hoecker said Most critically events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate investment in generation and transmission facilities and higher levels of reliability which is crucial to the digital economy The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability standards Currently the House is considering a bill that would make the commission a federal backstop for reliability but most congressional sources do not expect the bill to pass see related story source Electric Power Alert date October issue Vol No title FERCs Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Inside Washington Publishers

The senator urged FERC not to conclude that the problems in the wholesale market would best be solved by eliminating the states main power market the CalPX and moving to exclusively bilateral trade Such a result would be disastrous Peaces letter states The commission should keep in mind those who have manipulated the wholesale market are those who would prefer that all transactions be engaged in secret But the senator did ask that the stakeholder boards of the CalPX and the ISO be replaced In addition the senator is reportedly drafting legislation that would fold the CalPX into the ISO and may result in the closure of the CalPXs Alhambra trading floor sources close to the senator said CalPX spokesman Jesus Arredondo said the nonprofit exchange is operating exactly as the Legislature intended and that any overhaul would need the approval of the governor The California Municipal Utilities Association a lobbying group representing the interests of about municipal utilities in the
