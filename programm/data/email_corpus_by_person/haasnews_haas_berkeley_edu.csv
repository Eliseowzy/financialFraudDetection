faculty this fall fresh from Princeton University where he received his PhD and served as a lecturer in Fall His research interests include how businesses are financed and how that affects decision making In his dissertation Hennessy discussed the way in which the choice of financing for a business debt equity convertible debt or equity warrants affects investment policy I deal with two issues the amount of investment and the riskiness of investment says Hennessy Businesses with higher amounts of debt are found to lower investment levels particularly when the debt level is heavy enough to push the firm into lower bond rating categories My advice to lenders dont think people are bad they are worse than you think Hennessy believes that understanding what determines the investment policy of businesses is essential to fostering economic growth A major part of the reason why the US enjoys its high standard of living is that capital is plentiful says Hennessy Capital remains plentiful despite high taxation of capital income in the US I believe part of the reason is that the US has given investors superior protection in terms of stability of property rights and guarantees against managers running off with funds Russia offers a clear demonstration of what happens if you do not anticipate and protect against perverse managerial incentives In addition to his PhD in economics Hennessy has a Masters of Public Administration from Princeton University His BA is from Swarthmore College in economics and political science Prior to pursuing his doctoral degree he was a senior consultant in the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick In spring Hennessy will teach Corporate Finance in the Masters of Financial Engineering Program and Corporate Finance in the PhD Program His office

Wednesday afternoon after receiving a report of an unknown substance on several items of mail in an office in the faculty building Both UC Police and a hazardous materials team were called in to conduct field tests and secure the scene Officials reported that the substance was not hazardous The event gave school officials a chance to witness the Haas emergency plan in action Overall the emergency plan was very effective but there are some issues to be addressed said Jay Stowsky associate dean for school affairs and initiatives We need to make sure that all of the faculty staff and students know what to do in case of an emergency The Haas School administration has an official emergency plan All faculty and staff are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the procedures outlined in building emergency plan The full emergency plan can be downloaded at haasemrginfhtml Haas Facilities Manager Edward Madera is working on a onepage emergency preparedness fact sheet for faculty staff and students to have on hand for reference In the meantime it is important to remember a few simple rules for evacuating the building Stay calm do not rush and do not panic Safely stop your work Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so Take prescription medications your home and car keys and your wallet with you if at all possible it may be hours before you are allowed back in the building If safe close your office door and window but do not lock them Use the nearest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit Do not use the elevator Proceed to the designated Emergency Assembly Area EAA From the faculty building evacuate to Gayley Plaza located directly in front of the Haas School From the student services building evacuate to the Boalt Hall parking lot From Cheit Hall evacuate west of Cheit Hall between Minor Hall the optometry building and the Womens Faculty Club Wait for any instructions from emergency responders Do not reenter the building or

STUDENT TUTOR AT SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL Lending a hand to high school students even in a small way can make a world of difference The Haas Schools outreach program Young Entrepreneurs at Haas YEP has done just this for years and now the MBA students are adding to this outreach by tutoring at Skyline High School in Oakland Every Monday the classfree day of the week Haas MBA students travel to Skyline High School to tutor students in math English and career planning as part of the MBA Education Club The tutoring takes place during the Skyline lunch hours The tutoring program started last year after JP Tennant MBA and former emergency relief teacher at Skyline organized a small group of students to give some of their time to help Oakland students with academics This year the MBA Education Club has continued the tutoring program at Skyline and needs more volunteers If we get more support from Haas students we will expand the program to Berkeley High this year said Doug Buzbee MBA the tutoring program coordinator Without greater involvement from students though we may have difficulty sustaining the current program at Skyline let alone expanding into Berkeley Skyline High School students teachers and administrators alike appreciate the tutoring provided by Haas MBA students Jim Delbridge a th grade math teacher provides his classroom during lunch hours so that students can get help from Haas volunteers The level of help needed is basic reading algebra analytical geometry and some calculus but Skyline students benefit and genuinely appreciate the help Tutoring at Skyline is obviously rewarding unto itself says MBA student Jon Metzler But as a Haas student its also a way to keep connected with the local community which I think lends perspective to what we do at Haas If students are interested in becoming a Haas tutor please contact Doug Buzbee at In addition to the Education Clubs tutoring initiative at Skyline eight Young Entrepreneur Program mentors meet twice a month here at Haas with fifteen Skyline students These Skyline students are part of the students involved in the Haasbased Young Entrepreneurs Program this year The YEP class members hail from over schools across the Oakland Berkeley and West Contra Costa school districts YEP which was founded in teaches basic business skills to th and th graders and is supported by more than forty Haas MBA

faculty this fall fresh from Princeton University where he received his PhD and served as a lecturer in Fall His research interests include how businesses are financed and how that affects decision making In his dissertation Hennessy discussed the way in which the choice of financing for a business debt equity convertible debt or equity warrants affects investment policy I deal with two issues the amount of investment and the riskiness of investment says Hennessy Businesses with higher amounts of debt are found to lower investment levels particularly when the debt level is heavy enough to push the firm into lower bond rating categories My advice to lenders dont think people are bad they are worse than you think Hennessy believes that understanding what determines the investment policy of businesses is essential to fostering economic growth A major part of the reason why the US enjoys its high standard of living is that capital is plentiful says Hennessy Capital remains plentiful despite high taxation of capital income in the US I believe part of the reason is that the US has given investors superior protection in terms of stability of property rights and guarantees against managers running off with funds Russia offers a clear demonstration of what happens if you do not anticipate and protect against perverse managerial incentives In addition to his PhD in economics Hennessy has a Masters of Public Administration from Princeton University His BA is from Swarthmore College in economics and political science Prior to pursuing his doctoral degree he was a senior consultant in the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick In spring Hennessy will teach Corporate Finance in the Masters of Financial Engineering Program and Corporate Finance in the PhD Program His office
