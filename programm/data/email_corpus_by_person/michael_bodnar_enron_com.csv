problem adding a subtype on the ITs of SBA Im not sure I understand your last bullet Can you give me more info LT Original Message From Cabrera Reyna Sent Tuesday August PM To Neville Sue Medeles Gerry Cc Threet Kay Bodnar Michael Trevino Linda Subject SBA Priority during Allocations Sue During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations some of the following issues came up Gerry correct me if I misunderstood anything If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority at Primary Points Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate Might have some mad shippers How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation Interruptible Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as SBA IT This is for the future contracts system Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria Reyna Cabrera
