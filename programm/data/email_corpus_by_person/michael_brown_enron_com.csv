we have the most effective and efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit I would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can put the situation in context so that they know our concerns in addition to any they may have It is also important to be clear as to what has already been identified and is being addressed and how While I understand that part of the idea of doorstep is to rattle the cages of the commercial management it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it was in this case John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is discussed in Houston unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise I take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does lead to some delay on occasion while facts are being gathered What I would also like in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of the review is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing There is always a question of prioritisation of resource particularly in businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge going forward you will have similar issues on Steel etc and I would like the doorstep team to provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan but I would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication happens in the future Thanks Michael Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Sally Beck To Michael R CT cc Mike CT Fernley CT Ted CT Subject Doorstep Review Process Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses EBS and EES will be included in The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test ie following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens Doing a deal test tells us what does happen And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens that we identify where operational and perhaps financial risk is created These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen As such they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AAs reviews and to produce less paperwork It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk and the quick solutions to correct these that are valuable in these reviews These reviews also look for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems Briefly the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps Crossfunctional doorstep review team arrives at subject office This is usually unannounced but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the teams arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their cooperation in making information and personnel available to complete the review The review is conducted including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key controloperations personnel to understand the business processes The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed Potential action items are suggested This information is reviewed with the head of the office as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items knowing that with this focus heshe can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so Starting late in the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me Teds viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view Ted and I assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items Then on a quarterly basis Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter doorstep findings that had been handled updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter Through most of the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly Steps through were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enrons practices Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well At my suggestion she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona relative to Rick Buys email message Michael I understand that you may have felt blindsided by the email from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business And if that was the case I apologize for that While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shonas call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep teams concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick This meeting should have been with Ted and me In leaving a voice mail for the two Ricks about setting up a meeting Shona mentioned some concerns Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy We dont however control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react To reiterate the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization The key is quick discovery and quick resolution The findings create a dialogue between the business units RAC and Operations which I believe is healthy We purposefully have chosen not to overwordsmith the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews Frankly I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AAs reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EELs business Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process

<31090263.1075858018256.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.brown@enron.com,2001-05-29 07:25:00,Possible Margaux Takeout Cc as I mentioned in my earlier note we have had a team crawling all over the Margaux transaction both to see if we can reduce the outrageous cost and also to see if we can find some earnings We dont have your earnings meeting today and I am not sure yet if it is going to be later in the week when I am out of the office so I thought I would give you a heads up on a deal we are working on It is early days and there are some significant accounting and timing issues but we believe that we have found a way to reduce our costs going forward and recognise potentially up to million of earnings In brief this will be by unwinding a liability in respect of an existing swap for about m less than it will cost to settle the swap and pay out the third party debt and equity holders and pay breakage costs It will involve us in taking back some incremental risk and in taking approx m of debt on balance sheet I believe this is all manageable In addition the transaction will require third party consents which could take time however we are aiming to close Q We will brief Glisan and Causey today as we need some support from them on a couple of issues This is not yet above a probabilty but I am hopeful that this is doable We will keep you informed Michael
<32807503.1075858020150.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.brown@enron.com,2001-05-23 03:18:00,Cc know John and I now have quarterly business reviews with each of our business and commercial support units and I thought it might be helpful to provide you with a brief overview of Q and the areas of focus going forward prior to your visit IBIT Enron Europe delivered Q IBIT of m m over target This is after covering Margaux losses of m not in plan Net Income at m was m over target after absorbing Margaux losses This is due to m interest savings from the Camelot transaction which has now moved more of the metal inventory financing costs into gross margin the adoption of FAS which produced a net gain of m as a result of marking to market contracts which were previously accounted for on an accruals basis On a like for like basis compared to our Gas and Power businesses UK Continental ETOL and Enron Direct have circa doubled IBIT from m to m and Net Income from m to m Metals generated a net loss before taxes of m This comprised gross margin of m expenses of m and interest of m net of receipts This does not include interest on funds used for the MG acquisition EXPENSES Reduction in our expense base continues to be a significant focus resulting in lower than plan expenses of m If you exclude metals which is m over plan and the m bonus accrual against m in the plan you will note that we reduced our expenses by approximately m in the rest of our business The plan itself was materially lower than that presented to John and I by the business and support groups We are therefore making significant progress in respect of reducing our expenses we expect continued savings to be made particularly as we are able to start extracting savings from the metals business HEADCOUNT We are about down on plan for headcount and I would expect this trend to continue Again we will see significant headcount reductions when the metals systems are functioning Metals headcount is with an additional full time staff working on Metals support Headcount will be reduced by over in the Middle East NB The headcount numbers include full time temp and contract staff which make up about of our headcount TRAVEL ENTERTAINMENT Total costs are down on budget with the total number of flights down by on budget The major spender is Metals which accounts for of all costs OVERSEAS OFFICES We are in the middle of a full scale review of each of our offices and will close or downsize those that do not make sense from a PL or franchise perspective IT IT is of our headcount and accounts for of our salaries and wages of our GA spend and of our consultancy spend We have already made significant progress in this area our headcount has been flat over the last months and we have introduced a series of measures to increase the accountability and focus of the IT group and to ensure resource is allocated effectively Mark Pickering is presently working with Booz Allen to identify and address additional areas of savings Finally and most importantly in this area we are working with the commercial groups to ensure that they own the IT projects and development which will minimise waste and increase focus MIDDLEBACK OFFICE Middle and back office operations constitute of our headcount and of our salaries and wages Fernley has kicked off a review which he believes will save us on headcount and costs FINANCING COSTS Our financing costs in Q amounted to m and with the focus on funds flow targets this number will be higher in the future This area is one which will receive massive focus going forward The key areas are reduction in Metals financing costs effective use of the desks to create funds flow rather than use of expensive bank deals focus on reducing cost of external funding creation of an EnronEurope treasury function GROSS MARGIN On the gross margin side whilst the targets are extremely challenging our core business is well positioned provided we can address the excessive cost burden In respect of the trading side of our business UK Power continues to be our most significant source of income and whilst NETA has created some significant challenges it also raises great opportunities for us Continental Power still lacks volatility but we are seeing some reasonable earnings Scandinavian Power is a significant opportunity for us and we have made m so far this quarter and we like the positions we have going forward UK Continental Gas continue to be difficult we lack an information advantage at this point Metals continues to be a difficult trading market and with the systems problems we are having we are taking relatively small positions On the origination side as you will see from the hotlist we are starting to see some significant deal flow particularly in the UK gas and power markets In addition there are a number of good renewables opportunities together with some interesting opportunities at ETOL and TPL On the continent we are also seeing an ever increasing number of deals but the big deals are still likely to arise on an opportunistic basis although I am very bullish on where certain of the markets will be over the next months For the first time we have doable origination deals in Scandinavia and this is also an increasing focus for us There are some outstanding possibilities for longterm structured Metals deals however most of them have a considerable lead time and I only expect a few deals this year while we develop the opportunitiesfranchise which will allow the Metals business to take off in I do not expect Metals to be anywhere near PL positive this year but I am extremely bullish on the franchise value and the possibilities for significant earnings going forward We have massive resource working on sorting our systems likely to be complete early and that together with a reduction in the headcount and costs will allow us to have a sustainable and profitable business going forward We also have a number of great origination opportunities for Enron Credit particularly on the portfolio side of the business which I expect to develop significant earnings this year We have disbanded the finance origination group with the individuals becoming part of the UK Continental and Renewables groups to ensure closer focus on deals the business units want rather than illiquid positions where we always seem to be giving our money to someone else that always seem to be the preserve of this sort of group The extra origination resource will help the groups deliver on some good opportunities MIDDLE EASTMARGAUXCATS Although as you know we would argue that these areas should not be for the account of Enron Europe we are working them very hard Middle East When we took over the Middle East business there was m of costs on the balance sheet with over people developing projects with no realistic probability of an acceptable return The office has been downsized and will be purely LNG going forward We have recovered m from Dolphin and have served the termination notice to recover a further m We are fighting hard to recover as much as possible of the remaining m spent on Dolphin the m on Gaza and m on Oman and m on a deal in Pakistan To the extent that we have to take a hit we will manage it over a number of quarters we are in discussion with a number of parties re all the above CATS Fernley and his team worked hard to ensure that the hit for Enron was the absolute minimum possible being m IBIT and m interest which will have to be taken this quarter The remaining m has been taken to the balance sheet as a deferred expense so this will have a capital charge in respect of it going forward MargauxWhitewing As mentioned above Enron Europe covered losses of m in Q in respect of the Margaux financing We are expecting losses in Q of approx m We have two teams working the situation very hard Global finance in London are focussing on opportunities to refinance andor identify PL positive opportunities from the structure to offset the losses We have one or two interesting possibilities In addition Eric Shaw has a team totally focussed on finding incremental value from the underlying assets to enable us to have greater scope to sell the assets We need to find somewhere in the region of m of incremental value to enable us to do this We will sell all of the underlying assets as soon as it is possible to do so JAPAN ENCOM EnCom has an annual cost base of approximately m and the expenditure is likely to increase It has a number of interesting opportunities that it is pursuing but they are extremely longterm and at a very early stage Our game plan is to get ourselves into a position as quickly as possible to be able to monetise our interest both at the holding company and project levels JAPAN ENRON As you know we believe that the power market will not open quickly enough to justify the resource that was going to be focussed on it The opportunities are clearly in the global markets area We will focus on Metals and Enron Credit in that region We will provide commercial support to Global Markets and recharge the costs AUSTRALIA We are not making enough of this market but are adding some very good origination resource to enable Paul Quilkey to take advantage of some interesting opportunities I attach an appendix setting out a more detailed breakdown of our actual numbers v plan Q v Q

<26026618.1075858048955.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,michael.brown@enron.com,2001-05-23 03:18:00,Cc know John and I now have quarterly business reviews with each of our business and commercial support units and I thought it might be helpful to provide you with a brief overview of Q and the areas of focus going forward prior to your visit IBIT Enron Europe delivered Q IBIT of m m over target This is after covering Margaux losses of m not in plan Net Income at m was m over target after absorbing Margaux losses This is due to m interest savings from the Camelot transaction which has now moved more of the metal inventory financing costs into gross margin the adoption of FAS which produced a net gain of m as a result of marking to market contracts which were previously accounted for on an accruals basis On a like for like basis compared to our Gas and Power businesses UK Continental ETOL and Enron Direct have circa doubled IBIT from m to m and Net Income from m to m Metals generated a net loss before taxes of m This comprised gross margin of m expenses of m and interest of m net of receipts This does not include interest on funds used for the MG acquisition EXPENSES Reduction in our expense base continues to be a significant focus resulting in lower than plan expenses of m If you exclude metals which is m over plan and the m bonus accrual against m in the plan you will note that we reduced our expenses by approximately m in the rest of our business The plan itself was materially lower than that presented to John and I by the business and support groups We are therefore making significant progress in respect of reducing our expenses we expect continued savings to be made particularly as we are able to start extracting savings from the metals business HEADCOUNT We are about down on plan for headcount and I would expect this trend to continue Again we will see significant headcount reductions when the metals systems are functioning Metals headcount is with an additional full time staff working on Metals support Headcount will be reduced by over in the Middle East NB The headcount numbers include full time temp and contract staff which make up about of our headcount TRAVEL ENTERTAINMENT Total costs are down on budget with the total number of flights down by on budget The major spender is Metals which accounts for of all costs OVERSEAS OFFICES We are in the middle of a full scale review of each of our offices and will close or downsize those that do not make sense from a PL or franchise perspective IT IT is of our headcount and accounts for of our salaries and wages of our GA spend and of our consultancy spend We have already made significant progress in this area our headcount has been flat over the last months and we have introduced a series of measures to increase the accountability and focus of the IT group and to ensure resource is allocated effectively Mark Pickering is presently working with Booz Allen to identify and address additional areas of savings Finally and most importantly in this area we are working with the commercial groups to ensure that they own the IT projects and development which will minimise waste and increase focus MIDDLEBACK OFFICE Middle and back office operations constitute of our headcount and of our salaries and wages Fernley has kicked off a review which he believes will save us on headcount and costs FINANCING COSTS Our financing costs in Q amounted to m and with the focus on funds flow targets this number will be higher in the future This area is one which will receive massive focus going forward The key areas are reduction in Metals financing costs effective use of the desks to create funds flow rather than use of expensive bank deals focus on reducing cost of external funding creation of an EnronEurope treasury function GROSS MARGIN On the gross margin side whilst the targets are extremely challenging our core business is well positioned provided we can address the excessive cost burden In respect of the trading side of our business UK Power continues to be our most significant source of income and whilst NETA has created some significant challenges it also raises great opportunities for us Continental Power still lacks volatility but we are seeing some reasonable earnings Scandinavian Power is a significant opportunity for us and we have made m so far this quarter and we like the positions we have going forward UK Continental Gas continue to be difficult we lack an information advantage at this point Metals continues to be a difficult trading market and with the systems problems we are having we are taking relatively small positions On the origination side as you will see from the hotlist we are starting to see some significant deal flow particularly in the UK gas and power markets In addition there are a number of good renewables opportunities together with some interesting opportunities at ETOL and TPL On the continent we are also seeing an ever increasing number of deals but the big deals are still likely to arise on an opportunistic basis although I am very bullish on where certain of the markets will be over the next months For the first time we have doable origination deals in Scandinavia and this is also an increasing focus for us There are some outstanding possibilities for longterm structured Metals deals however most of them have a considerable lead time and I only expect a few deals this year while we develop the opportunitiesfranchise which will allow the Metals business to take off in I do not expect Metals to be anywhere near PL positive this year but I am extremely bullish on the franchise value and the possibilities for significant earnings going forward We have massive resource working on sorting our systems likely to be complete early and that together with a reduction in the headcount and costs will allow us to have a sustainable and profitable business going forward We also have a number of great origination opportunities for Enron Credit particularly on the portfolio side of the business which I expect to develop significant earnings this year We have disbanded the finance origination group with the individuals becoming part of the UK Continental and Renewables groups to ensure closer focus on deals the business units want rather than illiquid positions where we always seem to be giving our money to someone else that always seem to be the preserve of this sort of group The extra origination resource will help the groups deliver on some good opportunities MIDDLE EASTMARGAUXCATS Although as you know we would argue that these areas should not be for the account of Enron Europe we are working them very hard Middle East When we took over the Middle East business there was m of costs on the balance sheet with over people developing projects with no realistic probability of an acceptable return The office has been downsized and will be purely LNG going forward We have recovered m from Dolphin and have served the termination notice to recover a further m We are fighting hard to recover as much as possible of the remaining m spent on Dolphin the m on Gaza and m on Oman and m on a deal in Pakistan To the extent that we have to take a hit we will manage it over a number of quarters we are in discussion with a number of parties re all the above CATS Fernley and his team worked hard to ensure that the hit for Enron was the absolute minimum possible being m IBIT and m interest which will have to be taken this quarter The remaining m has been taken to the balance sheet as a deferred expense so this will have a capital charge in respect of it going forward MargauxWhitewing As mentioned above Enron Europe covered losses of m in Q in respect of the Margaux financing We are expecting losses in Q of approx m We have two teams working the situation very hard Global finance in London are focussing on opportunities to refinance andor identify PL positive opportunities from the structure to offset the losses We have one or two interesting possibilities In addition Eric Shaw has a team totally focussed on finding incremental value from the underlying assets to enable us to have greater scope to sell the assets We need to find somewhere in the region of m of incremental value to enable us to do this We will sell all of the underlying assets as soon as it is possible to do so JAPAN ENCOM EnCom has an annual cost base of approximately m and the expenditure is likely to increase It has a number of interesting opportunities that it is pursuing but they are extremely longterm and at a very early stage Our game plan is to get ourselves into a position as quickly as possible to be able to monetise our interest both at the holding company and project levels JAPAN ENRON As you know we believe that the power market will not open quickly enough to justify the resource that was going to be focussed on it The opportunities are clearly in the global markets area We will focus on Metals and Enron Credit in that region We will provide commercial support to Global Markets and recharge the costs AUSTRALIA We are not making enough of this market but are adding some very good origination resource to enable Paul Quilkey to take advantage of some interesting opportunities I attach an appendix setting out a more detailed breakdown of our actual numbers v plan Q v Q on a like for like basis and a more detailed expenses and headcount breakdown If you wish to discuss please give me a call alternatively we can discuss in more detail when you are over in the next couple of weeks
