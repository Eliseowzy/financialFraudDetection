Sec tion Original Message From Kathy Roeder mailto To mailto Dvegas kingwoodcablecom mailto Cc Damon Silvers mailto Sent Tuesday March PM Subject Fwd Response to Enron Article by Michael Lewis Outlook Se ction Dennis and Kathy I need your help getting something to as many former Enron employees as pos sible At the bottom of my message I copied in an opinion editorial that a ppeared in the Washington Post on Sunday The author makes an absurd clai m that Enrons employees somehow got what they deserved in the companys co llapse We need as many former Enron employees as possible to respond to the Michae l Lewis piece and counter his bizarre argument with fact You can email le tters to the editor to mailto Include your name address and phone number I attached the letter that M r Trumka sent to the Post today Wait a Minute Didnt Enrons Employees Ride That Stock Up By Michael Lewis Sunday March Page B BERKELEY Calif Not since the corporate victims of Sept rushed to C apitol Hill to demand financial reparations have there been so many expensi ve beggars in one place as there are now in Houston Every few days brings another story of the terrible predicament of Enron Co rps current and former employees Often these stories reveal a new grieva nce they harbor or lawsuit they have filed to recover money they believe is rightfully theirs On Feb for instance came word that roughly Old Enronians are seek ing cash from a pair of Houstonbased relief funds and that former auditor Arthur Andersen LLP had put together a package to compensate among others former Enron employees These relief funds now have hundreds of thousands of dollars largely becau se politicians looking to unburden themselves of Enrons campaign contribut ions have come to view the bankrupt energy traders former employees as a p opular cause And Andersen seems never to have asked why it should be givin g money to former Enron employees rather than the other way around How come Why are Enrons employees who helped perpetrate one of the great corporate frauds of all time more deserving of reparations than say Enr ons creditors or to expand the field of vision actual poor people who ne ver worked at Enron One answer the answer generally assumed is that the blame for Enrons collapse falls exclusively on Kenneth Lay Jeffrey Skilling Andrew Fastow and one or two other honchos All lesser Enronians were like mushrooms k ept in the dark Perhaps in some cases this is even true In most cases above a very low level of employee it couldnt possibly be We now know for example that it took many hundreds of people to orchestra te the huge number of spectacularly bad investments made by Enron over the past decade Many hundreds of people were at the same time very highly paid How could it not occur to these people that there was something odd in th is arrangement We also know that some large number of employees answered former CEO Skilli ngs call to create a phony trading floor so that analysts visiting from W all Street would have the impression that Enron was doing more business tha n it actually was Many of these people to judge from their newspaper quotes seem to fee l that the Potemkin village exercise is proof of corruption at the top of E nron and thus of their case that they were defrauded by their evil masters Actually it shows that a lot of people should have known that something was wrong all along and that the corruption or delusion extended down in to the Enron ranks We also know from Enron vice president Sherron Watkinss now famous letter to Lay that Enrons corrupt partnerships were something of an open secret within the company Indeed everything we know so far about Enron suggests that many many empl oyees were at the very least willing accomplices to the schemes dreamed u p by their bosses And now they want their money back They are like access ories to a failed bank heist who demand restitution because the police conf iscated their share of the take I can think of two reasons they should be shamed into silence The first is the example it sets The Enron case as it is currently playing out sends the following message to corporate employees You arent respons ible for what you do Turn a blind eye toward corporate deceit or even par ticipate in the deception and so long as you arent one of the top bosses you will enjoy the moral status of the victim Its already hard to be a whistleblower This incentive structure makes it even harder One of the striking things about Enron is that no one came fo rward and blew the whistle on the company Watkins has been cast in the ro le but all she really did is beg her boss to orchestrate an artful coverup so she could continue to make lots of money Why will the people who work at the next Enron behave any differently The second reason to ignore the yelps and whimpers of Old Enronians is basi c justice The phony accounts Enron ginned up for many years allowed it to pay its employees as if they actually were conducting hugely profitable bus iness Even those who were profitably engaged were probably grossly overpai d for their efforts In short theyve already made out like bandits Why g ive them more money I know I know the retirement plan Eight hundred and fifty million dollar s in worker savings vanished Somehow the media reports suggest Enron forced its employees to keep their savings in Enron shares In fact there was a brief period last fall from O ct through Nov in which the k plan was frozen and Enrons emp loyees were unable to sell their shares The stock during that span fell to a share from a small step in the long plunge from more than to pennies today The only shares workers were restricted from selling outside that window were those pumped into the plan by the company as a mat ch for part of each employees contribution Those shares couldnt be sold until the worker turned For the most part workers held shares voluntarily and could have sold them and diversified their portfolios at any time The reason they didnt is that they were greedy They had seen Enrons stock rocket and decided the s mart thing to do was bet that it would keep rocketing Its sad for them th at it didnt but should the rest of us be responsible for them any more t han we feel responsible for people who sunk their life savings into TheStre etcom Inc Probably there are a few Old Enronians lowly clerks some bluecollar ty pes out in the field the mentally incompetent who deserve a helping han d But Ill bet they arent the ones who are now hollering for it Michael Lewis is a
