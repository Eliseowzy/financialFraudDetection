levels of redundancy he states it is important to note that the Central Control Centers are more o f a communication and dispatch hub but the actual control of the circuit b reakers transformers phase angle regulators and voltage control devices the reliability backbone resides within the sub control centers of the Transmission Operators like Con Edison Florida Power Light etc etcThe destruction of one of the major RTO control centers will not shut down tra nsmission lines or trip generators off line There would be loss of communi cation to the region or local control centers and there may be some out of merit generation moves but it would not be a disaster With the redundanc y of control centers computers communications and data acquisition along with the proper protocols and procedures the loss should not severely effe ct the security or reliability of the transmission grid This redundancy wi ll be an important part of the RTO development but there is no valid reason to slow up the present pace of progress because of this issue I believe there are much more vulnerable areas within the Transmission grid that NERC should be concerned about and address I am open to continue th is discussion off line Dan Original Message From Perrino Dave SentWednesday September PM ToNicolay Christi L Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Robertson Linda Shelk John Yeung Charles Ingersoll Richard

Pat SubjectRE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs Christi The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RT O formation process and EISB Frankly nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasnt already been tho ught out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well All four of these entities have fully functional backup facilities in othe r parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them I would assume E RCOT also has a fully functional redundant control scheme in place as well In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main cont rol center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system They have or used to have plans which in the event neither center is ava ilable can revert control back to the TOs heaven forbid until ISO perso nnel can resume control of the grid So they have sets of redundancy in addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for r edundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundanc y NERCs assertion that they would slowdown the RTO formation process i s absurd geez its going too slow now Running distributed synchronized computer networks is not rocket science how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zer o attack There was no report of crippling loss of financial information at least that I am aware of Even a small operation like APX operates the ir systems using distributed computing and synchronized data For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resu lting service denials cited are probably refusals of tags which from w hat I understand the utilities probably cause much more selfinflicted hav oc than this virus The press release you refer to just confirms NERCs position of maintaining status quo Should we call NERC on these statements The remarks made in these public statements seem irresponsible Kind Regards Dave Original Message From Nicolay Christi L Sent Wednesday September AM

able to shed more light on why NERC is making stat ements that on their face look antilarge RTO the other emails and comment s in these document look more like this should be reviewed Do we and other market participants need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues etc to counter this Cer tainly Pat Wood and Nora Brownells testimony to Congress indicate that th ey believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability we hav e included this in our SE RTO mediation comments Original Message From Michael Reddy mailto Sent Tuesday September PM To

Weiner Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Jim Steffes Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Mark Bennett Senior Manager of Policy Donn Salvosa Manager of Government Affairs DATE September RE NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs The attached email in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC ma de during a recent meeting with members of the national press The stateme nts concern NERCs view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERCs Four RTO policy set forth in its July th Order The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization particularly the possibility that NERCs responsibilities could be shifted to EISB Also attached is an article containing the views of RJ Rudden Associates Inc that discusses the risks associated with centralizing cont rol center operations Specifically NERC representatives informed the press that on September the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some f acilitiesfrom an information administration standpoint They noted tha t this resulted in service denials although it is not clear whether they i ndicated where or how much This event was attributed to the socalled NI MBA virus NERCs statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role theyve playe d not only in security matters but possibly other aspects pertaining to r eliability standards They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERCs July th Order Moreover it is likely that NERC will argue that given its expertise and experience recent events ma ke transitioning to a new standards organization EISB ill advised It is unclear what if any impact all this may have on RTO development th e legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the N ERC Boards consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meetin g However we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters
