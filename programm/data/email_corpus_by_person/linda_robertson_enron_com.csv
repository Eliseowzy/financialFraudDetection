Crisisdevelopment We are trying to get Steve an appointment with Smith next Tuesday Forwarded by Linda RobertsonNAEnron on PM Allison Navin PM To Linda NRON cc Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in Southern California Senator Feinstein added Specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls Directs FERC to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be loaddifferentiated based on supply and demand or costofservicebased rates in the Western energy market Western Systems Coordinating Council including Arizona California Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming Addresses the issue of high natural gas transmission costs by reimposing FE RC tariffs for natural gas transportation into California FERC Order and requiring natural gas sellers to declare separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate for gray market transactions Stipulates that the wholesale price cap or costofservice based rate will not apply to wholesale sales for delivery in a state that imposes a price limit on the sale of electric energy at retail that precludes a regulated utility from recovering costs under the price cap or on a costof service based rate or precludes a regulated utility from paying its bills Establishes that the ratemaking body of a state can determine how and when the wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers including the setting of tiered pricing real time pricing and baseline rates With respect to the Bonneville Power Administration BPA will be encouraged to seek to reduce rate spikes to economically distressed communities while ensuring costs ar e recovered by the end of the next contract period in Directs that after the date of enactment utilities cannot be ordered to se ll electricity or natural gas into a state without a determination by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the seller will be paid Directs that in the event that a state in the Western energy market does no t meet the criteria described in this agreement state public utilities commissions in the Western energy market can ensure that regulated utilitie s within their jurisdiction meet demand for electric energy in the utility s service area before making sales into any such state Establishes that the wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates shal l remain in effect until such time as the market for electric energy in the western energy market reflects just and reasonable rates as determined by the Commission or until March whichever is earlier

<24315169.1075847643220.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.robertson@enron.com,2001-01-26 08:00:00,Possible Qs for Hearingare possible Qs Dan W will prepare first cut at answers Questions for January Hearing Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the

Crisisdevelopment We are trying to get Steve an appointment with Smith next Tuesday Forwarded by Linda RobertsonNAEnron on PM Allison Navin PM To Linda NRON cc Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in Southern California Senator Feinstein added Specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls Directs FERC to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be loaddifferentiated based on supply and demand or costofservicebased rates in the Western energy market Western Systems Coordinating Council including Arizona California Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming Addresses the issue of high natural gas transmission costs by reimposing FE RC tariffs for natural gas transportation into California FERC Order and requiring natural gas sellers to declare separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate for gray market transactions Stipulates that the wholesale price cap or costofservice based rate will not apply to wholesale sales for delivery in a state that imposes a price limit on the sale of electric energy at retail that precludes a regulated utility from recovering costs under the price cap or on a costof service based rate or precludes a regulated utility from paying its bills Establishes that the ratemaking body of a state can determine how and when the wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers including the setting of tiered pricing real time pricing and baseline rates With respect to the Bonneville Power Administration BPA will be encouraged to seek to reduce rate spikes to economically distressed communities while ensuring costs ar e recovered by the end of the next contract period in Directs that after the date of enactment utilities cannot be ordered to se ll electricity or natural gas into a state without a determination by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the seller will be paid Directs that in the event that a state in the Western energy market does no t meet the criteria described in this agreement state public utilities commissions in the Western energy market can ensure that regulated utilitie s within their jurisdiction meet demand for electric energy in the utility s service area before making sales into any such state Establishes that the wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates shal l remain in effect until such time as the market for electric energy in the western energy market reflects just and reasonable rates as determined by the Commission or until March whichever is earlier

<7686153.1075847791287.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.robertson@enron.com,2001-01-26 08:00:00,Possible Qs for Hearingare possible Qs Dan W will prepare first cut at answers Questions for January Hearing Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort

<423599.1075847951125.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.robertson@enron.com,2001-01-26 08:00:00,Possible Qs for Hearingare possible Qs Dan W will prepare first cut at answers Questions for January Hearing Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort

Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in Southern California Senator Feinstein added Specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls Directs FERC to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be

<23333383.1075848130274.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.robertson@enron.com,2001-01-26 08:00:00,Possible Qs for Hearingare possible Qs Dan W will prepare first cut at answers Questions for January Hearing Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort

Crisisdevelopment We are trying to get Steve an appointment with Smith next Tuesday Forwarded by Linda RobertsonNAEnron on PM Allison Navin PM To Linda NRON cc Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in Southern California Senator Feinstein added Specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls Directs FERC to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be loaddifferentiated based on supply and demand or costofservicebased rates in the Western energy market Western Systems Coordinating Council including Arizona California Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming Addresses the issue of high natural gas transmission costs by reimposing FE RC tariffs for natural gas transportation into California FERC Order and requiring natural gas sellers to declare separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate for gray market transactions Stipulates that the wholesale price cap or costofservice based rate will not apply to wholesale sales for delivery in a state that imposes a price limit on the sale of electric energy at retail that precludes a regulated utility from recovering costs under the price cap or on a costof service based rate or precludes a regulated utility from paying its bills Establishes that the ratemaking body of a state can determine how and when the wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers including the setting of tiered pricing real time pricing and baseline rates With respect to the Bonneville Power Administration BPA will be encouraged to seek to reduce rate spikes to economically distressed communities while ensuring costs ar e recovered by the end of the next contract period in Directs that after the date of enactment utilities cannot be ordered to se ll electricity or natural gas into a state without a determination by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that the seller will be paid Directs that in the event that a state in the Western energy market does no t meet the criteria described in this agreement state public utilities commissions in the Western energy market can ensure that regulated utilitie s within their jurisdiction meet demand for electric energy in the utility s service area before making sales into any such state Establishes that the wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates shal l remain in effect until such time as the market for electric energy in the western energy market reflects just and reasonable rates as determined by the Commission or until March whichever is earlier

Shapiro Richard Shortridge Pat Staines Dan Steffes James D Stroup Kerry Sullivan Kathleen Twiggs Thane Walton Steve Subject Summary of RTO Week Day One Today was the first day of FERCs RTO Week in Washington DC The topic of todays panel was RTO Markets and Design Required Markets and Optional Markets The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues All commissioners were present Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance Focus is on functions rather than characteristics what should and should not be standardized Midwest Commissioners Presentation Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement David Svanda Michigan PSC made the comments He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators pursuant to section of the FPA to formalize a FERCmidwest partnership xmlnamespace prefix o ns urnschemasmicrosoftcomofficeoffice Panel One Mandatory RTO Markets The morning panel consisted of the following participants Peter Cramton University of Maryland David Hadley Indiana PSC Mark Kleinginna Ormet John Meyer Reliant John ONeal Mirant and Roy Shanker consultant for generators in the Northeast Energy Spot Market There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy or spot market Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bidbased securityconstrained system with economic dispatch In response to a question from Pat Wood most also agreed that nodal LMP pricing should be used in the spot market although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules Peter Cramton said that with a dayahead market no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior John Meyer agrees saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement then there might be a need for a dayahead market John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement which he does not recommend or have a dayahead market ICAP Requirement Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services Most of the panelists except Peter Cramton support an ICAP requirement However none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM He cannot enter into longterm contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response Standardized Markets Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and dayahead energy markets spinning and nonspinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts Panel Two Optional RTO Markets The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants Fiona Woolfe lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool Roy Thilly Wisconsin Public Power Inc Richard Pierce professor at George Washington Glen Arthur Connecticut PSC Steve Naumann Commonwealth Edison Ed Cazalet APX This panel was intended to cover optional market issues including whether a dayahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market market monitoring and other issues Mandatory Markets Other than Ed Cazalet the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and dayahead energy market ancillary services markets and there must be an ICAP requirement Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market perhaps with balanced schedules requirements and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create ICAP Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a dayahead market congestion management and ancillary services Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached and perhaps that should be considered here as well He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now before RTOs are put in place She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs with working markets are up and running Not many of the panelists agreed with this saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build Shelton Cannon Staff asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO that there could be percentage requirement deviations Midwest Commissioners Proposal to Have a Joint Board Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea None of the panelists even the Connecticut commissioner thought this was a good idea citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow Please call me with questions or comments Sarah

Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort

Talks By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July Page E California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate billion in longterm electricity contracts that the state signed this year Gov Gray Davis D said part of the billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the longterm contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis Weve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money However you want to do it its just got to net out close to billion The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr according to sources close to the negotiations Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise What Im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters In the event were unable to do that Friday at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday Wagner FERCs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted Californias largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on Last Friday Wagner rebuked Daviss chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator the states power grid manager indicating that the states demand for nearly billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said Wagners settlement conference which has involved more than lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said The suppliers have offered to refund million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said Wagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERCs commissioners FERC has tentatively called for million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of Californias electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe Daviss tactical change offering to make the longterm contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals Californias energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on shortterm power purchases at volatile spot market prices When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills In response Daviss aide S David Freeman and his staff began negotiating longterm power contacts with suppliers The billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next years Thats well under the average of per megawatthour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the billion refund Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagners negotiations Industry supporters say Daviss refund figure is impossible to justify Theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates The states advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the billion figure Its not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid Those polaropposite views have left both sides in Wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said The Washington Post Company

in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

Talks By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July Page E California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate billion in longterm electricity contracts that the state signed this year Gov Gray Davis D said part of the billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the longterm contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis Weve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money However you want to do it its just got to net out close to billion The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr according to sources close to the negotiations Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise What Im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters In the event were unable to do that Friday at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday Wagner FERCs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted Californias largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on Last Friday Wagner rebuked Daviss chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator the states power grid manager indicating that the states demand for nearly billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said Wagners settlement conference which has involved more than lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said The suppliers have offered to refund million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said Wagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERCs commissioners FERC has tentatively called for million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of Californias electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe Daviss tactical change offering to make the longterm contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals Californias energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on shortterm power purchases at volatile spot market prices When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills In response Daviss aide S David Freeman and his staff began negotiating longterm power contacts with suppliers The billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next years Thats well under the average of per megawatthour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the billion refund Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagners negotiations Industry supporters say Daviss refund figure is impossible to justify Theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates The states advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the billion figure Its not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid Those polaropposite views have left both sides in Wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said The Washington Post Company

Talks By Peter Behr Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July Page E California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate billion in longterm electricity contracts that the state signed this year Gov Gray Davis D said part of the billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the longterm contracts whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis Weve made suggestions weve offered various ways in which people could get us billion Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money However you want to do it its just got to net out close to billion The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L Wagner Jr according to sources close to the negotiations Yesterday Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise What Im trying to do is get people in a settlement mood Wagner told reporters In the event were unable to do that Friday at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday Wagner FERCs chief administrative judge has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted Californias largest utility drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at swords point with generators that help keep the states lights on Last Friday Wagner rebuked Daviss chief representative Michael Kahn chairman of California Independent Grid Operator the states power grid manager indicating that the states demand for nearly billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high sources said Wagners settlement conference which has involved more than lawyers for all sides is closed to the public and media Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a joke that the parties might as well wear clown suits according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers led by Reliant Energy Inc Williams Energy Services Duke Energy and Southern Co for failing to make serious settlement offers these sources said The suppliers have offered to refund million provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds sources said Wagners leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERCs commissioners FERC has tentatively called for million in refunds but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of Californias electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure some energy analysts believe Daviss tactical change offering to make the longterm contracts part of an overall settlement comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals Californias energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan which relied heavily on shortterm power purchases at volatile spot market prices When energy costs shot upward last summer so did the states electricity bills In response Daviss aide S David Freeman and his staff began negotiating longterm power contacts with suppliers The billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next years Thats well under the average of per megawatthour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year but above current power prices and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade energy analysts say A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the states controversial demand for the billion refund Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a refund because the deals were reached under commercial duress according to sources close to Wagners negotiations Industry supporters say Daviss refund figure is impossible to justify Theres no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be said Michael Zenger California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates The states advocates counter that if FERC enforced a just and reasonable standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the billion figure Its not rocket science but it does require the regulators to regulate said Frank Wolak a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid Those polaropposite views have left both sides in Wagners conference room billions of dollars apart as the talks approached their final weekend sources said The Washington Post Company

cc Harry nron Robert NeustaedterENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Subject Tariffs Approved The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January on behalf of Transredes has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month The rates are not much lower than what we filed for and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates The tariff methodology and revised regulations put into effect by the Supreme Decree were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down The deliverables

RANSREDES Fernando RANSREDES Subject Tariffs Approved Gentlemen I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TRs tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation The details are Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved Increase TRCLHB Proposed TRCLHB Increase Gas Export including surcharges excluding RG Liquids Domestic Liquids Export CLHBs tariffs were also approved as follows As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB comparable with our liquids domestic We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday but our inteligence suggests the following Export gas volumes increased to TR capacity and GSA Cuiaba assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes RG Compresion project deleted Interest rate reduced to or ie the rate in our bond issue Liquids expansion in the South reduced Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions OCC in service date slipped from to DebtEquity assumption changed from to Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows Volumes Covered by rule we can blete but can expect little back here Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term ie RG Compression not worth fighting for since we dont even have the support of BG Interest Rate Well get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds ie commision costs etc are omited Liquids Expansion in the South Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquidsgas production will be shut in If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers PB BG Vintage and Chaco We will then write to those producerscopy SIRESE VMEH etc stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE We will give them an estimate of the lost liquidsgas production in both volume and cash terms resultant from this decision We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal Continuity of Service Capex We need to see the detail here We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards We need to see exactly what has been removed but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services eg LPG transportation or the continued operation of some liquids laterals we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process OPEX need to see the detail on Monday OCC will not appeal we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy DebtEquity ratio Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the LawRegulation the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is However we have very strong grounds to appeal since a we are currently miles away from let alone b we can only borrow for CAPEX as per bond issue and the policy of allmost bankslending institutions with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from We intend to fight this one very hard using all the externalindependant help we can get As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions ie the worst case Regards Doug

electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort

electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests JEFFREY L RABIN DARYL KELLEY RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS Los Angeles Times Home Edition A Copyright The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit according to state records All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned In addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled Top advisors to Gov Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements A review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor Nancy McFadden State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in US history The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers The companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines Davis contends that Fichera Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws Critics question the distinction The governors approach may be convenient for him said Jim Knox executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause but it ignores the law Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest Knox said Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year More than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records In the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted Most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year Jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp a San Josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show While working for the state Department of Water Resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the states behalf More than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary Barry Goode said in an interview The highestranking consultant removed Richard Ferreira was hired on a contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ferreira was paid an hour by the state After he disclosed owning as much as in Calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts Ferreira could not be reached for comment The governors office identified the other four as traders William F Mead Herman Leung Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of Californias electricity deregulation Hired by the state in February and March the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California Mead a former Edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago He said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time Mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team Thursday and fired I asked very directly Is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer Mead said He just said your services are terminated I came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if Im some sort of criminal I guess its just politics and were the pawns Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state That trader Elaine Griffin who also came from the Power Exchange left the state power buying operation July three days after disclosing her energy industry investment Griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment Griffin reported purchasing to of Calpine stock on Feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange A few days later Calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources On Feb Griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts One of those a year deal signed Feb was the longest The state has awarded Calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock two others reported owning stock in Texasbased power marketing giant Enron Corp And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation Bernard Barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb Purchase of Enron Stock Defended I dont see a conflict he said At the time we werent really dealing with Enron I still havent bought from Enron Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job That notice came from Goode the governors lawyer We expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today If he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person However the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors Fichera and Hoffman Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects Fichera is Davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale He has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the Wall Street financial community Fichera refused to comment on the record Fichera and Hoffmans companies Saber Partners and Blackstone Group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying Pact Specifies Financial Advice The states contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates That consulting firm was hired on a million contract Like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state That firms top advisor Douglas S Montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement He reported no power company interests The governors legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract PHOTO Barry Goode above governors legal affairs secretary Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

<1757606.1075843751694.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,linda.robertson@enron.com,2001-01-26 08:00:00,Possible Qs for Hearingare possible Qs Dan W will prepare first cut at answers Questions for January Hearing Price Gouging On January your company reported fourthquarter results for in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose percent and your overall earnings rose percent How much of this was attributable to increased sales in California How much did you make from sales in California What is the highest per kilowatthour price Enron charged on the spot market What is the cost of production for that power In a recent Houston Chronicle article January Mr Skilling your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California situation not had an impact on earnings but that it may even turn out to be a benefit in the long run Can you please explain the longterm benefits you expect In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman Ken Lay was quoted as saying that California consumers need to see the price signals that is pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until we get more supplies What did Mr Lay mean by this With the tremendous profits that Enron is making in this situation isnt it pretty brazen for him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their power Market Manipulation A number of generators and wholesalers including Enron have been accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western states I understand that you are being sued in state court in San Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these allegations Does Enron currently have any generation assets offline for maintenance Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western states available for purchase by California utilities If not why did it withhold power How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite knowing of the crisis in California At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of Californias largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy what price was Enron asking for its power on the spot market What was Enrons cost of producing that power How much profit did you make in December from sales in California Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because of concerns about their credit worthiness Did your company ever tell California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit concerns Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in a crisis such as occurred in California How do you justify making such large profits driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness Utility Forbearance Auction California clearly has a significant problem with the potential bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities How much money do those utilities owe your company Has your company offered any payment forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were charging them on the spot market for power California held an Internet auction last week for longterm contracts for sale of power to the state Did Enron participate in the auction What price did you offer for power in nonpeak times What price did you bid for power during peaking periods Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for power on the spot market because longterm contracts were discouraged Now you are looking to enter into longterm contracts which many experts believe will be at rates far above the market in the future You really are going to profit coming and going How can you claim that you are not price gouging in this case In the past you have offered power to California utilities in longterm contracts at rates less than per kilowatthour How do you justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price Role in California Deregulation Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide In light of the colossal failure of the effort in California do you still support deregulation in other states or at the federal level What safeguards would you support to protect against increased rates for consumers The Future California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this problem What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand periods Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other states such as New York Political Contributions Activities Your company has been very active politically and according to press reports Mr Lay is very close to President Bush Wasnt your company one of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee How much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much money did your executives give in personal money to the Bush Campaign and the RNC How much to the inaugural Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or the socalled advisory committees What information and suggestions has your company or its officials provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy deregulation or the California situation What discussions have officials from your company had with Administration or Transition officials about the California situation Softball Questions In the short term and then in the long term what can California do to fix its power supply system What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system The Power Exchange The Independent System Operator Why did deregulation fail in California Some people including Governor Davis have suggested that outofstate power suppliers such as Enron are to blame for this crisis is that true Some people in California have suggested that the State should take over the power system Please comment on this proposal Is this a good idea In which states has deregulation worked How do you explain the success in those states in contrast with the failures in California This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some point in the future Should we undertake this effort
