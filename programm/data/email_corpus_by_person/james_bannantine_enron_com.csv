Argentina team of the political situation in Argentina It is not a political meltdown but it is a significant change in the executive branch a nd potential realignment of the political parties in Argentina The cabinet shuffle and resignation of the vice president are in the wake of the senate bribery scandal in Argentina where the opposition was supposedly bribed to vote for the governments changes in law actually in favor of economic reform The cabinet shuffle was economics oriented with the economic team being strengthened but potentially at the expense of the alliance that hol ds the government and a majority in Congress over Menems party the peronists The vice president was the senior member of the second party in the allianc e President De La Rua is senior member of the first party in the alliance Financial markets reacted slightly negatively to the shakeup with bond spreads widening slightly and Argentine stock prices down slightly As a minimum we will keep a close eye on the political and financial situation a nd be prepared for any more significant reaction by the financial markets Forwarded by James M BannantineENRONDEVELOPMENT on PM Don NRON AM To James M

is as far as this distribution went Please edit as needed and forwar d to whomever you feel necessary Forwarded by Don BlackSAEnron on AM From Michael Guerriero on AM To Don nron cc Guillermo nron Cristian nron Maria Belen nron Subject Argentina Political Analysis As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice president of Argentina The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin et changes announced on Thursday th by President De la Rua Alvarez publicly noted he could no longer tolerate the political differences with t he President over the senate bribery scandal Particularly Alvarez disagreed with De la Ruas decision to promote Alberto Flamarique from Minister of Labor to General Secretary and to keep Fernando de SantibaFez as Chief of the Intelligence Department Both Flamarique and SantibaFez are suspected of paying bribes to Senators to vote for a new Labor Law Alvarez has emotionally championed the fight against the senate scandal and has been strongly advocating for the resignation of Flamarique SantibaFez and all Senators involved in the affair It was considered that the decision of De la Ra was intended to demonstrat e that he and not Alvarez holds the power and that De la Ra wanted to demonstrate that the changes were focused on improving the economic situati on and to move beyond the Senate scandal The main changes in the cabinet announced on Thursday th are the followi ng Chistian Colombo economist in good relationship with Machinea will repla ce Terragno as Chief of Cabinet Machinea Minister of Economy will also be responsible of the Ministry of Infrastructure Jorge De la Ra former General Secretary of the President and Presidents brother will be Minister of Justice Patricia Bullrich peronist will be Minister of Labor As a consequence of Alvarez resignation Flamarique resigned to his positi on of General Secretary of the President Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic situation it could be considered the following Before Alvarez resignation the cabinet changes were considered positive intending to increase the power of the Minister of Economy and reduce the internal disagreements in the Administration Although Alvarez the leader of the Frepaso party said he will be still pa rt of the Alianza the Radical and Frepaso party alliance in Office Alvare z resignation could lead to the division of the Alianza and reduce the abilit y of De la Rua to pass new laws in the Congress A breakup of the coalition would make the Peronist the largest party in both houses of Congress only compounding the potential for government gridlock This situation will weaken De la Rua and probably foster new realignments in the political field All the situation will increase economic uncertainty and will delay economi c recovery The market will wait to see if a conflict develops in the Alianza De la Rua and his team will probably be forced to take strong decisions t o retain the political initiative strength and control Machinea will probably try to gain the market confidence announcing that D e la Ruas Administration will not change the macro foundations of the econom ic agenda and even increase its commitment toward monetary and fiscal equilibrium exchange rate policy respect for vested rights etc Financial analysts have viewed the situation as an institutional crisis wi th unknown effects on the economy The insecurity of the Argentinas politica l future caused Argentine debt paper to fall The Argentine JP Morgan Emergin g Market Bond Index widened basis points to over US Treasuries Argentinas year global bond fell only slightly There does not appear t o be a market panic as noted by the trading of Argentine ADRs in New York They were down cents rather than dollars and a number of them closing unchanged We will continue to monitor the situation and update as warranted

Argentina team of the political situation in Argentina It is not a political meltdown but it is a significant change in the executive branch a nd potential realignment of the political parties in Argentina The cabinet shuffle and resignation of the vice president are in the wake of the senate bribery scandal in Argentina where the opposition was supposedly bribed to vote for the governments changes in law actually in favor of economic reform The cabinet shuffle was economics oriented with the economic team being strengthened but potentially at the expense of the alliance that hol ds the government and a majority in Congress over Menems party the peronists The vice president was the senior member of the second party in the allianc e President De La Rua is senior member of the first

Cristian nron Maria Belen nron Subject Argentina Political Analysis As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice president of Argentina The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin et changes announced on Thursday th by President De la Rua Alvarez publicly noted he could no longer tolerate the political differences with t he President over the senate bribery scandal Particularly Alvarez disagreed with De la Ruas decision to promote Alberto Flamarique from Minister of Labor to General Secretary and to keep Fernando de SantibaFez as Chief of the Intelligence Department Both Flamarique and SantibaFez are suspected of paying bribes to Senators to vote for a new Labor Law Alvarez has emotionally championed the fight against the senate scandal and has been strongly advocating for the resignation of Flamarique SantibaFez and all Senators involved in the affair It was considered that the decision of De la Ra was intended to demonstrat e that he and not Alvarez holds the power and that De la Ra wanted to demonstrate that the changes were focused on improving the economic situati on and to move beyond the Senate scandal The main changes in the cabinet announced on Thursday th are the followi ng Chistian Colombo economist in good relationship with Machinea will repla ce Terragno as Chief of Cabinet Machinea Minister of Economy will also be responsible of the Ministry of Infrastructure Jorge De la Ra former General Secretary of the President and Presidents brother will be Minister of Justice Patricia Bullrich peronist will be Minister of Labor As a consequence of Alvarez resignation Flamarique resigned to his positi on of General Secretary of the President Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic situation it could be considered the following Before Alvarez resignation the cabinet changes were considered positive intending to increase the power of the Minister of Economy and reduce the internal disagreements in the Administration Although Alvarez the leader of the Frepaso party said he will be still pa rt of the Alianza the Radical and Frepaso party alliance in Office Alvare z resignation could lead to the division of the Alianza and reduce the abilit y of De la Rua to pass new laws in the Congress A breakup of the coalition would make the Peronist the largest party in both houses of Congress only compounding the potential for government gridlock This situation will weaken De la Rua and probably foster new realignments in the political field All the situation will increase economic uncertainty and will delay economi c recovery The market will wait to see if a conflict develops in the Alianza De la Rua and his team will probably be forced to take strong decisions t o retain the political initiative strength and control Machinea will probably try to gain the market confidence announcing that D e la Ruas Administration will not change the macro foundations of the econom ic agenda and even increase its commitment toward monetary and fiscal equilibrium exchange rate policy respect for vested rights etc Financial analysts have viewed the

Argentina team of the political situation in Argentina It is not a political meltdown but it is a significant change in the executive branch a nd potential realignment of the political parties in Argentina The cabinet shuffle and resignation of the vice president are in the wake of the senate bribery scandal in Argentina where the opposition was supposedly bribed to vote for the governments changes in law actually in favor of economic reform The cabinet shuffle was economics oriented with the economic team being strengthened but potentially at the expense of the alliance that hol ds the government and a majority in Congress over Menems party the peronists The vice president was the senior member of the second party in the allianc e President De La Rua is senior member of the first party in the alliance Financial markets reacted slightly negatively to the shakeup with bond spreads widening slightly and Argentine stock prices down slightly As a minimum we will keep a close eye on

Cristian nron Maria Belen nron Subject Argentina Political Analysis As reported Carlos Chacho Alvarez resigned his position Friday as Vice president of Argentina The main reason of this resignation was a political disagreement with Cabin et changes announced on Thursday th by President De la Rua Alvarez publicly noted he could no longer tolerate the political differences with t he President over the senate bribery scandal Particularly Alvarez disagreed with De la Ruas decision to promote Alberto Flamarique from Minister of Labor to General Secretary and to keep Fernando de SantibaFez as Chief of the Intelligence Department Both Flamarique and SantibaFez are suspected of paying bribes to Senators to vote for a new Labor Law Alvarez has emotionally championed the fight against the senate scandal and has been strongly advocating for the resignation of Flamarique SantibaFez and all Senators involved in the affair It was considered that the decision of De la Ra was intended to demonstrat e that he and not Alvarez holds the power and that De la Ra wanted to demonstrate that the changes were focused on improving the economic situati on and to move beyond the Senate scandal The main changes in the cabinet announced on Thursday th are the followi ng Chistian Colombo economist in good relationship with Machinea will repla ce Terragno as Chief of Cabinet Machinea Minister of Economy will also be responsible of the Ministry of Infrastructure Jorge De la Ra former General Secretary of the President and Presidents brother will be Minister of Justice Patricia Bullrich peronist will be Minister of Labor As a consequence of Alvarez resignation Flamarique resigned to his positi on of General Secretary of the President Regarding the preliminary impact of the political changes to the economic situation it could be considered the following Before Alvarez resignation the cabinet changes were considered positive intending to increase the power of the Minister of Economy and reduce the internal disagreements in the Administration Although Alvarez the leader of the Frepaso party said he will be still pa rt of the Alianza the Radical and Frepaso party alliance in Office Alvare z resignation could lead to the division of the Alianza and reduce the abilit y of De la Rua to pass new laws in the Congress A breakup of the coalition would make the Peronist the largest party in both houses of Congress only compounding the potential for government gridlock This situation will weaken De la Rua and probably foster new realignments in the political field All the situation will increase economic uncertainty and will delay economi c recovery The market will wait to see if a conflict develops in the Alianza De la Rua and his team will probably be forced to take strong decisions t o retain the political initiative strength and control Machinea will probably try to gain the market confidence announcing that D e la Ruas Administration will not change the macro foundations of the econom ic agenda and even increase its commitment toward monetary and fiscal equilibrium exchange rate policy respect for vested rights etc Financial analysts have viewed the situation as an institutional crisis wi th unknown effects on the economy The insecurity of the Argentinas politica l future caused Argentine debt paper to fall The Argentine JP Morgan Emergin g Market Bond Index widened basis points to over US Treasuries Argentinas year global bond fell only slightly There does not appear t o be a market panic as noted by the trading of Argentine ADRs in New
