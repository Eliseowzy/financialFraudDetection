FW Northern v ONEOKRE Oneok Bushton Measurement Could you please keep me and Mary Darveaux in the loop on all this Thanks Dari Original Message From Davis Britt Sent Friday September PM To Craig Rick Fossum Drew Cc Dietz Rick Ringblom Kathy Cessac Ke nneth Zikes Becky Carrier Lee Subject Northern v ONEOKRE Oneok Bushton Measurement Rick I think the memo is excellent In order to preserve the legal priv ileges I would reference the stillpending Northern v ONEOK matter in the Subject and restrict the distribution to only those who need to know My gut is that Sommer is out of the loop bc ONEOK lost confidence in him and Drew you were right again Given that development and that y ou are being sent some proposed revised language I am going to cancel our meeting for Monday with you me Ken Cessac and Rick It makes little sense to me for us to get together until all of us have had a chance to review a nd digest the language Many thanks Britt Original Message From Craig Rick Sent Friday September PM To Fossum Drew Davis Britt Subject Oneok Bushton Measurement Britt and Drew heres a memo Ive generated based on my conversations with Oneok this morning I just thought Id get you guys opinion on it before I expand the distribution to include marketing operations reg affairs e tc Is this way more detail than anyone will want Just wanted your guida nce since this is my maiden voyage onto this turf Thanks After trying most of the week to reach John Sommer at Oneok I received two calls this morning one from Kevin Willt Bushton Plant and the other fro m Steve Winston regarding the Bushton measurment issues Kevin just wanted to let me know that he would be their measurement contact for day to day o perations issues at the Bushton plant and wanted the phone number for Kenne th Cessac He said he would be getting with Kenneth about the AprilMay di fferences between metered volumes and PTR and would be working with Kenneth going foward on the day to day measurement issues Steve Winston wanted to discuss a number of issues Heres how that discus sion went This may be far more detail than anyone wants but since Im jus t jumping into this I want to make sure everyone knows whats taking place If you want far less detail going foward please let me know Steve asked what our plan was I told him that we were waiting for their t echnical expert to get with Ken Cessac to look at the AprilMay differences this was based on Kens call to John Sommer last week and that I had bee n trying to get with John Sommer to set up a meeting as a followup to his discussions with Phil to talk about their concerns and need for further cla rification to the Measurement Agreement Steve informed me that John Somme r would no longer be in the picture as a result of recent org changes and t hat we should work with he and Terry Spencer He stated that Blaine Bender their Kansas Operstions Manager and Kevin Wi llt their Bushton plant measurement person are supposed to be getting with Ken Cessac to look at the AprilMay differences I told him that I had ju st talked to Kevin They have hired Steve Stark as their technical expert consultant to work on this He stated that the arbitration hearing had gi ven us a clean slate and that the metered volumePTR comparisons in June July and August looked pretty good with both sides of the plant running but that April and May were a still a concern to them Theyre desire is to l ook into it and let the science prevail on these months I told him that our position based on the arbitration decision was pretty clear that be ing that our metered volumes prevail a comparison is really indifferent He did not respond all that well to this statement and said that we both ha ve to work together on this issue going forward I told him that we would certainly work with them to look at the April and May differences and that if that looksee showed anything we would certainly consider it but reempha sized that the measurment agreement is the basis for our business decisions He then wanted to know what needed to be done from the standpoint of the me asurement agreement I told him that we were open to listening to their co ncerns and if we needed to get together for a meeting that we could get on e set up I asked if he could share some of his thoughts on what they were thinking Heres a bullet list of some of the things he brought up They want to build a relationship with us where both sides openly share the ir measurement data and information as is relates to metered volumes and PT R They have no long term confidence in the ultrasonic measurment without a co mparison to PTR He also brought up the issue of two phase flow as tempera tures begin to cool this fall and condensate starts come up the pipe They propose that the agreement be redone in such a way that it is more se lf correcting and that compares the metered volumes to PTR And as long a s this comparison falls within certain tolerances then there would be no a djustments While he didnt want to commit to a tolerance he did give a Steve Winston opinion of around He described the process as a self c orrecting process Not real clear what that means He also stated that they would want to define a level of exceedance that wo uld require a joint investigation of the problem and defined resolution pro cess I asked if as a starting point he would generate a list of their proposed change provisions and send that to me He said he was already working on i t he called it Bushton PTR Measurement Settlement and would get a bullet list to me in the next couple of days that we could start looking at We agreed that we would start from here and then see where it takes us
