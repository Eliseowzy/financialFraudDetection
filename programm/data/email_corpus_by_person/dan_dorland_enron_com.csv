of Letter to Enrons Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company Following is the text of an unsigned letter written in August to Kenneth L Lay the chairman of the Enron Corporation after Jeffrey K Skilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug Its author was later identified as Sherron S Watkins a vice president for corporate development at Enron The House Energy and Commerce Committee released excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday Has Enron become a risky place to work For those of us who didnt get rich over the last few years can we afford to stay Skillings abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting improprieties and valuation issues Enron has been very aggressive in its accounting most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly some of our EES MTM positions The spotlight will be on us the market just cant accept that Skilling is leaving his dream job I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and reported with other good will writedowns to occur in How do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals They unwind in and we will have to pony up Enron stock and that wont go unnoticed To the layman on the street it will look like we recognized funds flow of million from merchant asset sales in by selling to a vehicle Condor that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later years Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance We have recognized over million of fair value gains on stocks via our swaps with Raptor Much of that stock has declined significantly Avici by percent from million to million the New Power Company by percent from a share to a share The value in the swaps wont be there for Raptor so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these losses Raptor is an LJM entity It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax Skilling is resigning now for personal reasons but I would think he wasnt having fun looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years Is there a way our accounting gurus can unwind these deals now I have thought and thought about a way to do this but I keep bumping into one big problem we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in and we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price many executives sold stock we then try and reverse or fix the deals in and its a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later Nice try but investors were hurt they bought at and a share looking for a share and now theyre at or worse We are under too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled redeployed employees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us in trouble What do we do I know this question cannot be addressed in the allemployee meeting but can you give some assurances that you and Causey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to happen to Condor and Raptor in and Summary of Alleged Issues RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity That equity is at risk however the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected there is no commitment to contribute more equity The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of Enron NP restricted stock and stock rights Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold As disclosed in we recognized million of revenue from the equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying securities This year with the value of our stock declining the underlying capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing for reserves against our MTM positions To avoid such a writedown or reserve in quarter one we enhanced the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles committing more ENE shares My understanding of the thirdquarter problem is that we must enhance the vehicles by million I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a lot of accountants including AA Co have blessed the accounting treatment None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed in the bright light of day Please review the late s problems of Waste Management where AA paid million plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the accounting treatment to a man in the street would you influence his investing decisions Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough understanding of the facts If so you best present it correctly andor change the accounting My concern is that the footnotes dont adequately explain the transactions If adequately explained the investor would know that the entities described in our related party footnote are thinly capitalized the equity holders have no skin in the game and all the value in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives unfortunately in this case a big loss AND Enron stock and NP Looking at the stock we swapped I also dont believe any other company would have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron In other words the million in revenue in would have been much lower How much lower Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well then no one would be the wiser If Enron stock did well the stock issuance to these entities would decline and the transactions would be less noticeable All has gone against us The stocks most notably Hanover the New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities law and accounting I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two courses of action The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage too great therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse unwind write down these positionstransactions The probability of discovery is too great the estimated damages to the company too great therefore we must quantify develop damage containment plans and disclose I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly increased with Skillings shocking departure Too many people are looking for a smoking gun Summary of Raptor Oddities The accounting treatment looks questionable a Enron booked a million gain from equity derivatives from a related party b That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except Enron c It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a contribution of its own shares One basic question The related party entity has lost million in its equity derivative transactions with Enron Who bears that loss I cant find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss Find out who will lose this money Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity If its Enron from our shares then I think we do not have a fact pattern that would look good to the SEC or investors The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length a Enron hedged New Power Hanover and Avici with the related party at what now appears to be the peak of the market New Power and Avici have fallen away significantly since The related party was unable to lay off this risk This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron b I dont think any other unrelated company would have entered into these transactions at these prices What else is going on here What was the compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such transactions There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor Employees question our accounting propriety consistently and constantly This alone is cause for concern a Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer Three days later Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him b Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM c I have heard one managerlevel employee from the principal investments group say I know it would be devastating to all of us but I wish we would get caught Were such a crooked company The principal investments group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor These people know and see a lot Many similar comments are made when you ask about these deals Employees quote our CFO as saying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money trail between Enron and LJMRaptor and its principals Can he look at LJM At Raptor If the CFO says no isnt that a problem Condor and Raptor Work Postpone decision on filling office of the chair if the current decision includes CFO andor CAO Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to investigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron attorneyclient privilege on the work product Cant use V E due to conflict they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals Law firm to hire one of the big but not Arthur Andersen or PricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest AA Co Enron PWC LJM Investigate the transactions our accounting treatment and our future commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock NP etc For instance In the third quarter we have a million problem with Raptor NPW if we dont enhance the capital structure of Raptor to commit more ENE shares By the way in Q we enhanced the Raptor deal committing more ENE shares to avoid a writedown Develop cleanup plan a Best case Clean up quietly if possible b Worst case Quantify develop PR and IR campaigns customer assurance plans dont want to go the way of Salomons trading shop legal actions severance actions disclosure Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if Im all wet a Jeff McMahon b Mark Koenig c Rick Buy d Greg Walley To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following Weve contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities Since its contingent we have the consideration given and received at zero We do as Causey points out include the shares in our fully diluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future This impacts earningspershare projections only We lost value in several equity investments in million of lost value These were fairvalue investments we wrote them down However we also booked gains from our price risk management transactions with Raptor recording a corresponding PRM account receivable from the Raptor entities Thats a million related party transaction its percent of IBIT percent of NI pretax percent of NI after tax Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor reviews the contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities will have enough capital to pay Enron its million when the equity derivatives expire The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt the value of the contingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payable that Raptor owes Enron Raptors inceptiontodate income statement is a million loss Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out LJM is whole on a cashoncash basis Where did the million in value come from It came from Enron shares Why havent we booked the transaction as million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and million of value in our economic interests in these entities Then we would have a writedown of our value in the Raptor entities We have not booked the latter because we do not have to yet Technically we can wait and face the music in The related party footnote tries to explain these transactions Dont you think that several interested companies be they stock analysts journalists hedge fund managers etc are busy trying to discover the reason Skilling left Dont you think their smartest people are poring over that footnote disclosure right now I can just hear the discussions it looks like they booked a million gain from this related party company and I think from all the undecipherable halfpage on Enrons contingent contributions to this related party entity I think the related party entity is capitalized with Enron stock No no no you must have it all wrong it cant be that thats just too bad too fraudulent surely AA Co wouldnt let them get away with that Go back to the drawing board its got to be something else But find it Hey just in case you might be

prosecutorial tone claims of security fraud Jason Chow National Post Former Enron Corp chairman Kenneth Lay said yesterday he would not testify at todays scheduled congressional hearing into the companys collapse blaming legislators prosecutorial comments on TV talk shows yesterday Not only were there corrupt practices we are finding what may clearly end up being security fraud Republican Rep Billy Tauzin chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told NBCs Meet the Press An internal company report released Saturday criticized Mr Lay other executives board members and auditors for the collapse It showed managers took home millions of dollars through complex partnerships while hiding at least USbillion in losses Other politicians denounced the companys management before TV cameras yesterday in response to the report Last night Mr Lay cancelled his testimony In the midst of our preparation particularly disturbing statements have been made by members of Congress even today on the eve of Mr Lays scheduled appearance his lawyer Earl Silbert said in a letter to lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee I have instructed Mr Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation Sen Byron Dorgan chairman of another Senate Commerce subcommittee investigating the biggest bankruptcy in US history said on Meet the Press the report suggests massive problems and shows a culture of corruption While Mr Dorgan said it was up to the US Justice Department to decide whether to press criminal charges he added the report showed clearly some things have happened here that are going to put some people here in real jeopardy The page report written by a team headed by the dean of the University of Texas Law School said Mr Lay bears significant responsibility for flawed decisions in approving some transactions that hid debt and offset losses The report said these transactions did not follow accounting rules and were implemented improperly resulting in Enron overstating earnings by USbillion during a oneyear period starting in September Ken Lay obviously had to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme a giant shell game said Republican Sen Peter Fitzgerald Enron once the seventhlargest US corporation began to unravel in October after it said shareholder equity was reduced by around USbillion The company said it used stock to pay off the debt of some of the complex partnerships it had created to reshuffle assets and hide debt With its stock already in a tailspin the Enron house of cards began to collapse The October writedown raised questions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similar affiliated partnerships On Nov it restated earnings back to lowering them by USmillion The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec Its shares sank below US from more than US a year ago wiping out over USbillion worth of investors stock including the retirement savings of thousands of Enron employees whose pension plans were tied to the shares Mr Lays decision to withdraw will undoubtedly raise more questions of his strong political connections to the White House Mr Lay an old friend of US President George W Bush was also a major donor to Mr Bushs presidential campaign contributing in soft money to the Republican Party Mr Bush has been dogged by questions about the six meetings VicePresident Dick Cheney or his staff held with Enron executives last year Mr Cheney has refused to release records on those meetings saying they involved matters of energy policy prompting an unprecedented lawsuit from the congressional General Accounting Office The personal drama of the top level executives involved has created a subplot of its own Clifford Baxter a yearold former Enron vicechairman committed suicide about two weeks ago And Mr Lay enlisted his wife Linda last week in a bid to garner public support appearing on a series of teary interviews on NBCs Today Show where she said her husband had lost everything even though he received more than USmillion since from salary bonuses and sales of Enron stock The Enron report released Saturday singled out other top Enron employees who were involved with affiliated partnerships that enriched themselves by tens of millions of dollars they should have never received The report said former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow pocketed at least USmillion and former general manager Michael Kopper took at least USmillion The two worked together in forming several partnerships that bought assets off of Enron But the existence of these transactions was merely one aspect of a deeper and more serious problem the report said Many of the most significant transactions apparently were designed to accomplish favorable
