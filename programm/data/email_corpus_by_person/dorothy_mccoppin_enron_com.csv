Stanley Wilson Rob SubjectRE Two proceeding changes Christi I dont think it changes the requirement to file by October e ither and we are proceeding under the same schedule Several rehearing re quests were submitted including one for ENAEES However note the follow ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENAEES western commercia l and government affairs folks I noted you deleted your message without re ading it I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O MB ruling a good sign As detailed in the attached FERC notice the Office of Management and Budge t OMB has approved FERCs Information Collection Request for Reporting o f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market through the sixmonth emergen cy period that will expire on Emergency reporting requirements a re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations Howev er it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re porting requirements could be extended OMB has advised FERC that if it decides to request renewal of the Informat ion Collection Request after that date it must address certain issues as p art of its supporting statement more specifically include an explicit di scussion As you may remember in addition to requesting rehearing of th e FERC order ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERCs estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co llection of information We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements much less keep o ur records in that manner We manage our business on an aggregated basis and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale We stated that we might even have to hire fulltime staff to dedicate to the task The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo rting requirements past FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through to coincide w ith the end date of its mitigation plan OMB questioned the practical uti lity of requiring disaggregated data when commenters reported that they d id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d ata manipulation in order to respond and the resulting disaggregation woul d likely be artificial OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti mates after consulting with respondents and it must provide a list of th e names affiliates and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision At the least it sen ds a signal
