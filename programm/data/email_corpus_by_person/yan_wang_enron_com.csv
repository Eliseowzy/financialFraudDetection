<26113223.1075845339404.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yan.wang@enron.com,2001-05-31 08:17:00,Log and others Cc Guys I am really glad that the report generations were working fine during the period when I was away thanks to the efforts of Kim Lindon and Angela But I am so sad that you dont have to have me around anymore for your reports Hereby Id like to give you an update on a few issues we fixedfixing a Code has been added to show the Storage balance in the historical report instead of average b Because OLAP cube interprets Null as value we saw monthly average to be but actually should be Null weve added code to detect Null value so that NA will be shown for monthly average rather than c Some pipeline eg PGE broadcast forward future flow so in the end of the month the latest month in Time dimension of the cube does not indicate the correct one For instance today is May the latest month in Time dimension is already June which cause problems in historical report It has been fixed e Central historical reports have been made fit to one page and extra sheets on the interactive ones have been removed Matt In order for the above items to take effect please verify with the executable Kim give you and let us know so that we can use it to replace the one currently used for report generation Another thing I talked with Matt was the Maximum Capacity column I understand that youd like to remove that column for reports which do not report this value however it involves big structure change to take one column away I am wondering if we can put NA or use some other wording such as not reported instead to save coding time and structure change I need your feedback on this One last item is that I checked the log for both daily and historical report and noticed that there are still quite some points their report setting are not quite right Please take a look at the attached if it is a report you are responsible make sure the settings are right so we dont see error in the log Thanks Ill try to write short email next time Yan x

<19397077.1075845334197.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yan.wang@enron.com,2001-05-01 05:18:33,RE issue with report generation issue Cc All Just as a follow up to the mail I sent yesterday what I found out this morning is that all reports generation based on the st cub processing are successful after I moved the cube processing time back to AM This probably tells us that we need to leave enough time between the last scraping and the cube processing although what caused the blowup yesterday is still mysterious The lesson is when it is working do not make changes or it may break There are still a few format issues I need to fix Yan Original Message From Wang Yan Sent Monday April AM To Gaskill Chris Reitmeyer Jay Smith Matt Piazze Tara Tonks Colin Hyde Chris Dronet David Zhang Eddie Cc Alexander Kim D Hylton Angela Chiu Lindon Subject issue with report generation issue All As you all noticed that on many of our morning reports today NA were put there as todays data that means at the time those reports were generated todays data were not in the cube so the report engine put NA there However by looking at the RetrievedDTM field in the MeterUsageStat table in our database it showed that the scrapings were successful for all west pipelines as of PM last night When I checked the history log of cube processing the cube were processed successfully both times at PM last night and AM this morning respectively We process cube twice in the morning the purpose of second processing is to grab those manual entry data Reports generated after second processing CIGWIC SoCal and Rockies Production were all successful Only those reports generated after first processing are problematic So only two possibilities I can thick of can explain this Although processing log showed success it did not actually grab newly entered data to the cube with the first procssing Those data were not in the database table at the time of first processing I believe the true reason has to be one of the above But my investigation so far can not give me any clue as what could have caused one of above Because if was true well need ask Microsoft on the consistency of cube processing cube processing has never failed us before If was true it could not explain why in the RetrievedDTM column of MeterUsageStat table showed us that before the first processing the data were already in the database My intention to move the first processing time from AM to PM was to have more time between the two processing to take care of the growing number of reports we are generating I thought hour difference between the last scraping and cube processing should be enough That was the only change I made last week and we had not experience such a problem before this change So without knowing the true cause of the problem what I am going to do is to move the st cube processing time back to AM to see if it corrects the problem Ill try to be here early tomorrow morning to make sure all the reports run fine I welcome your suggestions and comments on the possible cause of the problem to suggestions on how to prevent this from happening again Thanks Yan x
<23826337.1075845334339.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,yan.wang@enron.com,2001-05-01 12:06:44,Monthly Avg and MDT Avg on st day of each month Cc Guys Some of you have noticed that on many of todays reports we are able to see flow value for a meter for but the MDT column showed na on the daily report na is also shown on the historical report for the average of May It is very easy to get confused at least I was in the beginnieng even though I wrote the program myself when you see things like this you may ask why isnt the average the value shown for today since there is only one days data The answer is that they are from different cycles Coding used the business logic that grab the flow value from the latest successful cycle while always use the last cycle when deal with average At the time of report generation if the last cycle is not available this will happen Fortunately this only happens on the first day of each month Please explain this to those who may raise this question when they see this discrepancy Yan
