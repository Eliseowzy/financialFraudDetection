Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM He wanted me to come right up and talk to them about EnronOnline and how to get their products on the web So of course we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour on what they want to do I knew we were going to start trading steel but had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online So I sent Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for thoughtsconcerns going forward This will not require any technical changes enhancements etc and should be very easy for us to handle I received the responses below from Dave and sent him my response I am not sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him but there is no reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns I am on vacation beginning this afternoon and will return on Monday I am going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave thanks Sheri Forwarded by Sheri ThomasHOUECT on AM From Sheri Thomas AM To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel I would appreciate being privy to some of this information in the future so that I do not get blindsided going forward Greg called me directly yesterday and wanted to discuss this immediately EIM will be offering the products and we did discuss the metals effort and coordination of such fyi Amita gave Greg my name as the contact Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg Jason and Sean about two weeks ago to set up a meeting I informed her at that time that we were in the throes of Phase launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we should meet after Phase I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel Enron Network Partners and Enron Metals and the relationship between them As you know Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on EnronOnline Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and Copper there is obviously a degree of overlap It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals activities and that all the usual bases are covered Marketing launch processes commercial review of contracts products and structure regulatory compliance application training etc I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the above their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to create an Enron Steel vertical Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of contact Thanks Dave To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel that is why I sent this to you any thoughts thanks Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Sheri Who are you working with within EnronOnline to ensure this fits our priority list Dave To Andy nron cc David nron Jennifer deBoisblanc CT Subject Steel Andy We Jennifer Rob and I just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading group here in the US Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were also present They want to start trading asap we gathered all the initial information we would need to get the product type set up Here are the facts Financial products only but he wants to offer physical products in the near future The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move the product do not exist the same challenge the paper guys have We are not trading this product OTC yet The GTCs and long descriptions are in draft format Harry Collins Legal is working on Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close on this The key customer list consists of approx customers additional we requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started I will send a note to Debbie Brackett tonight As you can imagine most of these are customers we are not currently doing business with and the steel industry has not been the most profitable the last few years so I am not sure how many of these will even get approved Back office systems they have not decided what they are going to use yet Sitara TAGG or some other system really irrelevant for you but we will bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant this They have not determined which indexpublication they will use most likely something called Metal Bulletin The first two product

Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM He wanted me to come right up and talk to them about EnronOnline and how to get their products on the web So of course we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour on what they want to do I knew we were going to start trading steel but had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online So I sent Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for thoughtsconcerns going forward This will not require any technical changes enhancements etc and should be very easy for us to handle I received the responses below from Dave and sent him my response I am not sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him but there is no reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns I am on vacation beginning this afternoon and will return on Monday I am going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave thanks Sheri Forwarded by Sheri ThomasHOUECT on AM From Sheri Thomas AM To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel I would appreciate being privy to some of this information in the future so that I do not get blindsided going forward Greg called me directly yesterday and wanted to discuss this immediately EIM will be offering the products and we did discuss the metals effort and coordination of such fyi Amita gave Greg my name as the contact Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg Jason and Sean about two weeks ago to set up a meeting I informed her at that time that we were in the throes of Phase launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we should meet after Phase I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel Enron Network Partners and Enron Metals and the relationship between them As you know Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on EnronOnline Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and Copper there is obviously a degree of overlap It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals activities and that all the usual bases are covered Marketing launch processes commercial review of contracts products and structure regulatory compliance application training etc I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the above their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to create an Enron Steel vertical Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of contact Thanks Dave To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel that is why I sent this to you any thoughts thanks Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Sheri Who are you working with within EnronOnline to ensure this fits our priority list Dave To Andy nron cc David nron Jennifer deBoisblanc CT Subject Steel Andy We Jennifer Rob and I just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading group here in the US Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were also present They want to start trading asap we gathered all the initial information we would need to get the product type set up Here are the facts Financial products only but he wants to offer physical products in the near future The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move the product do not exist the same challenge the paper guys have We are not trading this product OTC yet The GTCs and long descriptions are in draft format Harry Collins Legal is working on Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close on this The key customer list consists of approx customers additional we requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started I will send a note to Debbie Brackett tonight As you can imagine most of these are customers we are not currently doing business with and the steel industry has not been the most profitable the last few years so I am not sure how many of these will even get approved Back office systems they have not decided what they are going to use yet Sitara TAGG or some other system really irrelevant for you but we will bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant this They have not determined which indexpublication they will use most likely something called Metal Bulletin The first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled All products will be offered in USD We need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA I am fairly sure it will be ENA but we are discussing with legal Greg was not sure This may not be news to you but just in case I wanted to make sure you were in the loop Please let me know if you have any thoughtsconcerns Thanks Sheri

Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM He wanted me to come right up and talk to them about EnronOnline and how to get their products on the web So of course we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour on what they want to do I knew we were going to start trading steel but had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online So I sent Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for thoughtsconcerns going forward This will not require any technical changes enhancements etc and should be very easy for us to handle I received the responses below from Dave and sent him my response I am not sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him but there is no reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns I am on vacation beginning this afternoon and will return on Monday I am going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave thanks Sheri Forwarded by Sheri ThomasHOUECT on AM From Sheri Thomas AM To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel I would appreciate being privy to some of this information in the future so that I do not get blindsided going forward Greg called me directly yesterday and wanted to discuss this immediately EIM will be offering the products and we did discuss the metals effort and coordination of such fyi Amita gave Greg my name as the contact Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg Jason and Sean about two weeks ago to set up a meeting I informed her at that time that we were in the throes of Phase launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we should meet after Phase I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel Enron Network Partners and Enron Metals and the relationship between them As you know Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on EnronOnline Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and Copper there is obviously a degree of overlap It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals activities and that all the usual bases are covered Marketing launch processes commercial review of contracts products and structure regulatory compliance application training etc I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the above their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to create an Enron Steel vertical Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of contact Thanks Dave To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel that is why I sent this to you any thoughts thanks Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Sheri Who are you working with within EnronOnline to ensure this fits our priority list Dave To Andy nron cc David nron Jennifer deBoisblanc CT Subject Steel Andy We Jennifer Rob and I just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading group here in the US Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were also present They want to start trading asap we gathered all the initial information we would need to get the product type set up Here are the facts Financial products only but he wants to offer physical products in the near future The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move the product do not exist the same challenge the paper guys have We are not trading this product OTC yet The GTCs and long descriptions are in draft format Harry Collins Legal is working on Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close on this The key customer list consists of approx customers additional we requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started I will send a note to Debbie Brackett tonight As you can imagine most of these are customers we are not currently doing business with and the steel industry has not been the most profitable the last few years so I am not sure how many of these will even get approved Back office systems they have not decided what they are going to use yet Sitara TAGG or some other system really irrelevant for you but we will bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant this They have not determined which indexpublication they will use most likely something called Metal Bulletin The first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled All products will be offered in USD We need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA I am fairly sure it will be ENA but we are discussing with legal Greg was not sure This may not be news to you but just in case I wanted to make sure you were in the loop Please let me know if you have any thoughtsconcerns Thanks Sheri

Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM He wanted me to come right up and talk to them about EnronOnline and how to get their products on the web So of course we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour on what they want to do I knew we were going to start trading steel but had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online So I sent Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for thoughtsconcerns going forward This will not require any technical changes enhancements etc and should be very easy for us to handle I received the responses below from Dave and sent him my response I am not sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him but there is no reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns I am on vacation beginning this afternoon and will return on Monday I am going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave thanks Sheri Forwarded by Sheri ThomasHOUECT on AM From Sheri Thomas AM To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel I would appreciate being privy to some of this information in the future so that I do not get blindsided going forward Greg called me directly yesterday and wanted to discuss this immediately EIM will be offering the products and we did discuss the metals effort and coordination of such fyi Amita gave Greg my name as the contact Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Jayshree approached me on behalf of Greg Jason and Sean about two weeks ago to set up a meeting I informed her at that time that we were in the throes of Phase launch and that we were focussed on their LME products and that we should meet after Phase I have also exchanged voice mails on same with Sean and have had recent discussions with Bruce Garner on Steel Enron Network Partners and Enron Metals and the relationship between them As you know Amita has worldwide responsibility for metals on EnronOnline Although the Steel group is under separate ownership from Aluminum and Copper there is obviously a degree of overlap It is important that the Steel launch is coordinated with our other metals activities and that all the usual bases are covered Marketing launch processes commercial review of contracts products and structure regulatory compliance application training etc I am planning to meet Greg and Sean next week in Houston to discuss the above their launch timetable and coordination with an expressed desire to create an Enron Steel vertical Please do not do anything further until I have had an opportunity to meet Greg and Sean and have assigned someone to take responsibility for coordinating all of the launch elements and to act as a central point of contact Thanks Dave To David NRON cc Subject Re Steel that is why I sent this to you any thoughts thanks Sheri David NRON AM To Sheri CT cc Subject Re Steel Sheri Who are you working with within EnronOnline to ensure this fits our priority list Dave To Andy nron cc David nron Jennifer deBoisblanc CT Subject Steel Andy We Jennifer Rob and I just met with Greg Hermans who will be heading up the steel trading group here in the US Jason Seigal and Sean Keenan were also present They want to start trading asap we gathered all the initial information we would need to get the product type set up Here are the facts Financial products only but he wants to offer physical products in the near future The issue is that back office logistics systems to physically move the product do not exist the same challenge the paper guys have We are not trading this product OTC yet The GTCs and long descriptions are in draft format Harry Collins Legal is working on Rob Cass has already talked to Harry and I think we are close on this The key customer list consists of approx customers additional we requested this by Friday so that Credit can get started I will send a note to Debbie Brackett tonight As you can imagine most of these are customers we are not currently doing business with and the steel industry has not been the most profitable the last few years so I am not sure how many of these will even get approved Back office systems they have not decided what they are going to use yet Sitara TAGG or some other system really irrelevant for you but we will bridge to whatever system they choose if the number of transactions warrant this They have not determined which indexpublication they will use most likely something called Metal Bulletin The first two product types will be Hot Rolled and Cold Rolled All products will be offered in USD We need to determine if the products will be offered by EIM or ENA I am fairly sure it will be ENA but we are discussing with legal Greg was not sure This may not be news to you but just in case I wanted to make sure you were in the loop Please let me know if you have any thoughtsconcerns Thanks Sheri
