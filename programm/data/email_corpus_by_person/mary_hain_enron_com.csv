Settanni AM To Mary CT cc Subject Seasonal Rates Mary Pursuant to your request I reviewed FERC orders discussing seasonal rates Based on what I found Dan was right it does not seem that seasonal rates are prohibited If proposed however seasonal rates must be cost justified I did not come across any particular discussion of what kinds of proof are necessary you had asked about the time period for actual sales and elasticity of demand I have included a few paragraphs below from FERC orders that discuss seasonal rates which may be useful to you Please let us know if you would like us to look into this any further Andrea Related to ALJDEC FERC Union Electric Company Docket No ER June It might be noted that UE could have established a seasonaltimeofday rate with cost justification or by explaining its departure from costbased rates In Commonwealth Edison the Presiding Judge rejected a higher seasonal demand charge for the summer because it was not cost justified He also held however that where the rate design is not intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates CFR o biii FERC at p UE made a valiant effort to comply It attempted to relate the offpeak costs to onpeak by its percent discount argument and reference to its Exhibits UE and UE These exhibits amply justify the onpeak costs but offer no cost support for the offpeak discount This discount is chosen as a matter of judgment A similar proposal was rejected by the Presiding Judge in Commonwealth Edison Id Although the argument of a free ride deserves consideration based on the record we have here and in the absence of a detailed cost justification UEs offpeak demand charge is rejected REVERSED see next paragraph COMMOPINIONORDER FERC Union Electric Company Docket No ER July Unions proposal to assess a capacity charge for offpeak service under specified circumstances when a customers offpeak demand exceeds twice its highest measured peak demand not only reflects the fact that customers use the companys production and transmission plant offpeak and capacityrelated costs are incurred during those times but also recognizes the equity consideration created by the existence of the peak shaving option to certain customers Upon consideration of the evidence presented and the merits of the arguments raised by the parties we reverse the judges ruling and allow the offpeak billing demand provision Although we are approving Unions use of an offpeak billing demand provision the Commission nevertheless believes that a strong incentive continues to exist for customers to peak shave and thus realize cost savings Furthermore although we adopt Unions approach as reasonable within the context of this case this is not to say that only such an approach is appropriate or that this approach is preferred COMMOPINIONORDER FERC Florida Power Corporation Docket No ER Apr urging rejection of FPCs proposed rate increase On February the Public Service Commission of the State of Florida filed a letter noting the absence of proposals relating to peak load pricing timeofday and seasonal rate differentials in FPCs submittal The Public Service Commission urged our review of the issues of timeofday and seasonal pricing in this proceeding We note that the questions of timeofday and seasonal pricing are proper subjects for the hearing ordered below if any party chooses to pursue them including the Florida Commission should it petition to intervene late in this proceeding COMMOPINIONORDER FERC Commonwealth Edison Company Docket No ER Mar Our review of Commonwealths filing indicates that the proposed rates have not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful Therefore we shall accept the proposed rates for filing and suspend those rates for five months to become effective subject to refund on September We note with interest that the proposed rates are designed on a timeofday and seasonal basis The Commission has encouraged the use of innovative rate design as a way of more closely matching rates to costs and thereby minimizing misallocation of resources as well as reducing waste inequity and discrimination We therefore direct the Presiding Administrative Law Judge to insure that the parties fully address the issues raised related to the cost support for the timeofday and seasonal rate design FEDREGS FERCSR FPA Regulations CFR Sec Filing of changes in rate schedules shall fully support all such data and shall explain the rationale and the specific application proposed vii Based upon information reported in Statements BB and BC the utility shall list selected months that are normally the months of greatest significance in determining the need of the utility for power supply capability throughout the year All twelve months may be selected if appropriate In its selection the utility shall take into account any effects of local weather seasons and particularly the extent to which peak demands may tend to be similar in magnitude in two or more months of a weather season The utility shall explain the reasons for the selections and describe the significance for the selections of seasonal variations in the weather REGPREAMBLE FERCSR Inquiry Concerning the Commissions Merger Policy Under the Federal Power Act Policy Statement Order No December Docket No RM CFR FR PART OF Identify the relevant products The first step is to identify one or more products sold by the merging entities Products may be grouped together when they are good substitutes for each other from the buyers perspective If two products are not good substitutes an entity with market power can raise the price of one product and buyers would have a limited ability to shift their purchases to other products In the past the Commission has analyzed three products nonfirm energy shortterm capacity firm energy and longterm capacity These remain reasonable products under the prevailing institutional arrangements and applicants should recognize such products in their analysis Other product definitions may also be acceptable For example the lack of onsite buyer storage creates products differentiated by time Thus peak and offpeak energy seasonal and daily may be distinct products ALJDEC FERC Commonwealth Edison Company Docket Nos ER and ER June PART OF It is Commission policy that rate design reflect cost incurrence Idaho Power Co Opinion No issued May mimeo at Minnesota Power and Light Co Opinion No issued April mimeo at In both cases the Commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence id In its order setting this proceeding for hearing the Commission took note of Edisons proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design Commission Order issued March mimeo at On October the parties were directed by the Presiding Judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential The requirement that Edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential as discussed supra is also set forth in the Commissions filing requirements for rate schedules if the rate design is intended to reflect costs the applicant must show how it reflects costs if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates CFR obiii Statement P Edisons seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak Edison reasons that since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and therefore Edisons cost of adding capacity would be reduced Tr Accordingly Edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand under the Commissions filing requirements in CFR o biii Statement P Further even PURPA Section d relied upon by Edison states that rates shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility Emphasis added Further support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the Commission itself In its order of March setting this cause for hearing mimeo at the Commission in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs In this regard the Commission cited its Order No supra at which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles for jurisdictional wholesale sales Under the circumstances in this case where the sale of economy energy is related to Edisons costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs This provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs Accordingly Winnetkas position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted AFFIRMED and REVERSED see next paragraph COMMOPINIONORDER FERC Commonwealth Edison Company Docket Nos ER and ER May Turning to Commonwealths exceptions we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential Even if we accept the companys interpretation of PURPA it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months Without at least some showing of a cost difference it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the companys proposal We therefore uphold the judge on this point We reverse the judges adoption of a price set at of the utilitys incremental costs however and approve the typeB splitsavings method proposed by Commonwealth Under this method economy transactions are arranged for a hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement If the utilitys incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome the utility may terminate supply We find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified Cost determinations need not be made as frequently Related to PMAs REGPREAMBLE FERCSR Procedures for Public Participation in Power and Transmission Rate Adjustments and Extensions December CFR FR Historically many PURPAtype standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of Federal hydroelectric power PMAs analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates Declining block rates for energy were once used by the PMAs but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules Many of the PMAs for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules such as scheduling limitations loadshaping capacity and energy overrun charges etc BPA has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago Southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since These examples demonstrate the willingness of the PMAs to implement PURPAtype standards where applicable Many of these PURPAtype standards when applied appropriately in the design of PMA rates can serve to implement the purposes of PURPA by encouraging conservation of energy efficient use of resources and facilities and equitable rates The public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts The PMAs will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a systembysystem basis to serve the PURPA objectives The Assistant Secretary for Resource Applications working with the Administrators of the power

energy is related to Edisons costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs This provides a more close

call IMAGE IssueAlert for March PGOCorp Receives Billion To Partially Pay Off Debts by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis PGOCorp parent of nearly bankrupt utility PGOCo announced that it has closed a billion loan agreement that will allow it to pay various debts including its defaulted fourth quarter dividend to shareholders The loans provided by GE Capital Structured Finance Group and Lehman Brothers will be secured by the companys equity interest in PGONational Energy Group LLC Analysis Although this may seem like a positive step for the troubled utility PGOCos partial payment pales in comparison to its outstanding debt Making matters even worse for the company is a new wave of lawsuits seeking restitution in the amount of billion The loans which PGOCorp was able to secure due to the strong performance of its National Energy Group subsidiary have enabled the corporation to pay its outstanding debt obligations on which it has defaulted or would default in the near future The obligations that have been paid include million in payments to commercial paper holders million in borrowings under a revolving credit agreement and million owned to PGOCorporation common shareholders for the defaulted Q dividend The loan which has a term of two years includes an option that depending on certain factors would give the lenders between and percent of the shares in National Energy Group In addition the loan agreement prohibits PGOfrom declaring or paying future common stock dividends until the loans are repaid In an effort to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy on Jan PGOCorp halted payment of its fourth quarter dividend which had been declared on Oct and was due to be payable on Jan Soon after that the company announced that it would not be able to make certain payments on commercial paper obligations Citing that the risk of bankruptcy played a factor in assuming the loan PGOCorp CEO and President Robert Glynn said that the financing would be repaid with PGOCorp shareholder dollars only In other words Glynn reassured customers of the utility that rates would not be increased as a mechanism to repay this loan However PGOcontinues its negotiations with Calif Gov Gray Davis to increase rates for at least a substantial part of losses already accrued due to skyrocketing prices in the wholesale market Reportedly as of Dec PGOhad racked up more than billion in undercollected costs In its K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission PGOCorp acknowledged that it would be damaged further if the California Public Utilities Commission adopts current power payment proposals without an electric rate increase Meanwhile a pending deal between PGOand Gov Davis is expected to include the sale of the utilitys transmission assets to the state of California much like PGEs counterpart Southern California Edison SCE has already done The bottom line of the loans is that PGOis removed from being in default on its credit agreements according to Greg Pruett vice president of corporate communications in an interview with CBSMarketWatchcom Pruett also said that the loans amounted to one less item of significance that the holding company has to attend to ensure it doesnt find itself in a situation where it could have creditors seeking to force it into bankruptcy However as noted just as PGOCorp received this loan the parent company and the utility announced that they have been hit with two lawsuits seeking a total of nearly billion in restitution PGOCorp and PGOCo on the basis of the newly secured loan say that they can only make partial payments of billion Both lawsuits were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Feb According to CBSMarketWatchcom one lawsuit alleges that PGOCorp violated its fiduciary duties by repurchasing common share of its PGOCo unit at a price of billion The second lawsuit claims that PGOCorp collected nearly billion from PGOCo under a taxsharing arrangement but paid only billion to all governments under the arrangement The plaintiff in both suits is identified only as Richard D Wilson who seeks to enjoin any more such buybacks unless good cause is shown and also seeks restitution of billion with interest from PGOCorp The parent company and utility have discounted the validity of the lawsuits although they said they were unable to predict any outcome or how it might their financial conditions In its most recent filing with the SEC PGOalso disclosed that the utility unit owes billion to the California Independent System Operator for December energy purchases and another million to a group of unidentified power generators for January deliveries At that time which was only a few days before PGOCorp secured the loans the company said it could only make partial payments of these debts on a pro rata basis As a result PGOCorp said it could only pay the California ISO about million and make payments of million to the power suppliers It appears that PGOCorp has not used any of the funds secured in its loans to make additional payments to the California ISO or power suppliers As noted PGEs subsidiary National Energy Group played a prominent role in its parents loans The loans will be secured by the companys equity interest in National Energy Group and the lenders could potentially gain a or percent interest in the subsidiary National Energy Group is PGOCorps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New England PGOCorp has previously claimed that its goal is for National Energy Group to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by While the regulated PGOCo continues to struggle in debt National Energy Group has been quite successful In fact much of PGOCorps earnings over came directly from National Energy Group which gained a percent profit increase in Q and an percent profit increase in Q Clearly PGOCorp has benefited greatly from National Energy Groups ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside in deregulated markets outside of California Thus it is no wonder that although PGOCorp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated Just last month PGOCorp gained approval to implement a shrewd restructuring of its business units that protects National Energy Group and other highprofit subsidiaries from any impact that the bankruptcy of the regulated utility or parent company might cause In other words if PGOCorp and PGOCo ultimately declare bankruptcy subsidiaries such as National Energy Group would not bear any foreseeable impact protecting some of PGEs most profitable business units from financial insolvency Ironically however through this loan there is now a tie between the unregulated business of National Energy Group and the regulated PGOCo although the ramifications of this connection are not completely clear at this time Moreover while the loan that PGOhas secured certainly helps it by no means brings an end to the utilitys financial problems Through the loan PGOhas been enabled to pay outstanding debt obligations on which it has already defaulted or may default on in the near future However the payments made in the amount of billion only reflect a small percentage of PGEs reported billion of total debt Thus bankruptcy is still a strong possibility for the company unless some other new major development occurs Most likely this development will be the sale of its transmission system to the state PGOmay have to lower its expectations of what it believes its system to be worth reportedly billion However just as SCE has now been apparently protected from bankruptcy filing due to the sale of its own transmission system PGOmay also find that an asset sale is its only recourse at this juncture An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

<11005541.1075860474705.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2001-02-15 08:46:00,My comments on Sierra Pacifics Draft interconnection agreement Cc are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement In the sixth whereas page and Sections and the contract states that either the generating company or the generating companys customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed Specifically a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability or privity of contract to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific For example the generator may sell the power to Dynegy who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service The eighth Whereas page and Sections E E E E E E E E E and E state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System RMS Agreement I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the good utility practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement Enron has signed the RMS Agreement I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and in order for RTO West to form BPA must agree to join Enron is very interested in RTO West forming If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard Section Contrary to our requests this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective This is not the way the OATT operates Rather if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC as we have done and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierras open access tariff Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies The FERC has determined that filings under Section and therefor of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely undermine the purpose of Order No Section After by both parties add however if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT Section Three years advance written notice is too long A reasonable notice period would be Section and EPMI opposes the definitions of Applicable Laws Applicable Permits and Applicable Reliability Criteria because when combined with their use throughout the contract in Sections E E E E E and E they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action Section Section i of the definition of Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for the most reliable supply Change the most reliable to a reliable Section Is inconsistent with Sierras OATT It should be written using the same words as the OATT Section The reference to Section should be corrected to Section Definition of System Integrity is too broad When combined with Section it would require our generator to not have an adverse impact on maximizing the health welfare safety of personnel and the general public While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not Section The proposed Use of System Integrity here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the Good Utility Practice standard Section Shouldnt the word unplanned be added before the word Outages Section EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others Section The second sentence exposes EPMI to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion Editorial note the third to last sentence is missing a period Section See comments under Section Section EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract Accordingly the words or ordered by FERC should be deleted EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra with FERCs approval to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierras facilities Section Should the words generating companys applicable FERCapproved tariff be changed to Applicable Law Section EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than percent Under FERCs precedent EPMI is only required to pay actual cost Section Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice The words plus Interest should be added after the words difference in the fourth sentence Section This section says essentially the same thing as Section and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons Section Add period at end of sentence Section Delete period after the word and in last sentence Section Add period after Interconnection Facilities Section EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties Section Delete the word and on the seventh line Section See comments under Sections Section Delete pennits from last line on page and insert permits Section After remediation or abatement activity insert pay all fines penalties or compensations as required by law Section There should be a reciprocal provision for generators Section EPMI opposes regulatory Force Majeure Section This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI Section Add the letter y after and ma on the second line Section Third to last line change ahs to has Section Needs to be edited Section This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTOs requirements Section By law System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection Section This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERCs pro forma OATT under Order No Section of the contract retains EPMIs rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates terms or conditions etc of the interconnection agreement Exhibit D D EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties D The phrase Except under Applicable Law should be added before the first sentence D EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierras discretion Accordingly EPMI opposes this entire provision If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs EPMI would agree to provide level of VArs at rate EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierras discretion subject to this rate in the case of an Emergency Otherwise EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power instead of VArs to the market at a marketbased rate and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierras discretion without being assured the cost of cover Accordingly the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory D EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service D Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of realtime load following service Accordingly this provision should be deleted D EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted Sierra should get ancillary services from the market E Change minimized to minimize E Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator may affect System Integrity E EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to approve Planned Outage Schedules E Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term System Integrity here as too high as standard E The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages E Add the word the on line after at E EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E E Because VArs could be sold as real power System Control should not be allowed to establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules Rather Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires See also E establishing power factors E EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra We need to negotiate compensation E Giving Sierra sole discretion to determine unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System is too broad E Repots should be reports

cc Subject Governor Davis Announces Bill Package to Increase Renewable Energ y Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

credence Forwarded by Mary HainHOUECT on PM Alan Comnes PM To Tim CT Susan J NRON Paul CT Jeff nron cc Subject Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests

Alan Comnes Earlier Email Here is another hefty ISO filing that came in this week Please let Sue o r I know if you believe we should interveneprotest Alan Comnes Summary of ISO Amendment Filed December Effective Date expedited treatment requested Protests Due January need to confirm this Filing in a Nutshell The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t o clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi on Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No According to the ISO Amendment has been accepted for filing suspended and set for hearing Settlement negotiations are ongoing Is Enron a par ty to these settlements In addition the ISO provides new transmission Acce ss Charge TAC rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci ty of Vernon joining the ISO effective January and the amount of Firm Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO Tariff Specific Proposed Changes Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the Wheeling Access Charge the proper calculation is to u se transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th e ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method New HV TAC Rates Using Year of the ISOs Proposed Transmission Methodo logy The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating TO Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO they are known as license plate rates Under Amendment No this met hodology continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO Once that occurs the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen ts of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area The filing claims to implement an alreadyapproved transition formula where in new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst em average embedded costs The goal is that after years there will be only high voltage access charge The following table shows that under the curren t method which would be a split of licenseplatesystemaverage charge s PGE and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately million and Vernon would be subsidized approximately million Calculation of the net benefitsburdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact PGE and SCE have a Million cap annually and SDGE has a Million cap annually Vernon is held harmless I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota l capAdjusted Net Benefit Burden PGE SCE SDGE Vernon Total Note a positive number means the TAC is going up A negative number me ans the TAC is going down or will be lower than would be the case under license plate ratemaking Vernons Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs Veron by joining the ISO effective agrees to convert existing transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount The propos ed FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing These FTRs will expire when the underlying contract right

Trade Resources Corp From Meringolo Peter PM To Fergus Gary S Stephen C Hall Email cc Subject Draft letter to the CPUC Please let either Gary or me know your thoughts and comments regarding the below draft letter to the CPUC Thanks Peter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may

summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No to close the bypass loophole She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldnt figure out a way to recover these costs Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities To Mary CT cc Subject Re Stranded costs I needed a response Thanks Mary Hain PM To Christi L CT cc Robert NRON James D nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Christopher F CT Chris H CT Paul CT Subject Re Stranded costs I think I know what youre talking about I know you werent asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No and A without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases In Order No FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee Par at So in general customers cant avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery Id at There appears to be a loophole that if applicable would allow bypass For contracts that dont contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision However in that case the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve Id at note Accordingly the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service If the loophole does not apply because the contract does not have such a notice provision the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable wherein the customer would have the burden of proof But if they do the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customers Section proceeding Order No A Par at Likewise if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs the customer must make any Section claim in that case Id The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs However FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required Order No at I dont know anything about what the individual states have done I hope this helps To Robert NRON cc James D nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Mary CT Subject Re Stranded costs Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several years ago However the commercial people would like to market this possibly to others not simply wholesale customers What happens at the retail level on stranded costs Thanks Robert NRON PM To Christi L CT cc James D CT Harry CT Joe CT Sarah CT Donna CT Mary CT Subject Re Stranded costs This is a FERC issue because its would involve wholesale stranded costs Joe and Sarah will correct me if Im wrong but I believe Order provides that if the muni or other wholesale customer is able to bypass the transmission facilities of its former provider and I believe there is dispute over what constitutes bypass then they may be able to avoid stranded cost liability From Christi L Nicolay ECT PM To James D nron Robert nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Mary CT cc Subject Stranded costs I had a question from the commercial people about whether a muni could build a new interconnection to another utility to avoid stranded costs of the incumbent utility While the particular question happened to be in Indiana and I sent them to Janine they were stating that this stranded cost avoidance is something that they may want to tout as a benefit of building new interconnections I think that we would look initially to the state restructuring law to see if this is specifically addressed However I recall someone saying that there may be a constitutional question as to whether an incumbent utility can charge stranded costs to someone who leaves its system but I dont think this has been addressed at the appellate or Supreme Court level I want to make sure that our commercial people know what is the status of the law in this area I would appreciate any help on this Thanks

<15498296.1075860373671.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2001-02-15 08:46:00,My comments on Sierra Pacifics Draft interconnection agreement Cc are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement In the sixth whereas page and Sections and the contract states that either the generating company or the generating companys customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed Specifically a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability or privity of contract to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific For example the generator may sell the power to Dynegy who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service The eighth Whereas page and Sections E E E E E E E E E and E state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System RMS Agreement I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the good utility practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement Enron has signed the RMS Agreement I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and in order for RTO West to form BPA must agree to join Enron is very interested in RTO West forming If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard Section Contrary to our requests this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective This is not the way the OATT operates Rather if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC as we have done and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierras open access tariff Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies The FERC has determined that filings under Section and therefor of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely undermine the purpose of Order No Section After by both parties add however if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT Section Three years advance written notice is too long A reasonable notice period would be Section and EPMI opposes the definitions of Applicable Laws Applicable Permits and Applicable Reliability Criteria because when combined with their use throughout the contract in Sections E E E E E and E they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action Section Section i of the definition of Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for the most reliable supply Change the most reliable to a reliable Section Is inconsistent with Sierras OATT It should be written using the same words as the OATT Section The reference to Section should be corrected to Section Definition of System Integrity is too broad When combined with Section it would require our generator to not have an adverse impact on maximizing the health welfare safety of personnel and the general public While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not Section The proposed Use of System Integrity here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the Good Utility Practice standard Section Shouldnt the word unplanned be added before the word Outages Section EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others Section The second sentence exposes EPMI to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion Editorial note the third to last sentence is missing a period Section See comments under Section Section EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract Accordingly the words or ordered by FERC should be deleted EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra with FERCs approval to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierras facilities Section Should the words generating companys applicable FERCapproved tariff be changed to Applicable Law Section EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than percent Under FERCs precedent EPMI is only required to pay actual cost Section Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice The words plus Interest should be added after the words difference in the fourth sentence Section This section says essentially the same thing as Section and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons Section Add period at end of sentence Section Delete period after the word and in last sentence Section Add period after Interconnection Facilities Section EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties Section Delete the word and on the seventh line Section See comments under Sections Section Delete pennits from last line on page and insert permits Section After remediation or abatement activity insert pay all fines penalties or compensations as required by law Section There should be a reciprocal provision for generators Section EPMI opposes regulatory Force Majeure Section This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI Section Add the letter y after and ma on the second line Section Third to last line change ahs to has Section Needs to be edited Section This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTOs requirements Section By law System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection Section This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERCs pro forma OATT under Order No Section of the contract retains EPMIs rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates terms or conditions etc of the interconnection agreement Exhibit D D EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties D The phrase Except under Applicable Law should be added before the first sentence D EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierras discretion Accordingly EPMI opposes this entire provision If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs EPMI would agree to provide level of VArs at rate EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierras discretion subject to this rate in the case of an Emergency Otherwise EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power instead of VArs to the market at a marketbased rate and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierras discretion without being assured the cost of cover Accordingly the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory D EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service D Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of realtime load following service Accordingly this provision should be deleted D EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted Sierra should get ancillary services from the market E Change minimized to minimize E Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator may affect System Integrity E EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to approve Planned Outage Schedules E Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term System Integrity here as too high as standard E The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages E Add the word the on line after at E EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E E Because VArs could be sold as real power System Control should not be allowed to establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules Rather Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires See also E establishing power factors E EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra We need to negotiate compensation E Giving Sierra sole discretion to determine unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System is too broad E Repots should be reports

cc Subject Governor Davis Announces Bill Package to Increase Renewable Energ y Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California

stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB Assuming its true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power and that this raised the market price in the NW by about per megawatthour and that this is costing the NW million per day at least for the period that Mary looked at that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit If we can establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Daviss handpicked ISO board the NW Senators will escape Earths gravitational pull For that very reason we have to be

Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California Governor Given that California is a critical part of a larger western regional power market how can we ensure that regional power needs are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board ANSWER We really cant Most of the time the Board has a limited

credence Forwarded by Mary HainHOUECT on PM Alan Comnes PM To Tim CT Susan J NRON Paul CT Jeff nron cc Subject Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests

Alan Comnes Earlier Email Here is another hefty ISO filing that came in this week Please let Sue o r I know if you believe we should interveneprotest Alan Comnes Summary of ISO Amendment Filed December Effective Date expedited treatment requested Protests Due January need to confirm this Filing in a Nutshell The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t o clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi on Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No According to the ISO Amendment has been accepted for filing suspended and set for hearing Settlement negotiations are ongoing Is Enron a par ty to these settlements In addition the ISO provides new transmission Acce ss Charge TAC rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci ty of Vernon joining the ISO effective January and the amount of Firm Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO Tariff Specific Proposed Changes Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the Wheeling Access Charge the proper calculation is to u se transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th e ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method New HV TAC Rates Using Year of the ISOs Proposed Transmission Methodo logy The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating TO Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO they are known as license plate rates Under Amendment No this met hodology continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO Once that occurs the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen ts of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area The filing claims to implement an alreadyapproved transition formula where in new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst em average embedded costs The goal is that after years there will be only high voltage access charge The following table shows that under the curren t method which would be a split of licenseplatesystemaverage charge s PGE and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately million and Vernon would be subsidized approximately million Calculation of the net benefitsburdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact PGE and SCE have a Million cap annually and SDGE has a Million cap annually Vernon is held harmless I OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota l capAdjusted Net Benefit Burden PGE SCE SDGE Vernon Total Note a positive number means the TAC is going up A negative number me ans the TAC is going down or will be lower than would be the case under license plate ratemaking Vernons Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs Veron by joining the ISO effective agrees to convert existing transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount The propos ed FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing These FTRs will expire when the underlying contract right

Trade Resources Corp From Meringolo Peter PM To Fergus Gary S Stephen C Hall Email cc Subject Draft letter to the CPUC Please let either Gary or me know your thoughts and comments regarding the below draft letter to the CPUC Thanks Peter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to contact me Sincerely Gary S Fergus This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may

summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No to close the bypass loophole She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldnt figure out a way to recover these costs Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities To Mary CT cc Subject Re Stranded costs I needed a response Thanks Mary Hain PM To Christi L CT cc Robert NRON James D nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Christopher F CT Chris H CT Paul CT Subject Re Stranded costs I think I know what youre talking about I know you werent asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No and A without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases In Order No FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee Par at So in general customers cant avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery Id at There appears to be a loophole that if applicable would allow bypass For contracts that dont contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision However in that case the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve Id at note Accordingly the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service If the loophole does not apply because the contract does not have such a notice provision the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable wherein the customer would have the burden of proof But if they do the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customers Section proceeding Order No A Par at Likewise if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs the customer must make any Section claim in that case Id The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs However FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required Order No at I dont know anything about what the individual states have done I hope this helps To Robert NRON cc James D nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Mary CT Subject Re Stranded costs Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several years ago However the commercial people would like to market this possibly to others not simply wholesale customers What happens at the retail level on stranded costs Thanks Robert NRON PM To Christi L CT cc James D CT Harry CT Joe CT Sarah CT Donna CT Mary CT Subject Re Stranded costs This is a FERC issue because its would involve wholesale stranded costs Joe and Sarah will correct me if Im wrong but I believe Order provides that if the muni or other wholesale customer is able to bypass the transmission facilities of its former provider and I believe there is dispute over what constitutes bypass then they may be able to avoid stranded cost liability From Christi L Nicolay ECT PM To James D nron Robert nron Harry nron Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Mary CT cc Subject Stranded costs I had a question from the commercial people about whether a muni could build a new interconnection to another utility to avoid stranded costs of the incumbent utility While the particular question happened to be in Indiana and I sent them to Janine they were stating that this stranded cost avoidance is something that they may want to tout as a benefit of building new interconnections I think that we would look initially to the state restructuring law to see if this is specifically addressed However I recall someone saying that there may be a constitutional question as to whether an incumbent utility can charge stranded costs to someone who leaves its system but I dont think this has been addressed at the appellate or Supreme Court level I want to make sure that our commercial people know what is the status of the law in this area I would appreciate any help on this Thanks

call IMAGE IssueAlert for March PGOCorp Receives Billion To Partially Pay Off Debts by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis PGOCorp parent of nearly bankrupt utility PGOCo announced that it has closed a billion loan agreement that will allow it to pay various debts including its defaulted fourth quarter dividend to shareholders The loans provided by GE Capital Structured Finance Group and Lehman Brothers will be secured by the companys equity interest in PGONational Energy Group LLC Analysis Although this may seem like a positive step for the troubled utility PGOCos partial payment pales in comparison to its outstanding debt Making matters even worse for the company is a new wave of lawsuits seeking restitution in the amount of billion The loans which PGOCorp was able to secure due to the strong performance of its National Energy Group subsidiary have enabled the corporation to pay its outstanding debt obligations on which it has defaulted or would default in the near future The obligations that have been paid include million in payments to commercial paper holders million in borrowings under a revolving credit agreement and million owned to PGOCorporation common shareholders for the defaulted Q dividend The loan which has a term of two years includes an option that depending on certain factors would give the lenders between and percent of the shares in National Energy Group In addition the loan agreement prohibits PGOfrom declaring or paying future common stock dividends until the loans are repaid In an effort to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy on Jan PGOCorp halted payment of its fourth quarter dividend which had been declared on Oct and was due to be payable on Jan Soon after that the company announced that it would not be able to make certain payments on commercial paper obligations Citing that the risk of bankruptcy played a factor in assuming the loan PGOCorp CEO and President Robert Glynn said that the financing would be repaid with PGOCorp shareholder dollars only In other words Glynn reassured customers of the utility that rates would not be increased as a mechanism to repay this loan However PGOcontinues its negotiations with Calif Gov Gray Davis to increase rates for at least a substantial part of losses already accrued due to skyrocketing prices in the wholesale market Reportedly as of Dec PGOhad racked up more than billion in undercollected costs In its K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission PGOCorp acknowledged that it would be damaged further if the California Public Utilities Commission adopts current power payment proposals without an electric rate increase Meanwhile a pending deal between PGOand Gov Davis is expected to include the sale of the utilitys transmission assets to the state of California much like PGEs counterpart Southern California Edison SCE has already done The bottom line of the loans is that PGOis removed from being in default on its credit agreements according to Greg Pruett vice president of corporate communications in an interview with CBSMarketWatchcom Pruett also said that the loans amounted to one less item of significance that the holding company has to attend to ensure it doesnt find itself in a situation where it could have creditors seeking to force it into bankruptcy However as noted just as PGOCorp received this loan the parent company and the utility announced that they have been hit with two lawsuits seeking a total of nearly billion in restitution PGOCorp and PGOCo on the basis of the newly secured loan say that they can only make partial payments of billion Both lawsuits were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Feb According to CBSMarketWatchcom one lawsuit alleges that PGOCorp violated its fiduciary duties by repurchasing common share of its PGOCo unit at a price of billion The second lawsuit claims that PGOCorp collected nearly billion from PGOCo under a taxsharing arrangement but paid only billion to all governments under the arrangement The plaintiff in both suits is identified only as Richard D Wilson who seeks to enjoin any more such buybacks unless good cause is shown and also seeks restitution of billion with interest from PGOCorp The parent company and utility have discounted the validity of the lawsuits although they said they were unable to predict any outcome or how it might their financial conditions In its most recent filing with the SEC PGOalso disclosed that the utility unit owes billion to the California Independent System Operator for December energy purchases and another million to a group of unidentified power generators for January deliveries At that time which was only a few days before PGOCorp secured the loans the company said it could only make partial payments of these debts on a pro rata basis As a result PGOCorp said it could only pay the California ISO about million and make payments of million to the power suppliers It appears that PGOCorp has not used any of the funds secured in its loans to make additional payments to the California ISO or power suppliers As noted PGEs subsidiary National Energy Group played a prominent role in its parents loans The loans will be secured by the companys equity interest in National Energy Group and the lenders could potentially gain a or percent interest in the subsidiary National Energy Group is PGOCorps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New England PGOCorp has previously claimed that its goal is for National Energy Group to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by While the regulated PGOCo continues to struggle in debt National Energy Group has been quite successful In fact much of PGOCorps earnings over came directly from National Energy Group which gained a percent profit increase in Q and an percent profit increase in Q Clearly PGOCorp has benefited greatly from National Energy Groups ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside in deregulated markets outside of California Thus it is no wonder that although PGOCorp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated Just last month PGOCorp gained approval to implement a shrewd restructuring of its business units that protects National Energy Group and other highprofit subsidiaries from any impact that the bankruptcy of the regulated utility or parent company might cause In other words if PGOCorp and PGOCo ultimately declare bankruptcy subsidiaries such as National Energy Group would not bear any foreseeable impact protecting some of PGEs most profitable business units from financial insolvency Ironically however through this loan there is now a tie between the unregulated business of National Energy Group and the regulated PGOCo although the ramifications of this connection are not completely clear at this time Moreover while the loan that PGOhas secured certainly helps it by no means brings an end to the utilitys financial problems Through the loan PGOhas been enabled to pay outstanding debt obligations on which it has already defaulted or may default on in the near future However the payments made in the amount of billion only reflect a small percentage of PGEs reported billion of total debt Thus bankruptcy is still a strong possibility for the company unless some other new major development occurs Most likely this development will be the sale of its transmission system to the state PGOmay have to lower its expectations of what it believes its system to be worth reportedly billion However just as SCE has now been apparently protected from bankruptcy filing due to the sale of its own transmission system PGOmay also find that an asset sale is its only recourse at this juncture An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests

requested The available transmision capacity ATC derate did occur and has occured everydaysince about the th This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday Although we do not have the Emails anymore the ISO sends our traders Emails everyday about the ATC on the ties so this information is verifiable with the ISO Our customer contact didnt know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage emergency The line was again rated at zero today I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved Ive talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press So check the trade press tomorrow Paul Kaufman PM To WTCOM Mary CT cc Subject RE Questions you requested I agree with Craig we need to be really really careful about the earth orbit issues identified below We shouldnt talk about the derating issue unless we can confirm the derating occurred and document it tie the derating directly to action by the new board ie determine that it wasnt due to maintenance or some other physical occurence show a direct impact on PNW prices that cant be easily explained in another way and show a continuing pattern in contrast to an isolated event Forwarded by Paul KaufmanPDXECT on PM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Gannett Craig WTCOM PM To cc Hain Mary Robertson Linda Kaufman Paul Subject RE Questions you requested This excellent material and very important but its pretty esoteric If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins use Marys stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB Assuming its true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power and that this raised the market price in the NW by about per megawatthour and that this is costing the NW million per day at least for the period that Mary looked at that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit If we can establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Daviss handpicked ISO board the NW Senators will escape Earths gravitational pull For that very reason we have to be able to back up anything we say and we need to anticipate any defenses the ISO may have But if you want NW elected officials to quit being so polite toward Davis that will do it Craig Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday January AM To Cc Subject Questions you requested Joshua I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so believe the attached QA meet your request If you need additional materials just let me know See attached file Ron Wyden Qs for Steve Keandoc In addition EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of any of the EPSA witnesses Reliant Calpine Williams or Enron dealing with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California Independent System Operator Background The Cal ISO acts as the air traffic controller for the interstate electric power grid in California The ISO determines who gets access to the grid and under what terms and conditions It is the ISO that helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and nondiscriminatory When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago a stakeholder management board was created that represented a wide range of market interestspower sellers generators consumers political leaders etc After the power emergencies began last summer this board was criticized as too splintered and indecisive In a response to this perception and in an effort to impose greater control over the ISO the California state legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a fiveperson board that serves at the request of the California Governor QUESTION The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California Governor Given that California is a critical part of a larger western regional power market how can we ensure that regional power needs are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board ANSWER We really cant Most of the time the Board has a limited role However the traffic controller role becomes crucial when the power crunch comes Every market participant needs to be worried that during times of real power emergencies the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first and ask questions later Companies with firm transactions involving outofstate entities may find their needs and commercial interests sacrificed to prevent local political problems Instead of robust competitive regional markets politicizing transmission decisions practically guarantees an increasingly balkanized market

cc Subject Governor Davis Announces Bill Package to Increase Renewable Energ y Distributed Generation and Cogeneration The Governor held his press conference today at the cogeneration plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento All local TV print and radio news media outlets sent representatives Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities lines with the companies continuing to maintain them to capture the utilities expertise Details of this plan will be announced on Friday the Governor said The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released The Governor later said he felt the utilities parentholding companies should be part of the solution so there would be shared pain in reaching a solution The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines will involve the sale of revenue bonds but he didnt have enough wisdom when asked about it to give a firm answer He said he believed he would have that wisdom on Friday The Governor also commented on his plan to police andor fine business establishments that keep their lights on after business hours He said he would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar a specific program to reduce by the amount of energy used by retailers afterhours The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration through incentives rebates and tax credits The package contains Rebate Increase Bill Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the Renewable Resource Trust Fund million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than kilowatts this money will come from the General Fund Tax Credit Bill SB X Brulte A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program AB X Reyes million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities This proposal will provide million to achieve MW of reduced peak load through retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less than MW from Standby Charges Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt Please find the text of the Governors press release for this news conference below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE pm GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND COGENERATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide incentives to power up more renewable energy distributed generation and cogeneration to help meet Californias energy challenge By investing in renewable energy sources clean distributed generation and cogeneration we can increase our energy supply without taking power away from the grid Governor Davis said My generation plan contains the most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation Distributed generation and cogeneration are powerful tools for meeting Californias power needs These types of facilities reduce demand on the state power grid They also provide energy independence from the Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market advanced technology that creates jobs as well as power and reliable energy sources that respect the environment Governor Davis legislative package for distributed generation cogeneration and renewable energy includes million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation systems smaller than ten kilowatts A tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than kilowatts and up to kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses This will be carried in SB x by Senator Jim Brulte RCucamonga million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems distributed generation and cogeneration facilities This will be carried in AB x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes DFresno million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by municipal water districts to improve environmental performance This involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural gas technology Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation enduse customers to the Investor Owned Utilities This includes small cogeneration facilities and only applies to units that generate less than one megawatt The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass legislation to implement these proposals Cogeneration is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or steam usually on an industrial site Typically the electricity is sold to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to generating electricity Generally the electricity is generated on the site where it is being used It can include renewables such as solar or wind power fuel cells and microgenerators Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant in Sacramento The plant supplies not only all of the electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling for the UC Davis Medical Center It produces MW of power Since the Medical Center needs less than half of that the excess power is sold back to the ISO which pays the Centers utility bills The UC Davis Medical Center CoGeneration Plant is a selfsufficient facility Governor Davis added It is an efficient facility It is a clean facility And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of to meet our peak energy demands Governor Davis energy plan relies on three elements stabilization conservation and generation The Governor is working with legislative leadership on a stabilization plan for the States Investor Owned Utilities Over the last several weeks Governor Davis unveiled an aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced and sold in California 
<20798193.1075860389198.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2001-02-15 08:46:00,My comments on Sierra Pacifics Draft interconnection agreement Cc are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement In the sixth whereas page and Sections and the contract states that either the generating company or the generating companys customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed Specifically a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability or privity of contract to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific For example the generator may sell the power to Dynegy who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service The eighth Whereas page and Sections E E E E E E E E E and E state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System RMS Agreement I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the good utility practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement Enron has signed the RMS Agreement I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and in order for RTO West to form BPA must agree to join Enron is very interested in RTO West forming If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard Section Contrary to our requests this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective This is not the way the OATT operates Rather if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC as we have done and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierras open access tariff Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies The FERC has determined that filings under Section and therefor of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely undermine the purpose of Order No Section After by both parties add however if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT Section Three years advance written notice is too long A reasonable notice period would be Section and EPMI opposes the definitions of Applicable Laws Applicable Permits and Applicable Reliability Criteria because when combined with their use throughout the contract in Sections E E E E E and E they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action Section Section i of the definition of Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for the most reliable supply Change the most reliable to a reliable Section Is inconsistent with Sierras OATT It should be written using the same words as the OATT Section The reference to Section should be corrected to Section Definition of System Integrity is too broad When combined with Section it would require our generator to not have an adverse impact on maximizing the health welfare safety of personnel and the general public While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not Section The proposed Use of System Integrity here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the Good Utility Practice standard Section Shouldnt the word unplanned be added before the word Outages Section EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others Section The second sentence exposes EPMI to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion Editorial note the third to last sentence is missing a period Section See comments under Section Section EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract Accordingly the words or ordered by FERC should be deleted EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra with FERCs approval to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierras facilities Section Should the words generating companys applicable FERCapproved tariff be changed to Applicable Law Section EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than percent Under FERCs precedent EPMI is only required to pay actual cost Section Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice The words plus Interest should be added after the words difference in the fourth sentence Section This section says essentially the same thing as Section and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons Section Add period at end of sentence Section Delete period after the word and in last sentence Section Add period after Interconnection Facilities Section EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties Section Delete the word and on the seventh line Section See comments under Sections Section Delete pennits from last line on page and insert permits Section After remediation or abatement activity insert pay all fines penalties or compensations as required by law Section There should be a reciprocal provision for generators Section EPMI opposes regulatory Force Majeure Section This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI Section Add the letter y after and ma on the second line Section Third to last line change ahs to has Section Needs to be edited Section This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTOs requirements Section By law System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection Section This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERCs pro forma OATT under Order No Section of the contract retains EPMIs rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates terms or conditions etc of the interconnection agreement Exhibit D D EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties D The phrase Except under Applicable Law should be added before the first sentence D EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierras discretion Accordingly EPMI opposes this entire provision If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs EPMI would agree to provide level of VArs at rate EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierras discretion subject to this rate in the case of an Emergency Otherwise EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power instead of VArs to the market at a marketbased rate and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierras discretion without being assured the cost of cover Accordingly the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory D EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service D Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of realtime load following service Accordingly this provision should be deleted D EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted Sierra should get ancillary services from the market E Change minimized to minimize E Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator may affect System Integrity E EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to approve Planned Outage Schedules E Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term System Integrity here as too high as standard E The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages E Add the word the on line after at E EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E E Because VArs could be sold as real power System Control should not be allowed to establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules Rather Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires See also E establishing power factors E EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra We need to negotiate compensation E Giving Sierra sole discretion to determine unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System is too broad E Repots should be reports

call IMAGE IssueAlert for March PGOCorp Receives Billion To Partially Pay Off Debts by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis PGOCorp parent of nearly bankrupt utility PGOCo announced that it has closed a billion loan agreement that will allow it to pay various debts including its defaulted fourth quarter dividend to shareholders The loans provided by GE Capital Structured Finance Group and Lehman Brothers will be secured by the companys equity interest in PGONational Energy Group LLC Analysis Although this may seem like a positive step for the troubled utility PGOCos partial payment pales in comparison to its outstanding debt Making matters even worse for the company is a new wave of lawsuits seeking restitution in the amount of billion The loans which PGOCorp was able to secure due to the strong performance of its National Energy Group subsidiary have enabled the corporation to pay its outstanding debt obligations on which it has defaulted or would default in the near future The obligations that have been paid include million in payments to commercial paper holders million in borrowings under a revolving credit agreement and million owned to PGOCorporation common shareholders for the defaulted Q dividend The loan which has a term of two years includes an option that depending on certain factors would give the lenders between and percent of the shares in National Energy Group In addition the loan agreement prohibits PGOfrom declaring or paying future common stock dividends until the loans are repaid In an effort to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy on Jan PGOCorp halted payment of its fourth quarter dividend which had been declared on Oct and was due to be payable on Jan Soon after that the company announced that it would not be able to make certain payments on commercial paper obligations Citing that the risk of bankruptcy played a factor in assuming the loan PGOCorp CEO and President Robert Glynn said that the financing would be repaid with PGOCorp shareholder dollars only In other words Glynn reassured customers of the utility that rates would not be increased as a mechanism to repay this loan However PGOcontinues its negotiations with Calif Gov Gray Davis to increase rates for at least a substantial part of losses already accrued due to skyrocketing prices in the wholesale market Reportedly as of Dec PGOhad racked up more than billion in undercollected costs In its K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission PGOCorp acknowledged that it would be damaged further if the California Public Utilities Commission adopts current power payment proposals without an electric rate increase Meanwhile a pending deal between PGOand Gov Davis is expected to include the sale of the utilitys transmission assets to the state of California much like PGEs counterpart Southern California Edison SCE has already done The bottom line of the loans is that PGOis removed from being in default on its credit agreements according to Greg Pruett vice president of corporate communications in an interview with CBSMarketWatchcom Pruett also said that the loans amounted to one less item of significance that the holding company has to attend to ensure it doesnt find itself in a situation where it could have creditors seeking to force it into bankruptcy However as noted just as PGOCorp received this loan the parent company and the utility announced that they have been hit with two lawsuits seeking a total of nearly billion in restitution PGOCorp and PGOCo on the basis of the newly secured loan say that they can only make partial payments of billion Both lawsuits were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Feb According to CBSMarketWatchcom one lawsuit alleges that PGOCorp violated its fiduciary duties by repurchasing common share of its PGOCo unit at a price of billion The second lawsuit claims that PGOCorp collected nearly billion from PGOCo under a taxsharing arrangement but paid only billion to all governments under the arrangement The plaintiff in both suits is identified only as Richard D Wilson who seeks to enjoin any more such buybacks unless good cause is shown and also seeks restitution of billion with interest from PGOCorp The parent company and utility have discounted the validity of the lawsuits although they said they were unable to predict any outcome or how it might their financial conditions In its most recent filing with the SEC PGOalso disclosed that the utility unit owes billion to the California Independent System Operator for December energy purchases and another million to a group of unidentified power generators for January deliveries At that time which was only a few days before PGOCorp secured the loans the company said it could only make partial payments of these debts on a pro rata basis As a result PGOCorp said it could only pay the California ISO about million and make payments of million to the power suppliers It appears that PGOCorp has not used any of the funds secured in its loans to make additional payments to the California ISO or power suppliers As noted PGEs subsidiary National Energy Group played a prominent role in its parents loans The loans will be secured by the companys equity interest in National Energy Group and the lenders could potentially gain a or percent interest in the subsidiary National Energy Group is PGOCorps unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast primarily in New England PGOCorp has previously claimed that its goal is for National Energy Group to be in a position to contribute percent of earnings for the parent company by While the regulated PGOCo continues to struggle in debt National Energy Group has been quite successful In fact much of PGOCorps earnings over came directly from National Energy Group which gained a percent profit increase in Q and an percent profit increase in Q Clearly PGOCorp has benefited greatly from National Energy Groups ability as an unregulated subsidiary to sell power outside in deregulated markets outside of California Thus it is no wonder that although PGOCorp still considers California to be an attractive market the core driver of its strategy is NEG which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated Just last month PGOCorp gained approval to implement a shrewd restructuring of its business units that protects National Energy Group and other highprofit subsidiaries from any impact that the bankruptcy of the regulated utility or parent company might cause In other words if PGOCorp and PGOCo ultimately declare bankruptcy subsidiaries such as National Energy Group would not bear any foreseeable impact protecting some of PGEs most profitable business units from financial insolvency Ironically however through this loan there is now a tie between the unregulated business of National Energy Group and the regulated PGOCo although the ramifications of this connection are not completely clear at this time Moreover while the loan that PGOhas secured certainly helps it by no means brings an end to the utilitys financial problems Through the loan PGOhas been enabled to pay outstanding debt obligations on which it has already defaulted or may default on in the near future However the payments made in the amount of billion only reflect a small percentage of PGEs reported billion of total debt Thus bankruptcy is still a strong possibility for the company unless some other new major development occurs Most likely this development will be the sale of its transmission system to the state PGOmay have to lower its expectations of what it believes its system to be worth reportedly billion However just as SCE has now been apparently protected from bankruptcy filing due to the sale of its own transmission system PGOmay also find that an asset sale is its only recourse at this juncture An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Document link Mary Hain OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Document link Mary Hain OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Document link Mary Hain OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Document link Mary Hain OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO

the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the

When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS Document link Mary Hain OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system

so it is conceivable that for example directors show up of which are transmission owners and the transmission owners are able to pass any resoultion they wish Related to this issue is the inability of one membership group such as the power marketers group to be able to veto a proposal It will take three membership classes acting in unison plus two other votes to defeat a proposed action by the

sword On the one hand as members of WSCC it will help to protect us from antitrust liability On the other hand only full members of WSCC are obligated under the ADR provisions Section so just like the ADR provisions of NRTAWRTASWRTA entities merely have to quit WSCC to get out of the ADR obligation This is especially problematic with entities that are not FERC jurisdictional But I think on balance we are probably more concerned about the antitrust protection given that the WSCC usually makes decisions that effect operating systems much more than marketers although this is changing over time What do others think I agree with the proposal to have binding arbitration for such controversial matters as transmission path ratings Section The lack of such a mechanism has created extended FERC litigation concerning the Alturas line Further I agree with the grounds for appealing the arbitration decision contrary to law arbitrary and capricious lack of a fair hearing or serious arbitrator misconduct Section However the process for requiring FERC filings under Sections seem to undermine the binding nature of the arbitration provisions To really be binding it seems like once the appeals process has been completed Section should require the prevailing and nonprevailing party to file joint filings to carry out the binding arbitration decisions From Joe NRON on PM CST To Mary CT cc

<21627254.1075859540675.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2000-12-05 03:22:00,WSCC ADR proposal Cc reviewed the ADR proposal and have the following comments This ADR proposal is a double edged sword On the one hand as members of WSCC it will help to protect us from antitrust liability On the other hand only full members of WSCC are obligated under the ADR provisions Section so just like the ADR provisions of NRTAWRTASWRTA entities merely have to quit WSCC to get out of the ADR obligation This is especially problematic with entities that are not FERC jurisdictional But I think on balance we are probably more concerned about the antitrust protection given that the WSCC usually makes decisions that effect operating systems much more than marketers although this is changing over time What do others think I agree with the proposal to have binding arbitration for such controversial matters as transmission path ratings Section The lack of such a mechanism has created extended FERC litigation concerning the Alturas line Further I agree with the grounds for appealing the arbitration decision contrary to law arbitrary and capricious lack of a fair hearing or serious arbitrator misconduct Section However the process for requiring FERC filings under Sections seem to undermine the binding nature of the arbitration provisions To really be binding it seems like once the appeals process has been completed Section should require the prevailing and nonprevailing party to file joint filings to carry out the binding arbitration decisions From Joe NRON on PM CST To Mary CT cc

CT Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT John M CT Greg CT Mary CT Elizabeth CT cc Subject Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Halls summary Theres some redundancy but hopefully this provides a few more details Also Mary H and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to approve the ISOs request in full Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO ISOs MWh Soft Cap a Summarized ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the MWh proposed by the FERC The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e Commissions November Order The ISOs scheduling system will not r eject Energy bids priced in excess of the MWh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order However if the ISO issues Dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the Market Clearing Price for Imbalance Energy Rather those Scheduling Coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b Refund risk and cost documentation above Imbalance Energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the Commission It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission a s well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the Commissions attention i Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the FERC See p ii Regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs However no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs In a footnote to cover letter ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or MWh whichever is lesser c Useful quote In light of current fuel prices and the ISOs recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the ISO believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an asbid basis d Effective date pm PST e Term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the Commissi on supercedes it by its own order f Applicable tariff sections Section and See attachments AB to the filing Participating Generator Penalties a Summary the ISO proposes in Amendment No to assess penalties ag ainst Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency They would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea ch hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond In addition i f during that hour the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver b Allowed excuse The penalties would not apply if the Participating Generator has notified the ISO within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its Generating Unit System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c Applicable tariff sections Amends portions of and See attachments AB to the filing d Effective date Same as the ISOs new soft cap pm PST e Term I did not see any sort of sunset provision Load Imbalance Penalties a Summary Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that market to serve t heir Loads the ISOs costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose d soft price cap or through

IMMEDIATE RELEASE December GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION SACRAMENTO In response to actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday Governor Gray Davis issued the following statement The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has abdicated its responsibility to the people in the West Their responsibility is to ensure just and reasonable rates Instead they have chosen to ensure unconscionable profits for the pirate generators and power brokers who are gouging California consumers and businesses Make no mistake By its unwarranted actions today FERC itself has substantially raised consumer electricity rates in California I urge the Public Utilities Commission to take all appropriate action to cushion the impact of this FERCprovoked rate increase But by refusing to impose regional price caps and by seeking to deny California control over the Independent System Operator FERC has sided against California consumers and businesses This is an inexplicable decision by armchair Washington bureaucrats fixated on economic ideology that has no practical application to the dysfunctional energy market in California and the West Instead of acting in the best interests of consumers and businesses the FERC commissioners have acted as pawns of generators and power sellers whose only interest is to plunder our economy FERCs failure to act in the interest of our consumers and businesses literally invites California to act to regain control over the energy market Given this decision California now must move forward on both legal and legislative fronts to assure stabilization generation and conservation Although we had hoped FERC would shoulder its responsibility we have not stood by idly waiting for them to rescue California Already we have taken the first steps by encouraging the construction of new generation in California The Energy Commission has approved eight new power plants since April Another is on the agenda for action next week Twentytwo more applications are pending and the Governors Green Team is working to accelerate permitting Were working closely with the California Air Resources Board and local air districts to find solutions to emissions problems Last week we were able to put megawatts of power back online to help us through the current crisis And well do more Weve refocused longidle energy conservation programs to save electricity and weve added million from the States General Fund to get conservation programs online by this summer The State under the guidance of the Secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency and the Department of Water Resources has been contributing up to megawattsaday to the conservation efforts of consumers and businesses throughout the state Large industrial users have borne a particularly heavy burden through their interruptible contracts Now in response to FERCs failure to meet its obligations I will call the California Legislature into concurrent Special Session to do at least the following Replace the socalled stakeholders on the ISO Board with Californians who are more concerned about the prices consumers and businesses pay for power than they are about the profits their companies make Reestablish the authority for the state to inspect private power plants to assure the coordination of maintenance and operating schedules Last week alone more than megawatts of power were offline with half of that in unscheduled outages Provide lowinterest financing for new peaking facilities or repowering old ones to make them cleaner and more efficient in return for committing their power to Californians at guaranteed low rates We also need to work together to conserve energy We must quickly develop programs that large industrial and commercial companies can participate in that are reasonable and predictable We must redouble our efforts to educate and involve consumers in conservation efforts that will save energy and money I will be reserving billion in my January budget for these purposes We also must ensure that there is enough electricity generation built in California to get us through the current crisis and to allow the continuing growth of our economy We need to continue the efforts started under AB through the Governors Green Team to site new generation and to repower old dirty power plants with new cleaner more efficient equipment Making a dirty power plant clean can also improve its efficiency by percent We need to explore new opportunities to produce power through the Department of Water and Power Hydroelectric power generated by the State Water Project has helped us through the crisis of the last few weeks And we need to encourage the development of cogeneration and distributed generation for businesses throughout California Finally we need to find a way to stabilize electricity rates for all Californians that does not bankrupt our utilities but at the same time keeps the pressure on the utilities and the pirate generators and power brokers to keep prices down There will be pain but everyone must share that pain A critical step to making this happen is to stop the bleeding that is occurring even today as the greed of the generators and marketeers threatens our economy Toward that end I am asking the Attorney General to expand his investigation to include civil and criminal violations that may have occurred in relation to operations practices of the generators and the pricing of natural gas This investigation should include coordination with federal authorities to determine if violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act have occurred The public health and safety of Californias citizens and the economy of the State cannot be subject to the blackmail of a few greedy privateers working in concert with a handful of Washington bureaucrats FERC has shirked its duty to the people and businesses of California I will not allow our state to be victimized by unfettered marketers I will do whatever it takes to protect the economy and security of the people of California Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy

Newswires GMTDJ California Suit Names Sempra El Paso Gas As Defendants MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Alleges Cos Agreed To Monopolize Mkt LOS ANGELES Dow JonesTwo lawsuits seeking class action status were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday alleging three major energy companies conspired to monoploize the natural gas market in southern California and artificially increase prices and create shortages The complaints name Sempra Energy SRE and its affiliates San Diego Gas Electric Co and Southern California Gas along with El Paso Natural Gas Corp as defendants The complaint claims the companies were involved in massive conspiracy and together agreed to artificially constrict the supply of the commodity by killing natural gas pipeline projects The complaint alleges unfair competition and unlawful business practices According to the complaint top executives of SoCal Gas SDGE and El Paso Natural Gas Corp met at a Phoenix hotel in and fearing a new era of open competition and lower natural gas prices the executives gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies illegally agreed not to compete against each other in Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets the complaint states They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowere natural gas prices in these markets The defendants have not yet seen a copy of the complaint and were unable to comment MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Plaintiffs Seek Billions In Damages The lawsuit claims that El Paso Natural Gas and Sempra and its afilliates conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them resulting in lower natural gas prices The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages The complaint alleges that in Tenneco Inc completed the Kern River Pipeline which transports natural gas from Wyoming to Kern County Calif Tenneco then began to plan for additional pipelines that would bypass SoCal Gas and SDGE pipelines and deliver gas directly to consumers in San Diego Los Angeles Imperial Valley and the Baja Peninisula One of those bypass pipelines the Altamont pipeline would have transportecd gas from Canada to the northern end of the kern River pipeline in Wyoming Tenneco envisioned that low cost Canadian gas would be carried to Southern California and Baja customers according to the complaint El Paso acquired Tenneco in June shortly before California opened up its electricity market to competition According to the complaint three months later SoCal Gas SDGE and El Paso met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near the Phoenix airport and began to hatch a conspiracy that the energy companies would eliminate Tennecos pipeline projects and continue to dominate the natural gas market via SoCal Gas being the sole bidder on the Baja pipeline SoCal Gas then allegedly agreed to refrain from competing with El Paso on a pipeline project in Mexico The transportation constraints which the conspirators created eliminate competition from Canadian gas radically drove up the price of gas and electricity and discouraged the building of new electric generation plants to serve the California market the complaint states Natural gas in California has spiked to a record per million British thermal unit last week and still hovers at around mbtu compared with a year ago Sempra Energy spokesman Art Larson said his company has not yet been served with a copy of the complaint but any claims that Sempra violated antitrust or other laws are completely false On Dec SDGE filed for emergency relief asking federal regulators to impose a price cap on natural gas

Lockyer to investigate whether natural gas suppliers have manipulated the market in an effort to drive up prices By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT GMT December DJ Lawmakers Ask Justice Dept To Probe Calif PwrNatural Gas WASHINGTON Dow JonesTwo California lawmakers have asked the US Department of Justice to investigate potential collusion in the states highly volatile electricity and natural gas markets The lawmakers US Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif and John Burton president pro tempore of the California State Senate asked Attorney General Janet Reno to take immediate steps to investigate California markets for electricity and natural gas We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers the letter said The lawmakers questioned whether repairs or maintenance were truly behind why a quarter of the states generating plants werent operating in recent weeks contributing to the latest powersupply emergency in California Some have suggested that one reason for power plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market the lawmakers said The Department of Justice must act to ensure that collusion and other unlawful acts are not contributing to the crisis in Californias power markets they told Reno The probe must begin now despite the pending change in presidential administrations next month to set a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow Boxer and Burton wrote There was no immediate response from the Justice Department to the letter which was dated Friday Id be very surprised if the Justice Department found any gaming or violation of the law said Lynne Church president of the Electric Power Supply Association whose members operate deregulated power generation facilities in California Any DOJ investigation would be on top of probes already under way by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state of California and others she said Im not too nervous about that one Church said of the prospect of DOJ joining the fray Neither the California Independent System Operator nor officials in the Pacific Northwest found any evidence of pricegouging in separate investigations they conducted Church noted Power prices skyrocketed in California because of the flawed market structure state officials imposed she said Theres no doubt those markets went higher than they would have if that structure were not

David CT Tim CT Robert CT Dennis ES Roger ES Elsa nron James D ES Scott NRON Bruno ES Jeff ES Mona L ES Sandra ES Chris H CT Paul CT Steven J ES Mary CT cc Subject GREAT NEWS FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO Dan Douglass summarized this This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call

AM To cc Subject THE WINNERS IN CALIFORNIA DJ POWER POINTS Winners In Billion Calif Sweepstakes By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesNow that PGE Corp PCG Edison International EIX and Sempra Energy SRE have announced that about billion in power costs flew out their windows this summer Wall Street might be curious to know on which corporate doorsteps the windfall landed A few of the beneficiaries have indicated publicly how well they did this summer Weve supplemented those announcements with data on market share conversations with western US electricity traders second quarter earnings reports and publicly available information from the California Independent System Operator operator of the states highvoltage transmission grid and realtime power market to create this Top list of winners in the Summer of Luck No Duke Energy Corp DUK Calpine Corp CPN and AES Corp AES These companies with significant merchant power plants in California didnt make as much money as they could have because they sold their power before prices started rising AES for starters has sold the vast majority of the capacity of its California naturalgas fired generators under a longterm fixedprice contract to make power for another company a company much higher on this list which supplies the natural gas and owns the electricity Duke with megawatts of generators in California lost out on significant potential income because it sold most of its power months before prices started to rise No Electricity trading companies These companies like Utilicorp Uniteds UCU Aquila Citizens Power now owned by Edison International and Belgian company Tractebels BTRB US unit mostly traded in and out of positions and they made good profits doing so This group also includes the unregulated trading units of Sempra and PGE No Western utilities with power to spare namely Arizona Public Service Co the Public Service Co of New Mexico PNM and IdaCorp Incs IDA Idaho Power PNM said on Sept that it made million in wholesale marketing during July and August a increase over the same two months last year Arizona Public Service which is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corp PNW had considerably more power to sell than PNM market sources said No TransAlta TTA and PPL Global PPL Western electricity prices have been high outside California as well TransAlta and PPL reached deals to buy two major coalfired power plants in the Northwest last year and took ownership before this summer Unlike gas coal is still cheap No Enron Corp ENE El Paso Energy EPG and the energy trading unit of Morgan StanleyDean Witter MWD Unlike the inandout traders these companies bet on rising prices and came into the summer holding large supplies in the West electricity traders said Enron just bought and bought and bought before the summer and never seemed to sell said one trader El Paso also owns MW of generation in California No The US Federal Government and the State of Arizona Federal utility Bonneville Power Administration and Arizona public utility Salt River Project rode to Californias rescue on the hottest days this summer providing hundreds of megawatts of supply at top dollar No Californias independent generators The merchant power companies in California that did the best this summer are Reliant Energy Inc REI with about MW of California capacity Southern Co SO with about MW NRG Energy NRG with MW and Dynegy Inc DYN with MW Unlike Duke AES and Calpine these companies held on to most of their power and sold it in the dayahead and realtime markets where prices turned out to be best Reliant has already indicated that third quarter earnings available for equity will top last years figure by about million All of these companies however saw their windfall trimmed by diversification Each owns gasfired and some oilfired merchant power plants in the eastern US where high fuel prices and low electricity prices have damped profits Weve had a good summer but we have a pretty balanced portfolio across the country Stephen Bergstrom president and chief executive of Dynegy said in an interview As good as the summer has been in the West its been as bad in the eastern half of the country No Los Angeles Dept of Water Power and its bondholders LADWP has about MW of generation or about MW more than it needs for its customers As LADWP general manager S David Freeman said a few weeks ago A blind pig could make money with that setup No The heavily taxed citizens of British Columbia Canada Their provincially owned utility BC Hydro has been very busy this summer turning free water into electricity worth hundreds of millions of dollars more than expected and flooding the provinces general funds With hydroelectric dam reservoirs the size of New England and transmission lines that can carry MW of southbound power BC Hydro has singlehandedly kept socialism solvent for another year in British Columbia And the Grand Prize winner in the California Utilities Sweepstakes Williams Companies WMB the company AESs generators are working for Williams controls almost MW of gasfired generation in the San Diego area a little more than of what Californias utilities need on average during daylight hours in the summer Whats more those plants are under contract as resource must run with the ISO Their power cant be sold in the forward market Williams had to take daily and realtime market prices by default which is exactly what you would have done to maximize profits And Williams isnt hurt by the factors that have diluted other companies California gains It isnt very exposed in the East and as a big producer of natural gas its benefiting from high gas prices nationwide Just to give an idea of how well the company likely has done this summer consider that Williams second quarter profit from its energy services segment rose to million this year from million in the second quarter of That in a quarter with one and a half months of soaring prices In the

Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoeckers Congressional Testimony Law changes needed for retroactive refunds FERCS Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Date October FERC Chairman James Hoecker D told a congressional panel that the commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against market power in a competitive environment Hoecker also urged the congressmen to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility industrys transition to competition Hoeckers plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California where some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this summer Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the states bulk power markets it is clear that currently the commission does not have that authority to do so retroactively The Federal Power Act would have to be changed a FERC staffer says For its own study which began in August Hoecker claimed that the commission if proven necessary would consider ordering refunds if market participants were indeed price gouging However the Federal Power Act FPA the law that gives the commission much of its authority does not consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is probably needed to see if the commission can do that If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept If market power is being exercised we will respond accordingly by revoking or modifying marketbased rates or reassuring the basis upon which we grant them We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA if refunds are justified by record evidence However the FPA defines the commissions authority and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures with California and other states Currently the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions made days after the commission initiates an investigation which in this case would be Oct However the law makes no mention of retroactive ratemaking and FERC officials admit that to do so the law needs to be changed Based upon what I know the authority of the commission to issue refunds for any period before days following our investigation order is highly problematic Commissioner William Massey D told Electric Power Alert There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that it would be unlawful and we would need legislation to do that The Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep Dan Burton RIN held a midafternoon Sept hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a severe energy crisis this winter The committee heard testimony from Hoecker Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Carol Browner Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets but both Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year Richardson expressed his disappointment that nothing passed while Hoecker claimed that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United States under the same rules for nondiscriminatory open access and comparable service Hoecker said The commissions open access rules are not binding on the part of the nations transmission system owned or controlled by entities other than public utilities Open access over the facilities of public power and other nonpublic utilities would promote greater competition in wholesale markets by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers and sellers Hoecker pointed to FERCs investigation into bulk power markets and Californias energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives clear legislative direction FERC will extremely limited in what it could do to solve the market problems Congress too has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices Hoecker said Most critically events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate investment in generation and transmission facilities and higher levels of reliability which is crucial to the digital economy The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability standards Currently the House is considering a bill that would make the commission a federal backstop for reliability but most congressional sources do not expect

HainHOUECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Fwd Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs FYI ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Tue Oct From Tracey Bradley To Deanna King Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Subject Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline FYI It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many in the industry including by the CAISO Portland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain North County Times Escondido Calif October Oct PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer The state enjoyed a percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the states power manager declared separate power emergencies because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigation The author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices and consumer electricity bills shot to well above the generating plants cost of production The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors emissions We are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market power in action Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants in this case suppliers to influence prices Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the EPA Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant Encinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution limits But David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets That cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In North County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency shutdown because of heavy output Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off I cant comment Lloyd said We certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We dont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We want to run all we can when the prices are high Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the million customers of San Diego Gas Electric Co and causing an estimated billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond million if high wholesale prices persist No fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation were launched in July and August Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used Chief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to other Western states British Columbia and northern Mexico McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was one of deep skepticism EPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data from the EPA Greed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours where instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were cranking it out Wolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer At the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import electricity Others said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply Ron Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said market information is routinely withheld from regulators the public and buyers of electricity but is shared among power generators and trading companies If the market is sharing it with themselves but not us I dont buy that Eachus said Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled proprietary by companies such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for should be made available instantly to the markets Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally Belden said California is characterized by secret black box market models that nobody understands he said If youve got nothing to hide release the data To see more of the North County Times or to subscribe to the newspaper go to c North County Times Escondido Calif

REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations Thank you for coming out here today Julee MalinowskiBall Legislative AnalystAssociate CalETCEdsonModisette Fax or

Stanley Complaint Against ISO Dan Douglass summarized this This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do FERC reiterates that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a cap on ISO purchases ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to file with FERC wait days and amend its contract Forwarded by Susan J MaraSFOEES on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom on PM To cc Subject FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO We have good news on the ISO price caps front The FERC has made it clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps On Friday the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc MS As you may recall MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISOs maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule h which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint warrants expeditious action As a quick background summary for you last November FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment which extended ISOs price cap authority through That order stated that the ISO maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets FERC notes in Fridays Order that the the ISOs Board resolution lowered the caps to and ISO further directed that To the extent permitted by law regulation and preexisting contract Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds MW The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISOs justification for the price cap reduction FERC denied the MS stay request as well as its request that the maximum purchase price be reinstated The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO the ISO cannot dictate their price Importantly however FERC also states that ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs Emphasis added FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market OOM calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price Also with regard to the ISOs resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds MW FERC states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our November Order and the ISO tariff Emphasis added FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISOs market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISOs tariff This would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval As stated above our November Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase price ISO is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to straddle the fence and that Today the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps He also suggests that Getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid The record supports such a move He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control Hebert states that The independence of the ISOs governing structure stands threatened We should stand up to quote the resignation letter Hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the California markets This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO Please call if you have any questions Dan

Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT John M CT Greg CT Mary CT Elizabeth CT cc Subject Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Halls summary Theres some redundancy but hopefully this provides a few more details Also Mary H and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to approve the ISOs request in full Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO ISOs MWh Soft Cap a Summarized ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the MWh proposed by the FERC The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e Commissions November Order The ISOs scheduling system will not r eject Energy bids priced in excess of the MWh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order However if the ISO issues Dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the Market Clearing Price for Imbalance Energy Rather those Scheduling Coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b Refund risk and cost documentation above Imbalance Energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the Commission It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission a s well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the Commissions attention i Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the FERC See p ii Regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs However no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs In a footnote to cover letter ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or MWh whichever is lesser c Useful quote In light of current fuel prices and the ISOs recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the ISO believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an asbid basis d Effective date pm PST e Term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the Commissi on supercedes it by its own order f Applicable tariff sections Section and See attachments AB to the filing Participating Generator Penalties a Summary the ISO proposes in Amendment No to assess penalties ag ainst Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency They would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea ch hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond In addition i f during that hour the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver b Allowed excuse The penalties would not apply if the Participating Generator has notified the ISO within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its Generating Unit System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c

IMMEDIATE RELEASE December GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS ISSUES STATEMENT ON ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION SACRAMENTO In response to actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday Governor Gray Davis issued the following statement The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has abdicated its responsibility to the people in the West Their responsibility is to ensure just and reasonable rates Instead they have chosen to ensure unconscionable profits for the pirate generators and power brokers who are gouging California consumers and businesses Make no mistake By its unwarranted actions today FERC itself has substantially raised consumer electricity rates in California I urge the Public Utilities Commission to take all appropriate action to cushion the impact of this FERCprovoked rate increase But by refusing to impose regional price caps and by seeking to deny California control over the Independent System Operator FERC has sided against California consumers and businesses This is an inexplicable decision by armchair Washington bureaucrats fixated on economic ideology that has no practical application to the dysfunctional energy market in California and the West Instead of acting in the best interests of consumers and businesses the FERC commissioners have acted as pawns of generators and power sellers whose only interest is to plunder our economy FERCs failure to act in the interest of our consumers and businesses literally invites California to act to regain control over the energy market Given this decision California now must move forward on both legal and legislative fronts to assure stabilization generation and conservation Although we had hoped FERC would shoulder its responsibility we have not stood by idly waiting for them to rescue California Already we have taken the first steps by encouraging the construction of new generation in California The Energy Commission has approved eight new power plants since April Another is on the agenda for action next week Twentytwo more applications are pending and the Governors Green Team is working to accelerate permitting Were working closely with the California Air Resources Board and local air districts to find solutions to emissions problems Last week we were able to put megawatts of power back online to help us through the current crisis And well do more Weve refocused longidle energy conservation programs to save electricity and weve added million from the States General Fund to get conservation programs online by this summer The State under the guidance of the Secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency and the Department of Water Resources has been contributing up to megawattsaday to the conservation efforts of consumers and businesses throughout the state Large industrial users have borne a particularly heavy burden through their interruptible contracts Now in response to FERCs failure to meet its obligations I will call the California Legislature into concurrent Special Session to do at least the following Replace the socalled stakeholders on the ISO Board with Californians who are more concerned about the prices consumers and businesses pay for power than they are about the profits their companies make Reestablish the authority for the state to inspect private power plants to assure the coordination of maintenance and operating schedules Last week alone more than megawatts of power were offline with half of that in unscheduled outages Provide lowinterest financing for new peaking facilities or repowering old ones to make them cleaner and more efficient in return for committing their power to Californians at guaranteed low rates We also need to work together to conserve energy We must quickly develop programs that large industrial and commercial companies can participate in that are reasonable and predictable We must redouble our efforts to educate and involve consumers in conservation efforts that will save energy and money I will be reserving billion in my January budget for these purposes We also must ensure that there is enough electricity generation built in California to get us through the current crisis and to allow the continuing growth of our economy We need to continue the efforts started under AB through the Governors Green Team to site new generation and to repower old dirty power plants with new cleaner more efficient equipment Making a dirty power plant clean can also improve its efficiency by percent We need to explore new opportunities to produce power through the Department of Water and Power Hydroelectric power generated by the State Water Project has helped us through the crisis of the last few weeks And we need to encourage the development of cogeneration and distributed generation for businesses throughout California Finally we need to find a way to stabilize electricity rates for all Californians that does not bankrupt our utilities but at the same time keeps the pressure on the utilities and the pirate generators and power brokers to keep prices down There will be pain but everyone must share that pain A critical step to making this happen is to stop the bleeding that is occurring even today as the greed of the generators and marketeers threatens our economy Toward that end I am asking the Attorney General to expand his investigation to include civil and criminal violations that may have occurred in relation to operations practices of the generators and the pricing of natural gas This investigation should include coordination with federal authorities to determine if violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act have occurred The public health and safety of Californias citizens and the economy of the State cannot be subject to the blackmail of a few greedy privateers working in concert with a handful of Washington bureaucrats FERC has shirked its duty to the people and businesses of California I will not allow our state to be victimized by unfettered marketers I will do whatever it takes to protect the economy and security of the people of California Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy

were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday alleging three major energy companies conspired to monoploize the natural gas market in southern California and artificially increase prices and create shortages The complaints name Sempra Energy SRE and its affiliates San Diego Gas Electric Co and Southern California Gas along with El Paso Natural Gas Corp as defendants The complaint claims the companies were involved in massive conspiracy and together agreed to artificially constrict the supply of the commodity by killing natural gas pipeline projects The complaint alleges unfair competition and unlawful business practices According to the complaint top executives of SoCal Gas SDGE and El Paso Natural Gas Corp met at a Phoenix hotel in and fearing a new era of open competition and lower natural gas prices the executives gathered secretly to hatch a conspiracy to dominate the unregulated aspects of the natural gas and electricity markets At the meeting these three companies illegally agreed not to compete against each other in Southern California and Baja California natural gas delivery markets the complaint states They also conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them and lowere natural gas prices in these markets The defendants have not yet seen a copy of the complaint and were unable to comment MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Plaintiffs Seek Billions In Damages The lawsuit claims that El Paso Natural Gas and Sempra and its afilliates conspired to prevent other pipelines from being built that would have competed against them resulting in lower natural gas prices The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages The complaint alleges that in Tenneco Inc completed the Kern River Pipeline which transports natural gas from Wyoming to Kern County Calif Tenneco then began to plan for additional pipelines that would bypass SoCal Gas and SDGE pipelines and deliver gas directly to consumers in San Diego Los Angeles Imperial Valley and the Baja Peninisula One of those bypass pipelines the Altamont pipeline would have transportecd gas from Canada to the northern end of the kern River pipeline in Wyoming Tenneco envisioned that low cost Canadian gas would be carried to Southern California and Baja customers according to the complaint El Paso acquired Tenneco in June shortly before California opened up its electricity market to competition According to the complaint three months later SoCal Gas SDGE and El Paso met at the Embassy Suites Hotel near the Phoenix airport and began to hatch a conspiracy that the energy companies would eliminate Tennecos pipeline projects and continue to dominate the natural gas market via SoCal Gas being the sole bidder on the Baja pipeline SoCal Gas then allegedly agreed to refrain from competing with El Paso on a pipeline project in Mexico The transportation constraints which the conspirators created eliminate competition from Canadian gas radically drove up the price of gas and electricity and discouraged the building of new electric generation plants to serve the California market the complaint states Natural gas in California has spiked to a record per million British thermal unit last week and still hovers at around mbtu compared with a year ago Sempra Energy spokesman Art Larson said his company has not yet been served with a copy of the complaint but any claims that Sempra violated antitrust or other laws are completely false On Dec SDGE filed for emergency relief asking federal regulators to impose a price cap on natural gas transportation prices to the California border that if approved would lower costs for California gas customers Larson said Last Friday California Gov Gray Davis asked state Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether natural gas suppliers have manipulated the market in an effort to drive up prices By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires END Dow Jones Newswires GMT GMT December DJ Lawmakers Ask Justice Dept To Probe Calif PwrNatural Gas WASHINGTON Dow JonesTwo California lawmakers have asked the US Department of Justice to investigate potential collusion in the states highly volatile electricity and natural gas markets The lawmakers US Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif and John Burton president pro tempore of the California State Senate asked Attorney General Janet Reno to take immediate steps to investigate California markets for electricity and natural gas We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers the letter said The lawmakers questioned whether repairs or maintenance were truly behind why a quarter of the states generating plants werent operating in recent weeks contributing to the latest powersupply emergency in California Some have suggested that one reason for power plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market the lawmakers said The Department of Justice must act to ensure that collusion and other unlawful acts are not contributing to the crisis in Californias power markets they told Reno The probe must begin now despite the pending change in presidential administrations next month to set a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow Boxer and Burton wrote There was no immediate response from the Justice Department to the letter which was dated Friday Id be very surprised if the Justice Department found any gaming or violation of the law said Lynne Church president of the Electric Power Supply Association whose members operate deregulated power generation facilities in California Any DOJ investigation would be on top of probes already under way by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the state of California and others she said Im not too nervous about that one Church said of the prospect of DOJ joining the fray Neither the California Independent System Operator nor officials in the Pacific Northwest found any evidence of pricegouging in separate investigations they conducted Church noted Power prices skyrocketed in California because of the flawed market structure state officials imposed she said Theres no doubt those markets went higher than they would have if that structure were not in place she said But the fact that power producers made a lot of money doesnt mean they violated the law By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires END DOW JONES NEWS PM Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc

AM To cc Subject THE WINNERS IN CALIFORNIA DJ POWER POINTS Winners In Billion Calif Sweepstakes By Mark Golden A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK Dow JonesNow that PGE Corp PCG Edison International EIX and Sempra Energy SRE have announced that about billion in power costs flew out their windows this summer Wall Street might be curious to know on which corporate doorsteps the windfall landed A few of the beneficiaries have indicated publicly how well they did this summer Weve supplemented those announcements with data on market share conversations with western US electricity traders second quarter earnings reports and publicly available information from the California Independent System Operator operator of the states highvoltage transmission grid and realtime power market to create this Top list of winners in the Summer of Luck No Duke Energy Corp DUK Calpine Corp CPN and AES Corp AES These companies with significant merchant power plants in California didnt make as much money as they could have because they sold their power before prices started rising AES for starters has sold the vast majority of the capacity of its California naturalgas fired generators under a longterm fixedprice contract to make power for another company a company much higher on this list which supplies the natural gas and owns the electricity Duke with megawatts of generators in California lost out on significant potential income because it sold most of its power months before prices started to rise No Electricity trading companies These companies like Utilicorp Uniteds UCU Aquila Citizens Power now owned by Edison International and Belgian company Tractebels BTRB US unit mostly traded in and out of positions and they made good profits doing so This group also includes the unregulated trading units of Sempra and PGE No Western utilities with power to spare namely Arizona Public Service Co the Public Service Co of New Mexico PNM and IdaCorp Incs IDA Idaho Power PNM said on Sept that it made million in wholesale marketing during July and August a increase over the same two months last year Arizona Public Service which is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corp PNW had considerably more power to sell than PNM market sources said No TransAlta TTA and PPL Global PPL Western electricity prices have been high outside California as well TransAlta and PPL reached deals to buy two major coalfired power plants in the Northwest last year and took ownership before this summer Unlike gas coal is still cheap No Enron Corp ENE El Paso Energy EPG and the energy trading unit of Morgan StanleyDean Witter MWD Unlike the inandout traders these companies bet on rising prices and came into the summer holding large supplies in the West electricity traders said Enron just bought and bought and bought before the summer and never seemed to sell said one trader El Paso also owns MW of generation in California No The US Federal Government and the State of Arizona Federal utility Bonneville Power Administration and Arizona public utility Salt River Project rode to Californias rescue on the hottest days this summer providing hundreds of megawatts of supply at top dollar No Californias independent generators The merchant power companies in California that did the best this summer are Reliant Energy Inc REI with about MW of California capacity Southern Co SO with about MW NRG Energy NRG with MW and Dynegy Inc DYN with MW Unlike Duke AES and Calpine these companies held on to most of their power and sold it in the dayahead and realtime markets where prices turned out to be best Reliant has already indicated that third quarter earnings available for equity will top last years figure by about million All of these companies however saw their windfall trimmed by diversification Each owns gasfired and some oilfired merchant power plants in the eastern US where high fuel prices and low electricity prices have damped profits Weve had a good summer but we have a pretty balanced portfolio across the country Stephen Bergstrom president and chief executive of Dynegy said in an interview As good as the summer has been in the West its been as bad in the eastern half of the country No Los Angeles Dept of Water Power and its bondholders LADWP has about MW of generation or about MW more than it needs for its customers As LADWP general manager S David Freeman said a few weeks ago A blind pig could make money with that setup No The heavily taxed citizens of British Columbia Canada Their provincially owned utility BC Hydro has been very busy this summer turning free water into electricity worth hundreds of millions of dollars more than expected and flooding the provinces general funds With hydroelectric dam reservoirs the size of New England and transmission lines that can carry MW of southbound power BC Hydro has singlehandedly kept socialism solvent for another year in British Columbia And the Grand Prize winner in the California Utilities Sweepstakes Williams Companies WMB the company AESs generators are working for Williams controls almost MW of gasfired generation in the San Diego area a little more than of what Californias utilities need on average during daylight hours in the summer Whats more those plants are under contract as resource must run with the ISO Their power cant be sold in the forward market Williams had to take daily and realtime market prices by default which is exactly what you would have done to maximize profits And Williams isnt hurt by the factors that have diluted other companies California gains It isnt very exposed in the East and as a big producer of natural gas its benefiting from high gas prices nationwide Just to give an idea of how well the company likely has done this summer consider that Williams second quarter profit from its energy services segment rose to million this year from million in the second quarter of That in a quarter with one and a half months of soaring prices In the

Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Electric Power Plus Article re FERC Chairman Hoeckers Congressional Testimony Law changes needed for retroactive refunds FERCS Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Date October FERC Chairman James Hoecker D told a congressional panel that the commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against market power in a competitive environment Hoecker also urged the congressmen to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility industrys transition to competition Hoeckers plea to Congress may not be a welcomed one for California where some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this summer Although Hoecker has informed California that the commission will consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the states bulk power markets it is clear that currently the commission does not have that authority to do so retroactively The Federal Power Act would have to be changed a FERC staffer says For its own study which began in August Hoecker claimed that the commission if proven necessary would consider ordering refunds if market participants were indeed price gouging However the Federal Power Act FPA the law that gives the commission much of its authority does not consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is probably needed to see if the commission can do that If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so Hoecker told the House Committee on Government Reform Sept If market power is being exercised we will respond accordingly by revoking or modifying marketbased rates or reassuring the basis upon which we grant them We may order refunds to the extent allowed by the FPA if refunds are justified by record evidence However the FPA defines the commissions authority and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures with California and other states Currently the FPA allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions made days after the commission initiates an investigation which in this case would be Oct However the law makes no mention of retroactive ratemaking and FERC officials admit that to do so the law needs to be changed Based upon what I know the authority of the commission to issue refunds for any period before days following our investigation order is highly problematic Commissioner William Massey D told Electric Power Alert There are very good arguments that if FERC would try to do that it would be unlawful and we would need legislation to do that The Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep Dan Burton RIN held a midafternoon Sept hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a severe energy crisis this winter The committee heard testimony from Hoecker Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Carol Browner Much of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets but both Richardson and Hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast Congress for failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year Richardson expressed his disappointment that nothing passed while Hoecker claimed that FERC needs broader authority if it is to guard against market power Congress should place all electric transmission in the continental United States under the same rules for nondiscriminatory open access and comparable service Hoecker said The commissions open access rules are not binding on the part of the nations transmission system owned or controlled by entities other than public utilities Open access over the facilities of public power and other nonpublic utilities would promote greater competition in wholesale markets by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers and sellers Hoecker pointed to FERCs investigation into bulk power markets and Californias energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives clear legislative direction FERC will extremely limited in what it could do to solve the market problems Congress too has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices Hoecker said Most critically events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition Federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate investment in generation and transmission facilities and higher levels of reliability which is crucial to the digital economy The chairman also urged Congress to give FERC the authority to mandate regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability standards Currently the House is considering a bill that would make the commission a federal backstop for reliability but most congressional sources do not expect the bill to pass see related story source Electric Power Alert date October issue Vol No title FERCs Hoecker Asks Congress For Broader Authority Inside Washington Publishers

HainHOUECT on AM Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp From Ronald Carroll AM To cc Subject Fwd Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs FYI ContentTransferEncoding quotedprintable Date Tue Oct From Tracey Bradley To Deanna King Paul Fox Ronald Carroll Subject Portland Consultants Investigation Finds California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs MimeVersion ContentType textplain charsetUSASCII ContentDisposition inline FYI It sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many in the industry including by the CAISO Portland OreBased Firm Says California Has Capacity for Electricity Needs Dan McSwain North County Times Escondido Calif October Oct PORTLAND OreA private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that California had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summer The state enjoyed a percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the states power manager declared separate power emergencies because California was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigation The author of the investigations preliminary report Portlandbased economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators Thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices The Encina power plant in Carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well below its full capacity for much of June even though wholesale power prices and consumer electricity bills shot to well above the generating plants cost of production The actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the Environmental Protection Agency which monitors emissions We are seeing a lot of undergeneration McCullough said This is market power in action Market power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants in this case suppliers to influence prices Many of the industry experts present at the conference Thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts Mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the EPA Conventional explanations for the low energy production observed in San Diego County are scant Encinas operators a joint venture of energy giants Dynegy Inc and NRG Energy Inc called Cabrillo Power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems The San Diego Regional Air Quality Board said Wednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution limits But David Lloyd the corporate secretary of Cabrillo denied that the Encina plant has been used to game the San Diego County power markets That cant possibly be right Lloyd said of McCulloughs analysis In North County we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency shutdown because of heavy output Without knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off I cant comment Lloyd said We certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said We dont have that much power in California and for us to be shutting down in California to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us We want to run all we can when the prices are high Electricity prices have soared to record levels since May resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the million customers of San Diego Gas Electric Co and causing an estimated billion in losses for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric State lawmakers have intervened on behalf of San Diego County consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming IOU that could grow beyond million if high wholesale prices persist No fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected Western states The investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profits Inquiries by the California Public Utilities Commission Electricity Oversight Board and attorney general along with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation were launched in July and August Staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market data McCullough was hired in late May by the Seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the Pacific Northwest to investigate the price spikes His effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually used Chief among McCulloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the Western Systems Coordinating Council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect California to other Western states British Columbia and northern Mexico McCullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings Tuesday to the North County Times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was one of deep skepticism EPA data is notoriously unreliable said Frank Wolak a Stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the California Independent System Operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer To gauge the actual output of power plants that burn fossil fuel McCullough used emissions data from the EPA Greed would get the best of anybody Wolak said I found a lot of hours where instate generators were exceeding nameplate capacity These guys were cranking it out Wolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summer At the conference in Portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize McCulloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the Western states Low hydroelectric production in the Pacific Northwest and high temperatures in the Southwest were blamed for limiting Californias ability to import electricity Others said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supply Ron Eachus the chairman of the Oregon Public Utilities Commission said market information is routinely withheld from regulators the public and buyers of electricity but is shared among power generators and trading companies If the market is sharing it with themselves but not us I dont buy that Eachus said Tim Belden is the vice president of West Trading for Enron North America the largest marketer and trader of electricity in the world Enron takes the unique stand that more information which has been labeled proprietary by companies such as when a plant is being run and how much the electricity is selling for should be made available instantly to the markets Is there a smoking gun out there or are market participants behaving rationally Belden said California is characterized by secret black box market models that nobody understands he said If youve got nothing to hide release the data To see more of the North County Times or to subscribe to the newspaper go to c North County Times Escondido Calif

COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations Thank you for coming out here today Julee MalinowskiBall Legislative AnalystAssociate CalETCEdsonModisette Fax or

CT Christian CT Jeff CT Robert CT John M CT Greg CT Mary CT Elizabeth CT cc Subject Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Halls summary Theres some redundancy but hopefully this provides a few more details Also Mary H and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to approve the ISOs request in full Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO ISOs MWh Soft Cap a Summarized ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the MWh proposed by the FERC The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e Commissions November Order The ISOs scheduling system will not r eject Energy bids priced in excess of the MWh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order However if the ISO issues Dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the Market Clearing Price for Imbalance Energy Rather those Scheduling Coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b Refund risk and cost documentation above Imbalance Energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the Commission It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission a s well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the Commissions attention i Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the FERC See p ii Regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs However no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs In a footnote to cover letter ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or MWh whichever is lesser c Useful quote In light of current fuel prices and the ISOs recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the ISO believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an asbid basis d Effective date pm PST e Term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the Commissi on supercedes it by its own order f Applicable tariff sections Section and See attachments AB to the filing Participating Generator Penalties a Summary the ISO proposes in Amendment No to assess penalties ag ainst Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency They would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea ch hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond In addition i f during that hour the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver b Allowed excuse The penalties would not apply if the Participating Generator has notified the ISO within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its Generating Unit System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c Applicable tariff sections Amends portions of and See attachments AB to the filing d Effective date Same as the ISOs new soft cap pm PST e Term I did not see any sort of sunset provision Load Imbalance Penalties a Summary Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that market to serve t heir Loads the ISOs costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose d soft price cap or through outofmarket Dispatches when bids are insufficient Specifically those costs would be allocated to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their Demand that appears unscheduled in realtime underscheduled Load and Generation that is scheduled but does n ot appear in realtime except to the extent that the underscheduled Load or undelivered Generation is balanced within the Scheduling Coordinators portfolio The costs of dispatching units that have bid above the Mark et Clearing Price for Energy to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is

Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Eastern Interconnection These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer Enrons Federal regulatory staff Christi Charles Yeung and Sarah Novosel provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff Scott Miller who recently joined FERC from PGE Gen While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staffs recommendations the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues Importantly Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests While the Staff Hotline is used productively the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures Require TPs to retain realtime transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load internal generation to meet that load and imports and exports RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC as well as standardized criteria for curtailment In addition since even such standardized criteria might not get to the root of the problem that control area still control generation the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area Regardless of the implementation of these two options the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities it is still viewed as different with a reaction of price caps Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional costofservice model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services DETAILS Also the reports contain good summaries of the generation transmission state retail federal reg and other issues for the region Midwest The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers TPs that control transmission generation and load As such they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to thirdparties and strong incentives to favor their own services Staff received numerous complaints however due to the lack of information available from TPs Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or widespread At the very least the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access thus harming the liquidity of the market TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest with an enormous increase in The region showed a decline in peak load from to and a growth in new generation since the price spikes Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes TLRs climbed to record numbers The TLRs were highly concentrated only flowgates account for of ECAR TLRs and another flowgates in MAIN account for in that region Notably even though the NERC procedures for Level TLRs mandate transaction curtailment of the TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs OATT where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions including the propriety of TLRs TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints curtailment by fiat In addition the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the price spikes Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest Market participants must keep track of and follow a plethora of information in order to make energy deals submit reservations and provide schedules for service Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols particularly for ATC and interconnection requests and discriminatory conduct Unbelievably key data was unavailable to Staff such coincident peak load data systemwide snap shots for days when TLRs were called and importexport data This lack of data creates a market inefficiency because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time As such the market is risk adverse eschewing longterm deals for shortterm transactions Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU Staff cites Richard Tabors paper Transmission Markets Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems however all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM The result is that ATCs can be different on different sides of an interface Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staffs own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints Staff is weighing followup options The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity Staff next noted the problems with unfiled business practices especially on the next hour market Staffs audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of noncompliance Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently with equal and timely access to data including ATC CBM TRM and load flow input data TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC As a consequence the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data including current realtime network status Interconnection Issues IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support Also Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region Network service has inherent advantages over pointtopoint citing the Entergy source and sink order The Commission has relied on passively receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread there is evidence of discriminatory instances Southeast The traditional vertically integrated utility VIU model has largely persisted in the SE This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities In many cases the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices TVA despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE This is significant because of TVAs size and location IPPs have reported TVAs discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies excessive fees and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies In addition Staff cites the Florida Sup Ct decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages SE utilities reported that they have not used marketbased rates to extensively increase sales Less used than in the midwest The SE region lacks information which has retarded the Staffs efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE including ATC and TLRs Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region This appears to be justified based on Staffs investigations This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings In addition several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commissions lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits In addition the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygens request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an mile kv line that would take years to complete Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting selfbuild capacity in the incumbents territory ATC variations are a big problem in the SE SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission An improved method and improved communication are needed The SE experienced a increase in TLRs this summer This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE Staff cites information provided by Charles Y that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints In addition RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs However if control areas are retained VIUs will retain mixed incentives As noted in the Midwest report the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve Eliminating native load exceptions ie treating all load equally and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information Finally Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FPL TVA is a problem area for the Eastern Interconnect grid TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service In addition the Commission does not have full information on TVA Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing but not others to sink and park power Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential A Staff audit of FPL revealed violations of standards of conduct including confidential information on FPLs transmission system including interchange information for other entities posted on EMS systems that were available to FPLs merchant function Staffs report found that FPL does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error It is up to individual Managers discretion FRCC web site report dated Violations such as these undermine competition The reports are

and their underschedulin g in the PX day ahead market FERC had to administer the price caps for the gas industry and they cause d terrible problems list a few of FERCs nightmares FERC as reminders The Cal PX shouldnt be able to do this on a whim and indefinitly Cal PX should have to substantiate the request which they havent I SO and PX havent had the same prices as the ISO for years and they didn t have the problems described in the filing PX proposed this for political reaso ns If two parties want to agree why shouldnt PX match they hav e to be willing buyers have the ability to go to the ISO real time market Partie s should be able to buy outside of the PX we dont want to create a m onopoly for the bilateral market Recognize that the FERC may allow price caps if they do FERC should have same cap they allow for New York PJM Inconsistent wit h other markets including Canadian markets over which Commission has no jurisdiction Price cap in California is not enough to incent generation to be bui lt because it does not allow a return on an investment in generation FERC should consider allowing a cap based on the price at which interruptible load is willing to be cut Could we make the argument that capping the price in the PX will drive up the price by making participants bid up to the cap Isnt this what hap pened in California Ask for Seabron to help Protest of the EOB filing FERC should reject it Cross reference anything we said with respect to the PX filing that applies Analysis provided by Seabron Adamson of why we cant exercise mar ket power the way the EOB says we have The EOBs filing confuses bid and price caps After all who would buy in the bilateral market if they can go to the ISO and the PX get power for less Attach the joint resolution telling the ISO to show cause why it should n ot lower the price caps to MW Attach the EOB vote not to reaffirm directors Of ISO and PX If in response to the EOBs show cause order the ISO lowers prices to MW and the PX follows suit as they have indicat ed they will in their filing and as the EOB vote on their directors would forc e them California generators will stop producing because if they generate they will not be able to recover their variable costs Generators outside of California will not sell into California markets because they would not recover their variable costs and they could sell their power elsewhere and recover their variable costs Therefore the liquidity of the California market will dry up and reliability problems will occur We told you so FERC the EOB thinks they have much more power than you allowed them to have a s illustrated by their issuing orders to show cause to the ISO to lower the price cap and the EOB is now making the ISO and PX unindependent by not reaffirming Boa rd members because they wont vote for lower price caps This is ultra vi res in that the EOBs power is supposed to relate to retail jurisdiction no t setting wholesale price caps not just bid caps for the entire California market Susan J ES AM To Elsa nron Scott NRON Dennis ES Jeff CT Chris CT Robert CT Sarah NRON Mona L ES Susan J ES Joe NRON Mary CT Christi L CT James D ES Richard ES David CT Sandra

should look at this By Nigel Hunt LOS ANGELES Sept Reuters The cap on wholesale power prices in California could be cut for the third time this year this time to pe r megawatt hour after starting the year at per MWh The states Electricity Oversight Board EOB is to make a request to t he California Independent System Operator ISO within the next few days on t he issue following a resolution by the states lawmakers last week We will make a formal request within the next few days EOB Executive Director Gary Heath said An assembly joint resolution approved last week called on the EOB to direct the ISO to show cause why the price caps in the ancillary services and realtime energy markets should not be lowered to per megawattho ur immediately and continue until at least March The cap currently stands at per MWh after previous cuts from to and to amid growing consumer unrest about skyrocketing electricity bills and allegations of possible price gouging by generators The assembly resolution says the EOB should report back to the legislature by December There was heavy criticism of the ISO which controls most of the state s power grid by lawmakers this year at its governing board twice rejected resolution to cut the cap to from before finally agreeing to suc h a move Heath noted the EOB at a meeting last week decided not to approve the appointment or reappointment of members of the ISO board and members of the California Power Exchanges governing board We are trying to place people who are a bit more mindful of the implications of board decisions on Californian consumers Heath said Existing board members will remain in office until replacements can be appointed Heath said that some individuals who were rejected may eventually be approved and the EOB was rather making a statement about the performance o f the two boards The board was making a very clear statement that we are not satisfied with the the efforts of the ISO or PX governing boards to proect Californi an consumers Heath said Wholesale power prices in California soared to record levels during a heatwave in June and many customers in San Diego faced a tripling in their electricity bills Supporters of cutting the cap believe the power market is not workably competitive and prices rose to excessive levels during the heatwave putting an unfair burden on both ratepayers and shareholders of investor owned utilities Opponents have been led by independent power producers who have argued a lower cap could make it more difficult for the state to import power at times of shortage Emergency legislation signed into law by Calif Gov Gray Davis on Wednesday imposed a price cap on how much San Diego residents should pay which was less than a third of the current free market rate Customers of San Diego Gas and Electric a unit of Sempra Energy SREN had been exposed to market based prices under the terms of Californias power deregulation Rates for customers of Californias other two investor owned

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us

<12579741.1075843009190.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2000-10-26 02:42:00,Fwd PowerPlus Write Up on EPMIs White Paper on How to Fix California thanks for getting the word out PowerPlus Seeking to eliminate price caps as solution Enron Pushes FourPoint Fix To CA Wholesale Power Market Broadscale power marketer Enron on the eve of the release of a proposed FERC remedy has delivered a fourpoint plan of its own to remedy structural problems in the California wholesale power market Observers say that the power marketer is seeking to push FERC into preempting state rules with structural changes for the California market rather than continue reliance on price caps and other bidding controls as an interim solution to nascent wholesale power markets In a white paper submitted to the commission for consideration Enron tells the commissioners that the problem in California is not that competition cannot work but that it has not been given a chance to work because the existing structure of the California market is only half complete Enrons proposal developed by two experts who are intimately familiar with the California Independent System Operator CalISO suggests that FERC order four specific structural remedies Removing Barriers to Market Transparency Enron argues that the CalISO must release more information to the public in order to allow for efficient arbitrage The absence of this information is thwarting critical elements necessary for a vibrant and competitive electricity market Development of Forwards Markets and Risk Management Here Enron places some of the blame on state regulators stating that the rules established by state authorities make the wholesale market in California overly reliant on realtime and spot market supplies This has prevented the development of an adequate forwards market Virtually all observers agree that forwards markets are critical for whole market efficiency and competitiveness Enron urges FERC to preempt state policies that are interfering with the use of forwards markets by utility distribution companies On the same day that Enron filed its white paper with FERC CalISO filed a plan with the commission intended to shift power sales from the higherpriced spot market to the forward market The plan would cap generators bid prices to per megawatt hour MWh unless they offered a minimum of percent of their power for sale in the forward markets Removing Distortions on Prices That Affect Supply and Investment According to Enron generation supply and electricity demand signals are distorted in the California market Arguing against continued use of price caps Enron states unequivocally Dealing with this through continuous and increasingly severe price caps causes price discrimination and creates disincentives for the development of needed generation Enron says there are changes that can be made to the bidding process that will make the California market more efficient with undermining its longterm development through shortsighted price caps Revising CalISO and CalPX Governance Structures to Ensure Independence Enron argues that the CalISO and the California Power Exchange Corporation CalPX are governed by stakeholders that are not independent from local political forces and from the incumbent utilities that formed the basis for the ISO This conflicts with the bedrock policy of FERC Order No that ISOs must be independent Enron asserts The commission should therefore change the California ISOs board from a stakeholder board to an independent board comprised of industry experts Enron tells the commission that structural changes are needed instead of continuation of shortterm price caps and bidding controls FERC is considering whether to implement a policy of price caps and bid controls being pushed by incumbent utilities for the California market and possibly for the New York market as a solution to shaky wholesale bidding markets Power marketers are pressing hard for FERC to propose a more procompetitive solution Enron tells FERC that its proposed changes will prevent the commission from abandoning its pervasive scheme of regulation under Order No and Order No to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market as it would if it maintains perpetual price caps or worse yet it implements a return to costbased generation rates FERC is considering a proposal by the California Municipal Utilities Association for just that based on the argument that reregulation is required until more generation capacity is brought on line in California The Enron white paper comes just as FERC commissions begin to review a report by FERC staff on what went wrong in the California market last summer and a proposed remedy scheme The commission is scheduled to release the findings of the report on November along with a proposed remedy There will be a threeweek period of public review and comment before FERC makes a final decision There has been much controversy over whether FERC should release the findings of the FERC probe immediately for stakeholders to review before they comment on a proposed FERC remedy But FERC chairman James Hoecker has held hard even in the face of criticism by fellow commissioner Curt Hebert arguing that the commission needs time to review the document before releasing it

nron cc Joe NRON Subject Re Comments on FERC November order Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said ie the soft cap only applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including bilateral fwd contracts Forwarded by Steven J KeanNAEnron on AM Donna Fulton AM To Steven J nron cc Jeff NRON Joe NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard NRON Sarah NRON Susan J ES Subject Re Comments on FERC November order Just to pile on with the issues I will add a few thoughts of my own for issues that we might want to consider in our November comments Re the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO Commissioner Massey is not totally on board He specifically asked about capping the forward market He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe months and specified rate and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage of their needs from this contract A staffer Don Gelinas asked whether the forwardbilateral market presumably uncapped could take care of investment recovery so that generation not be cancelled in California Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap Specifically what is opportunity cost As long as the test is not known until after the fact there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater incentive to sell elsewhere Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not eliminate the soft cap his preferred approach that the cap should be temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues and retaining the refund liability he suggested that the refund liability be only for one month Many especially the utilities raised their position that the Commission should not institute penalties only on the load They claimed this was onesided and suggested if penalties were required they needed to be applied to the supply side as well They also argued that the load could not meet the test Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commissions encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities purchases Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation before deregulation normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of today The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include stranded costs There was almost no support for the single price auction in California The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be changed but that California had jurisdiction to change it not FERC A Court battle was threatened Steven J Kean AM To Mary CT cc Richard nron Jeff nron Susan J ES Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Paul CT Subject Re Comments on FERC November order There are a few other issues we need to look into Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements He asked if knowing this would change any of our views esp peaking plants though I suspect its already too late for that My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this exemption for bilateral transactions wont matter much but lets think it through Is EOL or APX an alternative Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments Specifically has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development In addition to any other points we might make I think we should argue that PJMing the market wont facilitate and may even hinder forward market development Also we should advocate actions by FERC that take away secondguessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here or we should take the approach I took in my testimony FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible Finally on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate Analogy if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices acquiring supplies or running the market it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized Those functions should be left to the market Mary CT AM To Steven J nron Harry nron cc Subject Comments on FERC November order Forwarded by Mary HainHOUECT on AM To Christian CT

its upcoming order FERC will lower the cap to but will not cannot order refunds By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power markets said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Last week FERC received hundreds of pages of comments to

with the price above cost analysis I drafted some specific concerns and put them into a draft to Enrons reponse to Hoeker Question Although the detail was dropped in the final draft the basic technical concerns were laid out there To really rebut JoskowKahn would take considerable work Jeff Ds idea was to write a paper that raised issues and indicated how complicated a correct response would be The JoskowKahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I am not sure Enron needs to respond to that I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over

cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily FYI In bizarre times help can sometimes come from bizarre places Granted were likely to disagree strongly with Hogans continued obsession with Poolco but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpfulIve read the Joskow paper but havent yet had a chance to review the Hogan piece Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the JoskowKahn analysis remember its Ed Kahn not Alfred Kahn Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan Co If in the end there aint nothing useful so be it But seems like theres little downside to exploring it Jim my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking too Ultimately may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow andor Hogan to come from economists rather than directly from us Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom AM To Roger illiamscom cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who could sell the same energy outside California for should bid no less than This would not be an exercise of market power

Theres some redundancy but hopefully this provides a few more details Also Mary H and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to approve the ISOs request in full Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO ISOs MWh Soft Cap a Summarized ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the MWh proposed by the FERC The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e Commissions November Order The ISOs scheduling system will not r eject Energy bids priced in excess of the MWh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order However if the ISO issues Dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the Market Clearing Price for Imbalance Energy Rather those Scheduling Coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b Refund risk and cost documentation above Imbalance Energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the Commission It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission a s well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the Commissions attention i Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the FERC See p ii Regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs However no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs In a footnote to cover letter ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or MWh whichever is lesser c Useful quote In light of current fuel prices and the ISOs recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the ISO believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an asbid basis d Effective date pm PST e Term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the Commissi on supercedes it by its own order f Applicable tariff sections Section and See attachments AB to the filing Participating Generator Penalties a Summary the ISO proposes in Amendment No to assess penalties ag ainst Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency They would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea ch hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond In addition i f during that hour the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver b Allowed excuse The penalties would not apply if the Participating Generator has notified the ISO within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its Generating Unit System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c

<19074454.1075842956856.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2000-08-30 09:44:00,Attorney Work Product Cc to propose a conference call to discuss our response to multiple FERC cases detailed below Section Proceeding and SDGE Complaint Case As you know last week the FERC established a Section proceeding to examine the justness and reasonableness of the rates of power sellers including EPMI in the California markets The Commission consolidated this proceeding with its case involving the SDGEs complaint against the power marketers including EPMI in California This type of proceeding differs from the Staffs investigation of the wholesale market in several respects It establishes a formal evidentiary process where all parties have an opportunity to present evidence and arguments on the record before the Commission In Section proceedings the FERC usually establishes a discovery and testimony schedule followed by a hearing before an administrative law judge ALJ Such proceedings usually take a long time The Commission did not establish a schedule here suggesting that it either would decide the case via a paper hearing or prompt its staff to try to settle the case The Commission may wish to act by paper hearing to obviate the slow procedural schedules that usually result from using an ALJ or as is often the case with California the FERC may wish to avoid the political backlash that might result from issuing a controversial order by letting parties fight the case out at the bargaining table after the Staff does its discovery and recommends an outcome to the parties Although the Commission equivocated on whether it would use refund authority it established a refund date of sixty days from the date the order is published in the federal register This was apparently because Commissioner Hebert wrote a concurrence indicating his opposition to instituting a refund obligation that might predate the FERCs conclusion of its investigation because it would prohibit wholesale providers from knowing what rates they will be able to recover Ron Carroll has now raised the question of whether we should request rehearing of the FERCs order challenging the Commissions authority to impose a refund effective date on the basis that no defendant has requested a refund Cal PX Price Cap Filing As you also know the California PX has filed to decrease its price cap to Electricity Oversight Board Complaint Yesterday the Electricity Oversight Boards EOB filed a complaint with FERC against sellers including munis federal power marketers and sellers located beyond the border of the United States in other words PowerEx and scheduling coordinators that sell into the California wholesale market It urges FERC to find that the California wholesale market is not workably competitive It alleges that scheduling coordinators are particularly well positioned to take advantage of gaming opportunities because they often bid on behalf of more than one seller undermining the benefits of divestiture It alleges that sellers and SCs can exercise market power under two circumstances When all sellers and scheduling coordinators know with substantial certainty that the ISO will be accepting all bids or When a number of sellers and scheduling coordinators know that they control enough capacity in relation to the system demand at that time and the resulting margin of residual supply that they have a high likelihood of being able to successfully set the price It claims that once demand reaches or exceeds approximately MW sellers andor scheduling coordinators have the ability and do exercise market power and that a bid cap is necessary during these periods It urges FERC to take immediate steps to lower prices and ensure the bid caps of for energy and ancillary services and for replacement reserves remain in effect pending FERC action EOB is concerned that if the FERC doesnt require continuation of price caps the ISO could undo its price cap vote at any time It asks FERC to take any and all actions necessary to ensure that Californias wholesale rates are just and reasonable Its asks to consolidate its filing into the FERCs section proceeding Assuming the FERC consolidates this cases which Im sure it will this would create a defendant for refund purposes so I think Rons rehearing idea has been overtaken by events However we need to decide what entities should make what filings in reference to the above I recommend the following EPMI doesnt need to intervene in the Section proceeding because the FERC combined it with the SDGE case so EPMI is already a party I think we should use Seabron to develop a detailed analysis of problems with the California market and to draft responses to the data requests that we will undoubtedly be receiving soon from FERC This analysis should include the points we presented to FERC but should also include all other important problems with the California wholesale market We are parties of right in the Electricity Oversight Boards case because we are respondents and as such we are required to file an answer under the Commissions rules I think we should agree that the FERC should consolidate this case with the Section case because they are obviously the same case We should oppose price caps in California and lay out the same arguments we made in our presentation to FERC We also need to refute the contention that capping the PX price will encourage energy sales to move into the forward market We will also need to develop an analysis of how we cant exercise market power under the circumstances alleged by the EOB We should use Seabron for this Although it would be convenient to work with EPSA in these dockets Im not sure that will work since I bet the FERC will combine these cases and will be seeking discovery individually from EPMI On the other hand we may wish to use EPSA for any of the less popular messages that we may want to deliver about the market in California Lysa Please set up a conference call about this ASAP

Seeking to eliminate price caps as solution Enron Pushes FourPoint Fix To CA Wholesale Power Market Broadscale power marketer Enron on the eve of the release of a proposed FERC remedy has delivered a fourpoint plan of its own to remedy structural problems in the California wholesale power market Observers say that the power marketer is seeking to push FERC into preempting state rules with structural changes for the California market rather than continue reliance on price caps and other bidding controls as an interim solution to nascent wholesale power markets In a white paper submitted to the commission for consideration Enron tells the commissioners that the problem in California is not that competition cannot work but that it has not been given a chance to work because the existing structure of the California market is only half complete Enrons proposal developed by two experts who are intimately familiar with the California Independent System Operator CalISO suggests that FERC order four specific structural remedies Removing Barriers to Market Transparency Enron argues that the CalISO must release more information to the public in order to allow for efficient arbitrage The absence of this information is thwarting critical elements necessary for a vibrant and competitive electricity market Development of Forwards Markets and Risk Management Here Enron places some of the blame on state regulators stating that the rules established by state authorities make the wholesale market in California overly reliant on realtime and spot market supplies This has prevented the development of an adequate forwards market Virtually all observers agree that forwards markets are critical for whole market efficiency and competitiveness Enron urges FERC to preempt state policies that are interfering with the use of forwards markets by utility distribution companies On the same day that Enron filed its white paper with FERC CalISO filed a plan with the commission intended to shift power sales from the higherpriced spot market to the forward market The plan would cap generators bid prices to per megawatt hour MWh unless they offered a minimum of percent of their power for sale in the forward markets Removing Distortions on Prices That Affect Supply and Investment According to Enron generation supply and electricity demand signals are distorted in the California market Arguing against continued use of price caps Enron states unequivocally Dealing with this through continuous and increasingly severe price caps causes price discrimination and creates disincentives for the development of needed generation Enron says there are changes that can be made to the bidding process that will make the California market more efficient with undermining its longterm development through shortsighted price caps Revising CalISO and CalPX Governance Structures to Ensure Independence Enron argues that the CalISO and the California Power Exchange Corporation CalPX are governed by stakeholders that are not independent from local political forces and from the incumbent utilities that formed the basis for the ISO This conflicts with the bedrock policy of FERC Order No that ISOs must be independent Enron asserts The commission should therefore change the California ISOs board from a stakeholder board to an independent board comprised of industry experts Enron tells the commission that structural changes are needed instead of continuation of shortterm price caps and bidding controls FERC is considering whether to implement a policy of price caps and bid controls being pushed by incumbent utilities for the California market and possibly for the New York market as a solution to shaky wholesale bidding markets Power marketers are pressing hard for FERC to propose a more procompetitive solution Enron tells FERC that its proposed changes will prevent the commission from abandoning its pervasive scheme of regulation under Order No and Order No to increase competition in the wholesale electricity market as it would if it maintains perpetual price caps or worse yet it implements a return to costbased generation rates FERC is considering a proposal by the California Municipal Utilities Association for just that based on the argument that reregulation is required until more generation capacity is brought on line in California The Enron white paper comes just as FERC commissions begin to review a report by FERC staff on what went wrong in the California market last summer and a proposed remedy scheme The commission is scheduled to release the findings of the report on November along with a proposed remedy There will be a threeweek period of public review and comment before FERC makes a final decision There has been much controversy over whether FERC should release the findings of the FERC probe immediately for stakeholders to review before they comment on a proposed FERC remedy But FERC chairman James Hoecker has held hard even in the face of criticism by fellow commissioner Curt Hebert arguing that the commission needs time to review the document before releasing it

<31210331.1075843097922.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,mary.hain@enron.com,2000-08-30 09:44:00,Attorney Work Product Cc to propose a conference call to discuss our response to multiple FERC cases detailed below Section Proceeding and SDGE Complaint Case As you know last week the FERC established a Section proceeding to examine the justness and reasonableness of the rates of power sellers including EPMI in the California markets The Commission consolidated this proceeding with its case involving the SDGEs complaint against the power marketers including EPMI in California This type of proceeding differs from the Staffs investigation of the wholesale market in several respects It establishes a formal evidentiary process where all parties have an opportunity to present evidence and arguments on the record before the Commission In Section proceedings the FERC usually establishes a discovery and testimony schedule followed by a hearing before an administrative law judge ALJ Such proceedings usually take a long time The Commission did not establish a schedule here suggesting that it either would decide the case via a paper hearing or prompt its staff to try to settle the case The Commission may wish to act by paper hearing to obviate the slow procedural schedules that usually result from using an ALJ or as is often the case with California the FERC may wish to avoid the political backlash that might result from issuing a controversial order by letting parties fight the case out at the bargaining table after the Staff does its discovery and recommends an outcome to the parties Although the Commission equivocated on whether it would use refund authority it established a refund date of sixty days from the date the order is published in the federal register This was apparently because Commissioner Hebert wrote a concurrence indicating his opposition to instituting a refund obligation that might predate the FERCs conclusion of its investigation because it would prohibit wholesale providers from knowing what rates they will be able to recover Ron Carroll has now raised the question of whether we should request rehearing of the FERCs order challenging the Commissions authority to impose a refund effective date on the basis that no defendant has requested a refund Cal PX Price Cap Filing As you also know the California PX has filed to decrease its price cap to Electricity Oversight Board Complaint Yesterday the Electricity Oversight Boards EOB filed a complaint with FERC against sellers including munis federal power marketers and sellers located beyond the border of the United States in other words PowerEx and scheduling coordinators that sell into the California wholesale market It urges FERC to find that the California wholesale market is not workably competitive It alleges that scheduling coordinators are particularly well positioned to take advantage of gaming opportunities because they often bid on behalf of more than one seller undermining the benefits of divestiture It alleges that sellers and SCs can exercise market power under two circumstances When all sellers and scheduling coordinators know with substantial certainty that the ISO will be accepting all bids or When a number of sellers and scheduling coordinators know that they control enough capacity in relation to the system demand at that time and the resulting margin of residual supply that they have a high likelihood of being able to successfully set the price It claims that once demand reaches or exceeds approximately MW sellers andor scheduling coordinators have the ability and do exercise market power and that a bid cap is necessary during these periods It urges FERC to take immediate steps to lower prices and ensure the bid caps of for energy and ancillary services and for replacement reserves remain in effect pending FERC action EOB is concerned that if the FERC doesnt require continuation of price caps the ISO could undo its price cap vote at any time It asks FERC to take any and all actions necessary to ensure that Californias wholesale rates are just and reasonable Its asks to consolidate its filing into the FERCs section proceeding Assuming the FERC consolidates this cases which Im sure it will this would create a defendant for refund purposes so I think Rons rehearing idea has been overtaken by events However we need to decide what entities should make what filings in reference to the above I recommend the following EPMI doesnt need to intervene in the Section proceeding because the FERC combined it with the SDGE case so EPMI is already a party I think we should use Seabron to develop a detailed analysis of problems with the California market and to draft responses to the data requests that we will undoubtedly be receiving soon from FERC This analysis should include the points we presented to FERC but should also include all other important problems with the California wholesale market We are parties of right in the Electricity Oversight Boards case because we are respondents and as such we are required to file an answer under the Commissions rules I think we should agree that the FERC should consolidate this case with the Section case because they are obviously the same case We should oppose price caps in California and lay out the same arguments we made in our presentation to FERC We also need to refute the contention that capping the PX price will encourage energy sales to move into the forward market We will also need to develop an analysis of how we cant exercise market power under the circumstances alleged by the EOB We should use Seabron for this Although it would be convenient to work with EPSA in these dockets Im not sure that will work since I bet the FERC will combine these cases and will be seeking discovery individually from EPMI On the other hand we may wish to use EPSA for any of the less popular messages that we may want to deliver about the market in California Lysa Please set up a conference call about this ASAP

nron cc Joe NRON Subject Re Comments on FERC November order Has anyone talked with Tim B about what Larcamp said ie the soft cap only applies to PX and ISO bids and not to any bilateral contracts including bilateral fwd contracts Forwarded by Steven J KeanNAEnron on AM Donna Fulton AM To Steven J nron cc Jeff NRON Joe NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard NRON Sarah NRON Susan J ES Subject Re Comments on FERC November order Just to pile on with the issues I will add a few thoughts of my own for issues that we might want to consider in our November comments Re the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO Commissioner Massey is not totally on board He specifically asked about capping the forward market He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe months and specified rate and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage of their needs from this contract A staffer Don Gelinas asked whether the forwardbilateral market presumably uncapped could take care of investment recovery so that generation not be cancelled in California Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap Specifically what is opportunity cost As long as the test is not known until after the fact there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater incentive to sell elsewhere Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not eliminate the soft cap his preferred approach that the cap should be temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues and retaining the refund liability he suggested that the refund liability be only for one month Many especially the utilities raised their position that the Commission should not institute penalties only on the load They claimed this was onesided and suggested if penalties were required they needed to be applied to the supply side as well They also argued that the load could not meet the test Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commissions encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities purchases Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation before deregulation normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of today The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include stranded costs There was almost no support for the single price auction in California The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be changed but that California had jurisdiction to change it not FERC A Court battle was threatened Steven J Kean AM To Mary CT cc Richard nron Jeff nron Susan J ES Joe NRON Sarah NRON Donna NRON Paul CT Subject Re Comments on FERC November order There are a few other issues we need to look into Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements He asked if knowing this would change any of our views esp peaking plants though I suspect its already too late for that My gut reaction is that so long as the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this exemption for bilateral transactions wont matter much but lets think it through Is EOL or APX an alternative Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments Specifically has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market development In addition to any other points we might make I think we should argue that PJMing the market wont facilitate and may even hinder forward market development Also we should advocate actions by FERC that take away secondguessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about contracting forward We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps We need to think through whether there is something we can live with here or we should take the approach I took in my testimony FERC should encourage the state to provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those requirements up for bid ie get the utility out of the commodity business as much as possible Finally on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate Analogy if the ISO is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in retaining the most technically competent people not hiring or appointing their lackies or friends So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices acquiring supplies or running the market it is destined to be controversial and highly politicized Those functions should be left to the market Mary CT AM To Steven J nron Harry nron cc Subject Comments on FERC November order Forwarded by Mary HainHOUECT on AM To Christian CT

its upcoming order FERC will lower the cap to but will not cannot order refunds By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will likely lower its proposed per megawatthour soft cap on Californias wholesale power prices to MWh in its final order to repair the states troubled electricity market commissioners said Monday But the commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires they wont order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits earned last summer as a result of spiking power prices in the state despite pleas from state lawmakers and Gov Gray Davis because they lack the authority to do so We still believe we cannot order refunds one FERC commissioner said If there was an inch in the Federal Power Act that gave us the authority we would take it But that would destroy the future of deregulation FERC released a report earlier this month that largely pinned Californias ongoing power crisis on the structure of the states wholesale electricity markets The commission also issued a proposed order requiring changes needed to make the market workably competitive The order found that electricity prices in the state rose to unjust and unreasonable levels last summer But FERC fell short of ordering refunds saying it lacked the legal authority to do so Instead FERC proposed changes to the governing boards of the states two wholesalemarket operators the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange said the states three investorowned utilities should no longer be required to buy a majority of their power from the CalPX and proposed penalties for utilities that put off buying the power they need until the last minute FERC also proposed capping the price paid to all bidders in Californias power auctions at MWh Individual bidders could still get higher prices but would have to justify their claims to FERC FERC may issue its final order as early as Dec and commissioners said California shouldnt expect it to differ from the proposed changes recommended by FERC earlier this month The comment period for FERCs draft order closed Nov MORE Dow Jones Newswires GMT Final Order Wont Order Refunds Davis warned FERC commissioners at a public hearing in San Diego two weeks ago that a failure to order refunds would produce a ratepayer revolt Your proposed solution to our energy crisis does nothing to lower prices for California consumers the Democratic governor told FERC on Nov at a meeting in San Diego Quite to the contrary it is designed to bring our economy and our consumers to their knees Californias power regulators and utilities also pressed for refunds The states Public Utilities Commission said it has evidence of market abuse by generators and that consumers were overcharged billion last summer for electricity Edison International unit EIX Southern California Edison in its response to the FERC order attached a study by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who found considerable evidence generators and power marketers deliberately withheld supply from California from June through September when power usage is at its peak to drive up wholesale prices But despite the allegations FERC commissioners said they will not order refunds though they said the state could legally return to costbased rates One commissioner also warned a lower soft cap of MWh would likely deter generators from building new power plants in the state even as it limited price spikes The truth of the matter is there is no painless or easy way for California to change its electricity market the FERC commissioner said Consumer Groups Push Ballot Measure To Reregulate Davis will file the changes the state wants made to the proposed order with FERC on Friday but FERC commissioners said they dont expect to be swayed by the governors filing Meanwhile Californians are steaming ahead with their own solutions On Tuesday the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights a Southern California consumer advocacy group will hold a news conference announcing its own sweeping changes to the states power market which it will try to implement through a proposed ballot measure the details of which have not been disclosed Furthermore state lawmakers plan on rewriting parts of AB Californias landmark restructuring law when the state Legislature convenes next year There is already heated debate within the Legislature to reauthorize utilities to build power plants and to create a public utility system like Nebraskas where there are no investorowned utilities in an effort to control power prices California lawmakers want to be reelected in one key lawmaker close to the electricity issue said And Davis is in meetings to replace the CalISO and CalPX with a new entity to manage the power grid and the states two wholesale power markets said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary By Jason Leopold Dow Jones Newswires Last week FERC received hundreds of pages of comments to

technical concerns were laid out there To really rebut JoskowKahn would take considerable work Jeff Ds idea was to write a paper that raised issues and indicated how complicated a correct response would be The JoskowKahn withholding section has recieved criticism from the ISO so I am not sure Enron needs to respond to that I think my bottom line now is that the debate at FERC will soon be over

discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpfulIve read the Joskow paper but havent yet had a chance to review the Hogan piece Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the JoskowKahn analysis remember its Ed Kahn not Alfred Kahn Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan Co If in the end there aint nothing useful so be it But seems like theres little downside to exploring it Jim my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking too Ultimately may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow andor Hogan to come from economists rather than directly from us Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom AM To Roger illiamscom cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who could sell the same energy outside California for should bid no less than This would not be an exercise of market power

Theres some redundancy but hopefully this provides a few more details Also Mary H and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to approve the ISOs request in full Bullet Summary of the ISOs Amendment No December Filing The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO ISOs MWh Soft Cap a Summarized ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the MWh proposed by the FERC The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e Commissions November Order The ISOs scheduling system will not r eject Energy bids priced in excess of the MWh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order However if the ISO issues Dispatch instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the Market Clearing Price for Imbalance Energy Rather those Scheduling Coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b Refund risk and cost documentation above Imbalance Energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the Commission It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission a s well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the Commissions attention i Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the FERC See p ii Regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs However no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs In a footnote to cover letter ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or MWh whichever is lesser c Useful quote In light of current fuel prices and the ISOs recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the ISO believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an asbid basis d Effective date pm PST e Term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the Commissi on supercedes it by its own order f Applicable tariff sections Section and See attachments AB to the filing Participating Generator Penalties a Summary the ISO proposes in Amendment No to assess penalties ag ainst Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency They would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea ch hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond In addition i f during that hour the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver b Allowed excuse The penalties would not apply if the Participating Generator has notified the ISO within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its Generating Unit System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c

overlap between the P X filing and the EOB filing Sorry this is so rough Protest of PX filing FERC should reject the PXs price caps because Energy Markets are competitive in the West loads and sellers Say what we and EPSA said in San Diego case and say that high prices are not due to exercise of market power they are the product of scarcity and t he failure of the IOUs to hedge in the forward market and their underschedulin g in the PX day ahead market FERC had to administer the price caps for the gas industry and they cause d terrible problems list a few of FERCs nightmares FERC as reminders The Cal PX shouldnt be able to do this on a whim and indefinitly Cal PX should have to substantiate the request which they havent I SO and PX havent had the same prices as the ISO for years and they didn t have the problems described in the filing PX proposed this for political reaso ns If two parties want to agree why shouldnt PX match they hav e to be willing buyers have the ability to go to the ISO real time market Partie s should be able to buy outside of the PX we dont want to create a m onopoly for the bilateral market Recognize that the FERC may allow price caps if they do FERC should have same cap they allow for New York PJM Inconsistent wit h other markets including Canadian markets over which Commission has no jurisdiction Price cap in California is not enough to incent generation to be bui lt because it does not allow a return on an investment in generation FERC should consider allowing a cap based on the price at which interruptible load is willing to be cut Could we make the argument that capping the price in the PX will drive up the price by making participants bid up to the cap Isnt this what hap pened in California Ask for Seabron to help Protest of the EOB filing FERC should reject it Cross reference anything we said with respect to the PX filing that applies Analysis provided by Seabron Adamson of why we cant exercise mar ket power the way the EOB says we have The EOBs filing confuses bid and price caps After all who would buy in the bilateral market if they can go to the ISO and the PX get power for less Attach the joint resolution telling the ISO to show cause why it should n ot lower the price caps to MW Attach the EOB vote not to reaffirm directors Of ISO and PX If in response to the EOBs show cause order the ISO lowers prices to MW and the PX follows suit as they have indicat ed they will in their filing and as the EOB vote on their directors would forc e them California generators will stop producing because if they generate they will not be able to recover their variable costs Generators outside of California will not sell into California markets because they would not recover their variable costs and they could sell their power elsewhere and recover their variable costs Therefore the liquidity of the California market will dry up and reliability problems will occur We told you so FERC the EOB thinks they have much more power than you allowed them to have a s illustrated by their issuing orders to show cause to the ISO to lower the price cap and the EOB is now making the ISO and PX unindependent by not reaffirming Boa rd members because they wont vote for lower price caps This is ultra vi res in that the EOBs power is supposed to relate to retail jurisdiction no t setting wholesale price caps not just bid caps for the

should look at this By Nigel Hunt LOS ANGELES Sept Reuters The cap on wholesale power prices in California could be cut for the third time this year this time to pe r megawatt hour after starting the year at per MWh The states Electricity Oversight Board EOB is to make a request to t he California Independent System Operator ISO within the next few days on t he issue following a resolution by the states lawmakers last week We will make a formal request within the next few days EOB Executive Director Gary Heath said An assembly joint resolution approved last week called on the EOB to direct the ISO to show cause why the price caps in the ancillary services and realtime energy markets should not be lowered to per megawattho ur immediately and continue until at least March The cap currently stands at per MWh after previous cuts from to and to amid growing consumer unrest about skyrocketing electricity bills and allegations of possible price gouging by generators The assembly resolution says the EOB should report back to the legislature by December There was heavy criticism of the ISO which controls most of the state s power grid by lawmakers this year at its governing board twice rejected resolution to cut the cap to from before finally agreeing to suc h a move Heath noted the EOB at a meeting last week decided not to approve the appointment or reappointment of members of the ISO board and members of the California Power Exchanges governing board We are trying to place people who are a bit more mindful of the implications of board decisions on Californian consumers Heath said Existing board members will remain in office until replacements can be appointed Heath said that some individuals who were rejected may eventually be approved and the EOB was rather making a statement about the performance o f the two boards The board was making a very clear statement that we are not satisfied with the the efforts of the ISO or PX governing boards to proect Californi an consumers Heath said Wholesale power prices in California soared to record levels during a heatwave in June and many customers in San Diego faced a tripling in their electricity bills Supporters of cutting the cap believe the power market is not workably competitive and prices rose to excessive levels during the heatwave putting an unfair burden on both ratepayers and shareholders of investor owned utilities Opponents have been led by independent power producers who have argued a lower cap could make it more difficult for the state to import power at times of shortage Emergency legislation signed into law by Calif Gov Gray Davis on Wednesday imposed a price cap on how much San Diego residents should pay which was less than a third of the current free market rate Customers of San Diego Gas and Electric a unit of Sempra Energy SREN had been exposed to market based prices under the terms of Californias power deregulation Rates for customers of Californias other two investor owned

transmission with the ISO is the lack of public information Tim wants all ISO information as he says more better faster In other words he wants meter and outage information water levels bids and schedules actual flows transmission availability and congestion Making this information available is necessary for three reasons This information would help the market to police itself and provide better price signals producing a more efficient market It would remove competitive advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large percentage of the generation in the market It would also as Sue points out remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the grandfathered transmission contract holders Susan J ES PM To Steven J NRON cc Jeff ES Mona L ES Tim NRON Mary NRON Paul NRON Richard ES James D ES Subject Re ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS OK Ill take a shot in answering your questions Steve Others are free to comment as well The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened If you talk to the traders they LOVE it Before April they had no sales to CA Now they have millions of dollars of sales Why no transmission access to speak of before the ISO took over We still have some problems however The problems have been there since day one and FERC has punted on them We have a huge FERC case dealing with many of them We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path probably at least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it The traders have also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path So what are the access issues Path is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA Has been for years The transmission fix is basically adding a third intertie line between Tracy and Tesla When I left PGE in the estimated coast was million The congestion costs did not justify building the line then PGE continues to control Path and tells the ISO whats left after PGE allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes There is no transparency PGE has the ability to use Path to advantage Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts Carl has looked into it somewhat and doesnt think PGE is but The ISO says it cant interpret PGEs contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about how its some kind of overseer we protested and have now appealed The munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One their contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights more like interruptible but once the ISO started all of a sudden the muni rights became super firm superceding the IOU rights as far as we can tell from sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff Thats why we have pushed the issue Also Dynegy and Power Exchange not the PX have rights on Path Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is being operated Information in general is pretty sketchy on realtime transmission We have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows whats going on in transmission as do the utilities changes what it does which then changes prices and then doesnt tell us until after the fact The ISO has promised to do better but I dont think has implemented any real changes yet Advantageous access Except for whats going on in Path I dont think the IOUs have any advantages on access except with respect to Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear and hydro but I think its resource specific rather than owner specific The munis are another story See next item Munis Preference This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country In making a devils bargain with the munis the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable situation The sanctity of contracts under any and all conditions has created preference for incumbents not the IOUs but everyone who had a transmission contract with the IOUs and poor rights for those poor schlepps like us who have come into the new market The ISO cannot operate the system this way and is forced to give the munisDynegy more than they had originally and to let them do things no one else can do eg some munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins some get to do it every half hour so far most havent had to pay for ancillary services etc There are many many examples of how we are discriminated against in addition to Path and of how FERC has shined us on but yet we fight on The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the new transmission charge for CA into this has been entangled the rules for munis joining the ISO The munis want huge handouts to join And part of the new T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis Ive pointed out that this amounts to the IOUs customers paying for the munis stranded transmission costs when they are already paying for the IOUs stranded generation costs but this argument fell on deaf ears in the ISO Its really not our issue but it does make you kind of sick about where public policy stands in this state Feel free to call Steven J NRON AM Sent by Steven J NRON To Jeff ES Susan J ES Mona L ES Tim CT Mary CT cc Paul CT Richard ES James D ES Subject When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge We have stayed away from transmission issues on the assumption that California with its ISO and PX does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the country Is this true Does Californias system layer in priorities for utility use of the system eg doesnt PGE control path Does that control provide advantageous access to PGE Are there other examples and are there links between these preferences and the current problems in California As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us
