<5686434.1075840551619.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,vireturn@uts.cc.utexas.edu,2002-01-15 06:19:05,COME EARLY BE LOUD STAY LATEPST Please do not respond to this email using the REPLY function If you have comments or suggestions about the content email Trey McLean at tEXas tailgatES talk The bowls are over and now the second season begins recruiting Recruiting is its own entity with its own characteristics For example can you think of another instance where grown men feverishly talk on the Internet about year olds Well I mean one that doesnt include jail time People will spend several hundred dollars in the next weeks on subscriptions to recruiting sites so they can be the st to tell their friends that Billy Ray Shasta from Cut N Shoot TX is now considering Texas and LSU instead of just Miami or that the Aggies have a guy who is really instead of and they padded his stats Its extraordinary if you think about it Adults with jobs spouses kids and such stressing over where a teenager theyve never met from a town theyve never been to is thinking about going to school next fall Have you heard of anything more absurd Lets move on to the bowl games because I heard Billy Ray might actually be instead of and could commit today so I have to get logged in Wow What else can you say Wow That was one for the ages folks Like I said Washington cant run right One more reason to ignore me The Horns fall behind early rally for the lead get blown out in the nd and rd quarter only to storm back and win at the buzzer Unbelievable Saint Major played lights out in the th and that is good since he did not in the st half interceptions for a touchdown Yikes Had Simms done that some of you would have gone over the wall after him noose firmly in hand Glad you held off on Major since he rallied the team Quick sidenote Chris Simms was NOT laughing at Applewhite on the interception for a touchdown It is the job of the freshman quarterback to chart every play called and what the outcome of that play is This is harder than it looks because the charter does not have the benefit of a replay or commentary to fall back on only his eyes Naturally these frosh will sometimes get behind as was the case that Friday in San Diego Matt Nordgren was at times to plays behind and begging for help from Simms and Chance Mock who repeatedly laughed him off The upperclassmen told the true freshman to tough it out as they had to do when it was their turn The problem was since he was behind he was writing during the current play and spent the entire st half asking the other what just happened When Applewhite was picked off Nordgren ran up to Simms and Mock and asked what had happened AGAIN and they BOTH busted up as did or other players who were standing close by and it got caught on tape THAT IS ALL No one on the team was upset no coaches nothing Simms was not bitter he was not slouching he does not have an attitude problem he was not unprepared Nothing could be further from the truth Anything else you hear is rubbish The game was actually games in one heres what I mean The st quarter was all defense with neither team able to score as both missed field goals The nd quarter was highlighted by turnovers three by the Longhorns Applewhite was picked off times in possessions one leading to a field goal and the other returned yards for a touchdown by a guy who had been in plays all season Huskies Texas answered with a yard bomb from Major to BJ Johnson and Vasher picked off UDub on the next series and Applewhite found Roy Williams on a yard pass for another touchdown Longhorns The Huskies answered with a yard drive to take the lead again Huskies Applewhite was picked again as time was running out in the half and Washington got another field goal out of it and went in at half up by with all of the points coming in the nd Huskies The rd quarter was brutal As I sat in the stands I really thought that the Horns had quit to tell you the truth Washington rb Willie Hurst was cutting the defense to shreds and hey Somebody cover that tight end They seemed flat and listless and I was wondering if they really were still carrying that CU game around with them The Huskies could do no wrong scoring tds on long drives with relative ease and the Longhorns matched that with field goals Texas was down at one point before hitting another field goal at the end of the rd Huskies The th quarter was maybe the most exciting and thrilling quarter of Texas football that I can remember The team seemed to come out of the fog and wake up The offense drove yards and cut the lead to on Matt Trissels yard touchdown reception yes Matt Trissel but Texas missed the point conversion Huskies The defense needed a spark and a stop and they got both with Bam Bam Derrick Johnson made the tackle on the ensuing kickoff stopped the running play up the middle for no gain on st down broke up a pass on nd down and had the tide turning momentum shifting play of the game on rd down DJ came clean on a blitz and didnt exactly sack the quarterback as much as he ran over him planting him on his back about yards behind the line of scrimmage and will be forever known to me as The Hit This happened in the endzone in front of all of the Texas fans and it ignited the crowd Texas took over at their and Roy Williams bailed out Applewhite on the next play when he went up between defenders and snagged an illadvised pass before getting creamed at the It was the best catch Ive seen Roy make this year Big Ivan who I think realized this game that he is got his st td of the night Huskies The Hit seemed to rattle Washington on the next series and they looked out of sorts on st and nd down On rd down Pickett tried to force a pass into te Jeramy Stevens but Cory Redding tipped it it bounced off of him and Stevens before DJ came up huge AGAIN and picked it off at the and took it back to the Applewhite hit Scaife on rd and goal from the for the lead with to play Longhorns Texas held UDub to and out and tried to run out the clock but no dice Washington took over with to play and promptly went right through the Horns and on rd and from the Texas Willie Hurst went off tackle and untouched for a touchdown much to the horror of Texas fans leaving to play Huskies I really made an effort to watch the bench after that score They didnt look down They were all clapping and jumping around very upbeat You got the impression from the bench that it wasnt a matter of if but when Applewhite hit Johnson for yards up to midfield on a beautiful timing play that had Major throwing the ball before BJ even broke plays later same play other side Applewhite connected with Johnson for yards to the Husky This time BJ made an over the shoulder catch Willie Mays style Awesome Back to the ITrain to close the deal as Williams carried on the next two plays scoring from the with seconds to play Longhorns UW took over near midfield but the defense held and the game was over Easy enough huh I have never seen anything like that before I am glad I was there to see it person Spring PracticeOutlook Mack Brown has announced spring practice will begin February with the annual Orange and White game set for March No time has been set on the game and these dates are subject to change The Texas Exes will have an open house the day of the Spring Game more than likely just like regular game days in the fall I will be sending another email the week before that and give you all of the details about the game start time what time we open here etc and a preview of what to expect and look for I will also break down the recruiting class depth chart schedule and prognosis for the fall Heres the Cliffs Notes version for now The outlook for is pretty good if you ask me Do not underestimate what Winning that game in San Diego will do for the confidence and psyche of this team They got over a hump this year the win hump and look for that to do wonders for them Confidence is everything in sports It took Nebraskas Tom Osborne years to win a title then he wins in a row and NU won another in and played for it in Same thing with Bobby Bowden years at FSU with nothing and then since the Seminoles won it in he has won it once more and played for it more times Texas hasnt won anything yet but they are on the right track A better comparison would be Virginia Tech The Hokies were invisible before and then they beat Texas in the Sugar Bowl and have not looked back They are a perrenial top team and they EXPECT to win every game Texas is there now Texas must replace starters offense defense but that sounds tougher than it is in my opinion offensive linemen are gone but there is a pool of to choose from Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway split time at starting guard this year so both are considered returning starters will slide to the other side to replace KirkHughes Beau Baker got significant time at center before his injury and can hardly be considered inexperienced if he wins the job left by Anderson The linebackers all graduate but the leading tackler on the team is Derrick Johnson who will start wherever he wants in the linebacking corps The soph will be all Big XII next year Reid Boyd played in every game at lb last year and will got the nod at one spot as well Lee Jackson will return from turf toe to fight for the rd spot and he started for years at ss before his injury Dakari Pearson will take the safety spot left by Ahmad Brooks Dak started at the same position in So what youre looking at is filling a void left at tackle and corner not easy but not as uphill as you st thought right The biggest challenge next year is the schedule The Horns go to UNC KState Nebraska and Tech A Crouchless Nebraska a crippled KState and no freaks on the dl at Carolina Peppers and Simms Again not easy but the hill isnt as step as it looks News and Notes I just like saying it It like that too The Horns finish in the top for the st time since Its the st time since theyve done it by winning their way in lost the bowl game to drop to Texas set several school bowl game records Most points Maryland Sun Bowl Total offense yds Tennessee Cotton Bowl Most passing yards Pitt Bluebonnet Bowl The point deficit is the greatest comeback in Texas football history beating the previous mark of OU Roy Williams and BJ Johnson set a Texas bowl record by being the st Texas receiving duo to have a yard reception day in the same game Roy had catches for yards and BJ had for each had a touchdown Washington running back Willie Hurst had yards rushing for the season He had yards on carries in the Holiday Bowl thats yards per carry Those are Play Station stats Husky te Jeramy Stevens had catches for yards and a touchdown I think they all came on the same drive The Longhorns only had penalty in the game Around the Conference The Big XII went in bowl games heres how they went Rose Bowl Miami Nebraska Yep Pretty much like I thought I said Miami would have won the NFC East by Thanksgiving In hindsight I gave to much credit to the rest of the NFC East Fiesta Bowl Oregon Colorado Colorados running game vs Mike Belottis brain The brain wins hand down Goes to show you can beat anybody when they turn the ball over right Buffs Cotton Bowl OU Arkansas Dont make me watch this sort of thing again Fox Ive seen shuffleboard at retirement homes more exciting than this New Land Thief Offensive Coordinator Chuck Long said he was going to open things up Belated Christmas presents dont count Chuck Alamo Bowl Iowa Texas Tech What Wheres all the offense Mike points There were a total of field goals in the game Fantastic Leach is pushing Red Raider qb Kliff Kingsbury for the Heisman in I dont anybody ever won it as a holder did they Insightcom Bowl Syracuse Kansas St I told you to look for the tell tale sign for the Wildcats blowout win or close loss Well secret option C blowout loss They quit this year and if they dont regroup quick will not be pretty Independence Bowl Alabama Iowa St This went as I thought I am a big proponent of the Cylcones They missed a field goal that would have won it at the end If they find a New running back they could be trouble in GalleryFurniturecom Bowl AM TCU Yeah The Aggies found a secondary bad enough to torch and a team with an offense worse than their own It was close until the rd when the Ags pulled away Dozens cheered them on More News Coach Bob flirted with Florida to get himself a huge raise Mack Brown also got a raise but the Acres can afford it OU Athletic Director Joe Castiglione said the Sooners could not go over mil per year because their department already runs in the red Well they went over WAY over Coach Bob got point guard money when OU came up with mil over years Now the Sooners have to slash budgets campus wide and jack up their ticket prices Why didnt you ask for a pony too Coach Bob Im sure basketball coach Kelvin Sampson will be more than accommodating when his contract is up next season and he gets nothing a year Mike Martz coach of the soon to be Super Bowl Champion St Louis Rams wants a hefty raise to bring his salary up to million per Management said NO WAY I guess OU knows something St Louis doesnt Roy Williams of OU went pro Good Go terrorize NFL teams and leave us alone Thats it Its been fun this season I will sign off until March when youll get the preview for the Spring Game depth chart and season to come I will talk to you all in a few weeks Hookem Trey McLean Texas Exes
