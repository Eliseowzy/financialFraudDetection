Remarketing Agreement Section Fees and Expenses provides that the Remarketing Agent will not be entitled to any compensation or reimbursement for expenses in connection with its services under the Agreement but UBS Warburg andor affiliates of the bank are presumably receiving various fees eg structuring underwriting or placement fees etc and to the extent the affiliate is foreign and its employees are performing those services in the US we could have a withholding tax issue with respect to those fees Can we get an itemization of the fees that Enron expects to pay in the deal and the status ie foreign or domestic of the intended recipients Section c If there is the potential for the remarketed notes to be issued in bearer form are we sure that Enron will have the necessary rights to design the notes and monitor the marketing process so as to ensure we dont lose our interest deduction and that we dont become subject to withholding for payments to foreign holders Trust Agreement Section Definition of Opinion of Counsel page The second sentence in this definition which describing that published rulings from the IRS can be relied upon in an an opinion from counsel on tax matters seems awkward Are items not listed here offlimits for reliance I would propose to delete the sentence entirely Section a page a Will the Trust actually be created at the time the Certificateholders make their investment or will it be created earlier and then be amended and restated at the time the Certificateholders make their appearance If the latter is true who will initially hold all the beneficial interests in the Trust eg Enron or a third party and if the latter whether it is foreign or domestic b Are there any restrictions on the number of Certificateholders either initially or at any subsequent time If not can we be sure that the Trust will not treated as a publicly traded partnership for tax purposes Sections and pages We should confirm that the The Bank of New York as Trustee will actually be responsible for any tax reporting that needs to ge done in connection with the trust eg trust information return Form or in connection with the certificate holders ownership interest in the trust Forms INT interest and Form foreign currency swap payments andor Forms S if the offering becomes a Regulation S offering I have found in the past that even when documents specify that a bank or trust company is supposed to handle these duties they are typically either ill equipped or physically incapable of complying See also Section To the extent that Enron is required to handle any of the book accounting tax accountingreporting and any other daytoday activitites for the Trust we need to determine whether that would give the certificate holders nexus in Texas for purposes of the Texas franchise tax We should also check to make sure that the reference to Enron in the name of the Trust doesnt affect this analysis especially since Enron is apparently responsible for paying the expenses and liabilities of the Trust under Section the Trustees fees under Section a and is responsible for indemnification of the Trustee the Paying Agent and the Certificate Registrar under Section b Purchase Agreement Section page What kind of discounted purchase price will be paid for the Notes first by the Trust and then by the Initial Purchaser Presumably the amount will be de minimis but we need to know for purposes of doing an original issue discount OID calculation Section page We need to know if and when it is determined that the Certificates will
