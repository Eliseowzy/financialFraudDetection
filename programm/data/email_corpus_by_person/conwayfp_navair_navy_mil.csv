want Unless youre really pushing it you wont notice much of a difference However what you will notice is that the cyl will be working a lot harder ie louder Once you jump into the youre in the luxury market and you probably want a smoother car with plenty of torque cyl Especially the way you drive not winding the engine out in every gear youll feel more low end power in the Again it comes down to the pax If youre hauling most of the time the is probably fine hauling it will be sucking wind a bit Remember when youre on a test drive the car isnt configured the way it will be in real life The tires will be under inflated the gas tank large in that car like gal pounds and no passengers so your performance will seem better My best advice when looking at cars in that price range is to insist on an extended overnight or over a weekend test drive of both You dont want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of weeks later Finally think about long term kids etc if you plan on hanging onto it as long as the Miata Its not uncommon for a bimmer to go miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a while if you stay up on the maintenance Give me a buzz at home

Sent Thursday October AM To Conway Frank P Subject RE I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory section It was one of the most disappointing games ive ever attended the astros dont even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play the managers an idiot intentionally walking Bonds with guys on st and nd with outs Anyway in terms of the Miata the dealer recommended abt worth of work Of course i told him to just get the thing running The problem is the blue book value is only so i cant see putting another grand into it Ill probably just sell it to someone who races miatas which is really big in Texas or donate it to charity and take the tax write off We havent test driven anything yet but it looks like were leaning toward the BMW i It seems to get great reviews the main downside is that its a little small but still sporty Well go for test drives this weekend and should buy or lease still undecided something in the next couple weeks Hows everything on your
