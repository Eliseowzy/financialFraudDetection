<15206745.1075857851325.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,owner-nyiso_tech_exchange@lists.thebiz.net,2000-11-27 00:22:00,Re Environmental Concerns about Emergency ProgramsThanks very much for your observations in response to my environmenta l memo I think I understand some of your concerns about the role of the ISO in general and in particular with regard to conservation programs There are several ways in which I think the NYISO is inextricably involved with energy efficiency The current competitive market the NYISO is overseeing is quite simply not working when it comes to demand or load responding to prices Supply or generators are responding to priceimperfectly but there is significant response So we have half a market We should be seeking to put demand on a par with supplytreating load equally with generation We are moving in the direction of facilitating that but with basically all consumers on fl at or average rates and with almost all LSEs the regulated distribution companies able to pass along their energy costs there is little basis fo r responding to high prices even when we have the software mechanisms in pla ce to do so Someone needs to find a way to have consumers confronting real pricesor at least paying a risk premium for not having to do so Someo ne needs to find a way to have LSEs have a financial incentive to keep prices downthey dont now One way LSEs could do so would be to encourage their fixed price customers through incentives to reduce their use when pric es are high Environmentally there is a lot at stake in getting the market t o work right and the ISO plays a major role in that even when it is not it s immediate responsibility The emergency measures the ISO is considering have very significant environmental impacts Small diesel generators may be needed to avoid the significant social costs of outages One environmental concern here is that such generators be restricted to emergency conditions and not become a new breed of economic peak clippers And also it seems reasonable that the emergency program clean up after itself by having offsets or mitigation associated with it Actual demand reductions are a preferable alternative since they do not have health and environmental impactsand help lower market prices at the same time I dont mean to suggest that the NYISO is responsible for all of the iss ues raised hereclearly the PSC DEC NYSERDA and others have very important roles I think the NYISO needs to work with these other agencies to get competition to work more or less right and pull down prices and protect t he environment at the same time Sorry if I have fallen into the trap of repeating myselfat length Than ks for your comments Larry

Participants Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted on the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement statements The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software necessary to update and or correct the prices associated with the categories listed below Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below the NYISO will recompute and post new real time weighted files Information on what intervals have been changed as a result of a specific issue noted below will be provided Issue Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a Reserve Pickup request the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup RPU period is the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval preceding the reserve pickup interval There were limited instances during the first months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and posted for the reserve pickup intervals Solution Issue For the period until the present all RPU intervals that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle immediately preceding the reserve pickup Any modifications made which result in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the rebill and trueup process in future months Issue Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices During the process of correcting and reposting prices the Generator or proxy bus prices were updated but not the Zonal or load prices Solution Issue ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their corresponding zonal prices will be copied into the zonal bus prices to overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files as these should be identical NOTE The Billing Accounting System BAS was coded to use the generator proxy bus price Therefore the BAS calculations have been consistent with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills Issue Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS Due to Loss of Communications At times there periods exist when communication links between operating systems namely SCD and Performance Tracking PTS in this case have failed and have to be manually reactivated During these subsystem failure periods SCD intervals are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price correction process the SCD intervals are restored During these failure periods the SCD StartStop signals are not being transferred to the PTS Sixsecond actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods PTS develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods During the failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval observations The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a match between the price file and the metered MW files For example if SCD had intervals for and and the PTS integrated actuals covered the period then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent sets of data The interval then becomes a minute interval Solution Issue The system will be programmed such that it will recognize when an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by splitting the large interval with the assumption that the energy was delivered uniformly over the entire interval Retroactive to Nov the missing intervals will be created Through the monthly rebill and trueup process these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result Issue Dispatch Interval Type R When SCD is in a reserve pickup and the pickup is unsuccessful after minutes an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and sent to generators At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS an LBMP interval is also sent These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then ignored in BAS Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov all LBMP intervals generated as part of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted In the future the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting Issue Consistent Updated Price Postings Prior to January intervals updated as part of price corrections were posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format thus making it difficult for market participants to locate the correct data Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov an update of the current LBMP posting files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally posted The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price posting discrepancies and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov

Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw External Proxy Bus Prices During Transmission Constraints ECA B reissuance of ECA B Thank you for the presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance Unit and the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with the Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw in the RealTime energy markets concerning external proxy bus prices during transmission limitation periods I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous support to the NYISO to reissue ECA B until the Market Participants can consider and approve and the NYISO can implement a tariff change required to permanently address the Market Design Flaw As stated in my Memorandum to you of October I agreed with your conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a Market Design Flaw as defined in Attachment Q to the ISO OATT Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities the TEPs As further stated in that Memorandum I agreed with your analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw would absent appropriate action remain different from what would otherwise occur during periods of efficient competition I have now determined based on consultations with ISO Staff and the support of the Business Issues Committee that it is appropriate to maintain in effect the corrective measures adopted as ECA B while consultation and cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is ongoing to develop and implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance with the ISO Agreement Please reissue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action ECA and post it on the OASIS for implementation effective at the expiration of ECA B The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety days William J Museler President and CEO New York Independent System Operator cc Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action B Market Design Flaw Regarding RealTime External Proxy Bus Prices Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply when the following two conditions are met Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus and The Balancing Market Evaluation BME resolves transmission congestion constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour resulting in transmission congestion charges in the HourAhead Market HAM Rationale When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus and the total proposed transactions exceed the available transfer capacity BME will resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental bid price or the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants proposing the transactions In the operating hour the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the External Proxy Bus are fixed and SCD is not required to resolve for transmission congestion costs associated with the scheduled transactions Therefore in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is binding RealTime prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different from the HAM prices due to the absence of transmission congestion costs being reflected in the RealTime price Currently scheduled HAM transactions at an External Proxy Bus are settled at the RealTime price at the External Proxy Bus during the operating hour and the import transactions receive a Bid Production Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and RealTime price The Market Design Flaw in the current process is that transmission congestion constraints present when BME schedules HAM transactions are not reflected in the RealTime settlement prices Under the rules set forth below the transmission congestion costs present in BME will be reflected in the SCD prices so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be charged the full cost of supplying that transaction up to the decremental bid cost or sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participant at the time the HAM transaction was proposed Implementation Rules These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus EPB by a transmission limitation or Desired Network Interchange DNI limit an EPB Limit For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the greater of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus Issued December pm Effective January Operating Hour Beginning

Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action A Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply to Import and export transactions that are scheduled for an operating hour in the HourAhead Market HAM by the Balancing Market Evaluation BME and that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market Participant or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant Wheelthrough transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export transaction and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of both financial impacts as provided below This ECA shall not apply to import export or wheelthrough transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or action or neighboring control area operator error or action Rationale Import Transactions During the HAM resolution BME reduces commitments for energy resources within NYCA to accept scheduled import transactions at a specific proxy bus indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled import transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be elevated above the HAM price due to the failed import transaction The difference between the realtime price and the BME price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the realtime market Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction Export Transactions During the HAM resolution BME makes commitments for energy resources to supply scheduled export transactions up to the purchase price indicated by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus Where the scheduled export transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to the failed export transaction The difference between the BME price and the realtime price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part of Schedule costs Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction WheelThrough Transactions During the HAM resolution BME includes scheduled wheelthrough transactions up to the transmission congestion cost that equals the decremental bid indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled wheelthrough transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at both the import and export proxy busses may be elevated or depressed respectively due to the effects on transmission congestion of the failed wheelthrough transaction Under this ECA the effects of the import and export portions of the failed wheelthrough transaction will be calculated separately as though they were separate

your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs I will include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April th NYISO Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT project Initially this project was viewed as a quick hit which could be completed swiftly at minimal cost and with minimal impact on staff and ongoing project work Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the case Question on CITCSS In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is either my misunderstanding or conflicting information provided by NY and PJM I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items I will also make a similar request of PJM Common interface tool My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do this entirely or almost entirely on their own and just allocate some costs between NY and PJM The product as I understood it would be available to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling The users would input to the tool and NY and PJM would basically get screenedcoordinated input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout problems etc If this was the case I dont understand the comments at the BIC that NY wont be able to do this by the summer Is this a PJM or NY constraint Is PJM unable to complete what they offered I can understand that that would hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work However at the PJM EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go could make the schedule and just needed NY agreement If this is a NY constraint I would also like to know more about it Can you please clarify what is going on here Response Reported by Mr Museler to the MC on There have been recent developments in the NYISO PJM CIT process At the present time no software requirements document has been created no vendor contracts have been signed and a number of issues including ensuring the confidentiality of data providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM based system fails and liability all have to be resolved When the project was originally proposed the NYISO believed it could be done quickly with a limited amount of resources This has not proven to be the case Completing this project immediately would take resources away from other projects need for Summer and will have a budget impact of approximately million The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project to come ahead of the Summer issues or to proceed without vendor contracts in place and other outstanding issues resolved The NYISO will continue work on the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments Question Inter ISO Congestion Pilot I was disappointed in the lukewarm presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC I realize that this program is very limited in scope but it seems to me this is a very important precedent to the future coordination of the ISOs As we left things it seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer However I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick said He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey At first blush this got a very negative response in the group Then I started to think about this more My understanding is the basic structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as redispatch to ease a constraint in A Thus if PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation presumably this was to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint Now I am not a great electrical engineer but my limited understanding of the systems suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY through the PSEG cable Is this correct IF CORRECT DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REDISPATCH IN PJM I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion otherwise we have some big problems I would appreciate a further explanation of this as perhaps I dont understand what is physically happening Thanks for the help Response With regard to the interISO Congestion management pilot Rick Gonzales offers the following response to your comments Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Interregional Congestion Pilot program The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential implementation of this program One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for costshifting between ISOs In addition to providing a list of candidate operational constraints it was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to redispatch its internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints This concept is in agreement with your understanding that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as redispatch to ease a constraint in A Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Interregional Congestion Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting C King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to SENY and the operation of the PARs Waldwick LindenGoethalsHudson faragut Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets the full capability of the HudsonFarragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure The equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the MayJune period In preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service NYISO and PJM staff have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR schedules to the PSEGCon Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long been associated with this equipment It would be premature to establish a congestionmanagement pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of the PARs until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs is fully discussed and agreed to Both PJM NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto earlier this year so this is nothing new Presently the equipment owners PSEG Con Edison as well as NYISO and PJM are engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating agreement between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs Progress is being made thus I think that every effort is being made to insure that energy can flow between PJM and SENY and between NY and New Jersey for this summer and beyond We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast See you in Springfield next Wednesday Chuck

the clarification regardless of what triggers mitigation it is still an automated process that bypasses due process System unit and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to determine market power are dynamic you would assume that they are fixed Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of the system As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity that is not even taken into consideration Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as an example MMbtu who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly basis If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see that would be set by an internal generator Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the Market Mitigation Plan The default reference price for a generators energy is based on recently accepted bids for energy from that generator In the event that such data are unavailable a default reference price is either by negotiation with the generator or by an estimate of cost What defines an accepted bid Is it the dispatch of a generator with payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is higher This is not clear to me What happened to the negotiation part In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery part of those costs are fixed cost recovery None of the default reference bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs Thanks Joe Original Message From Mark Younger mailto Sent Saturday April AM To Subject RE Automatic Mitigation Mark Younger writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding The price is the lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any mitigation This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed The price will not trigger mitigation in and of its Whenever one of the zones has a price that is above the AMP will run to determine if any units have crossed the conduct threshold If there are any units that have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact threshold has been triggered If the impact threshold is triggered in any zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated ie reference bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold If the impact threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be used Original Message From mailto On Behalf Of Kirkpatrick Joe Sent Saturday April AM To Cc Subject Automatic Mitigation Kirkpatrick Joe writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List The NYISO has chosen as representative of a level to trigger market mitigation I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of A increase or an increase of is coincidently the same price I am questioning the determination of this price and its application in the market mitigation plan In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic withholding How does the price reference a specific unit I am not sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire statewide price and then compare it to a generators bid If a generators fuel costs without fixed cost recovery is that unit would presumably never bid below its cost it would always bid as a minimum How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified in the market mitigation plan A increase would be and an increase of would be and yet using the AMP interpretation of the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding is It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market Mitigation Plan The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not The simple question would be is the threshold representative of every generators bid to determine economic withholding The answer can only be no how can it be The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator was exercising market power The determination of whether a generator was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all of the prevalent market unit and system conditions to determine if that unit was in fact exercising market power The more complex the system the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised How does a price trigger or any automatic threshold take all of the complexities of a situation into account It cannot I suspect that is why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power determination The full facts are presented and evaluated every case is unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high as a result of market power A better solution would be to delay the prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made In the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they should be held in reserve for determination of market power Prices can be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power at least then due process can be followed Market participants can be consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is required for market power evaluation The AMP is still in place but is only used to identify potential market power until a human evaluation is done Joe

ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected

NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Mark Thank you for your thoughtful response I think you raise some valid points but I do not think they change the end conclusion Fundamental Value of ICAP The principle of the ICAP market as in any market should be to reflect the value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market The question is whether the product being sold in this case ICAP has truly appreciated more then since the previous ICAP auctions Maybe but I doubt it AMP and Expected Revenue The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis although plausible seems fairly weak It presumes that generation owners were planning on violating the preexisting screens and counting on the revenue from those golden eggs Likewise the link between expected energy revenue and ICAP prices is tenuous at best Generators are not limited to receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market In either case the goal of the generation owner is to maximize revenue through all markets The ICAP market if functioning properly should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external transactions from that generator For example two generation owners owned two plants with the same characteristics One generation owner did a relatively good job selling a forward energy contract for the month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively poor job selling a similar contract In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same strategy maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the ICAP auction Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to overall lower profits Price Cap Load Bidding I wont comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place because it isnt going to be Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past only know it is expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding This is not a significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the underlying value of the ICAP product significant uncertainty to the New York market I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal made it difficult for generation owners to properly evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a month market For this reason as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter I believe that mitigating measures should be evaluated I am not passing judgment at this stage but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may be required to some or all of the months Next Steps If the MMU determines that there was economic and or physical withholding whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP I believe that it is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for longer term resolution Stephen Fernands Consultant AES NewEnergy Original Message From Mark Younger To Tech Team EMail List Sent Wednesday May PM Subject FW NYISO MC Document from Stephen Fernands to MC Members Steve Fernands comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures Second he also uses the results of this summers stripmonthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the ICAP market Because the entire ICAP requirement is not cleared in a single auction the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal ICAP providers The

NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List I wont repeat everything that Mark said I agree with all of it I publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies for upcoming ICAP However it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental change in the ICAP markets This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a call on the resource When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no energy price cap or effectively the price cap was today it is This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered last summer with a strike price of versus today An order of magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major to me particularly when coupled with

Discussion List The MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources that would fall within the DEC cap Any SCR resource that is exempt should not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP I never meant to imply they should As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply it seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not comply with the DECs wishes We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC Original Message From Aaron Breidenbaugh mailto Sent Saturday May PM To Mark Younger Cc PRLWG Larry DeWitt PACE jdprunkl Tech Team EMail List Subject Re mW DEC Cap for Emergency Exempt for EDRP We can flesh this discussion out next week but from the outset Marks and Roys comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive First of all not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap Many will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State Facility status either of which allows then to operate above the MW cap Lacking any DECimposed limit all such permitted facilities must be allowed to sign up for full SCR value Obviously other SCR resources not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and cannot be limited Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating Units CDEPGs as John Prunkl points out it is ISO Operations staff that will need to decide on a realtime basis which SCR units should be called Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls a unit called one day may or may not be needed the next Only in the case where there will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then as with generators there is no guarantee that all SCRcertified units will be there when called upon The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR but to decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during emergencies SCR resources that get signed up but cannot be called due to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP but cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee limitations I think this would mean a UCAP hit for future sales As a more fundamental matter I do not believe that DECs illadvised MW limit which was not agreed to by the NYISO is currently enforceable as a practical matter Only the NYISO knows when the MW cap is being approached and therefore the ISOs failure to adhere to that limit should not be held against the affected generators Nevertheless the DEC ruling appears to revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that the NYISO has violated the MW limit The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO which does not hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC If NYISO agrees to abide by the MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do so I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed Consider the following NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where the lights would go out in New York City with MW of CDEPGs but could stay on with MW I believe that the ISO operators might have no choice but to order the MW on and preserve reliability notwithstanding the DEC limitation By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which they have literally no knowledge let alone control DECs action currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State Facility Permits The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad assurances in SOASapproved Operating Manuals that operations staff can NEVER call on more than MW of CDEPGs at any given time Even then it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status revoked CDEPGs may be forced to seek realtime certifications from the NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed the MW limit I would be interested in the ISOs opinion on whether it can and will limit activations of CDEPGs to less than MW no matter what the circumstances Aaron Mark Younger wrote If only MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers The purpose of ICAP is to assure that

proxy bus prices during transmission limitation periods I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous support to the NYISO to reissue ECA B until the Market Participants can consider

conduct identified at that time constituted a Market Design Flaw as defined in Attachment Q to the ISO OATT Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities the TEPs As further stated in that Memorandum I agreed with your analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw would absent appropriate action remain

effective at the expiration of ECA B The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety days William J Museler President and CEO New York Independent System Operator cc Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action B Market Design Flaw Regarding RealTime External Proxy Bus Prices Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply when the following two conditions are met Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus and The Balancing Market Evaluation BME resolves transmission congestion constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour resulting in transmission congestion charges in the HourAhead Market HAM Rationale When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus and the total proposed transactions exceed the available transfer capacity BME will resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental bid price or the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants proposing the transactions In the operating hour the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the External Proxy Bus are fixed and SCD is not required to resolve for transmission congestion costs associated with the scheduled transactions Therefore in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is binding RealTime prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different from the HAM prices due to the absence of transmission congestion costs being reflected in the RealTime price Currently scheduled HAM transactions at an External Proxy Bus are settled at the RealTime price at the External Proxy Bus during the operating hour and the import transactions receive a Bid Production Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and RealTime price The Market Design Flaw in the current process is that transmission congestion constraints present when BME schedules HAM transactions are not reflected in the RealTime settlement prices Under the rules set forth below the transmission congestion costs present in BME will be reflected in the SCD prices so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be charged the full cost of supplying that transaction up to the decremental bid cost or sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participant at the time the HAM transaction was proposed Implementation Rules These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus EPB by a transmission limitation or Desired Network Interchange DNI limit an EPB Limit For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the greater of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus Issued December pm Effective January Operating Hour Beginning

Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action A Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply to Import and export transactions that are scheduled for an operating hour in the HourAhead Market HAM by the Balancing Market Evaluation BME and that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market Participant or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant Wheelthrough transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export transaction and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of both financial impacts as provided below This ECA shall not apply to import export or wheelthrough transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or action or neighboring control area operator error or action Rationale Import Transactions During the HAM resolution BME reduces commitments for energy resources within NYCA to accept scheduled import transactions at a specific proxy bus indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled import transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be elevated above the HAM price due to the failed import transaction The difference between the realtime price and the BME price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the realtime market Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction Export Transactions During the HAM resolution BME makes commitments for energy resources to supply scheduled export transactions up to the purchase price indicated by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus Where the scheduled export transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to the failed export transaction The difference between the BME price and the realtime price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part of Schedule costs Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction WheelThrough Transactions During the HAM resolution BME includes scheduled wheelthrough transactions up to the transmission congestion cost that equals the decremental bid indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled wheelthrough transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at both the import and export proxy busses may be elevated or depressed respectively due to the effects on transmission congestion of the failed wheelthrough transaction Under this ECA the effects of the import and export portions of the failed wheelthrough transaction will be calculated separately as though they were separate failed transactions The sum of those impacts shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed wheelthrough transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction Implementation Rules An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is delivered to the NYCA in realtime will be settled by the scheduling entity selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the scheduling entitys BME Bid Price and buying the energy that was not delivered from the LBMP Market at the RealTime LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy Generator Bus No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is shown that the

for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is received from NYCA in realtime will be settled by the scheduling entity buying the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling entitys BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP Market at the RealTime LBMP at the

your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs I will include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April th NYISO Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT project Initially this project was viewed as a quick hit which could be completed swiftly at minimal cost and with minimal impact on staff and ongoing project work Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the case Question on CITCSS In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is either my misunderstanding or conflicting information provided by NY and PJM I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items I will also make a similar request of PJM Common interface tool My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do this entirely or almost entirely on their own and just allocate some costs between NY and PJM The product as I understood it would be available to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling The users would input to the tool and NY and PJM would basically get screenedcoordinated input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout problems etc If this was the case I dont understand the comments at the BIC that NY wont be able to do this by the summer Is this a PJM or NY constraint Is PJM unable to complete what they offered I can understand that that would hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work However at the PJM EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go could make the schedule and just needed NY agreement If this is a NY constraint I would also like to know more about it Can you please clarify what is going on here Response Reported by Mr Museler to the MC on There have been recent developments in the NYISO PJM CIT process At the present time no software requirements document has been created no vendor contracts have been signed and a number of issues including ensuring the confidentiality of data providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM based system fails and liability all have to be resolved When the project was originally proposed the NYISO believed it could be done quickly with a limited amount of resources This has not proven to be the case Completing this project immediately would take resources away from other projects need for Summer and will have a budget impact of approximately million The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project to come ahead of the Summer issues or to proceed without vendor contracts in place and other outstanding issues resolved The NYISO will continue work on the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments Question Inter ISO Congestion Pilot I was disappointed in the lukewarm presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC I realize that this program is very limited in scope but it seems to me this is a very important precedent to the future coordination of the ISOs As we left things it seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer However I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick said He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey At first blush this got a very negative response in the group Then I started to think about this more My understanding is the basic structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as redispatch to ease a constraint in A Thus if PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation presumably this was to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint Now I am not a great electrical engineer but my limited understanding of the systems suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY through the PSEG cable Is this correct IF CORRECT DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REDISPATCH IN PJM I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion otherwise we have some big problems I would appreciate a further explanation of this as perhaps I dont understand what is physically happening Thanks for the help Response With regard to the interISO Congestion management pilot Rick Gonzales offers the following response to your comments Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Interregional Congestion Pilot program The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential implementation of this program One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for costshifting between ISOs In addition to providing a list of candidate operational constraints it was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to redispatch its internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints This concept is in agreement with your understanding that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B is taking an action such as redispatch to ease a constraint in A Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Interregional Congestion Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting C King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to SENY and the operation of the PARs Waldwick LindenGoethalsHudson faragut Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets the full capability of the HudsonFarragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure The equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the MayJune period In preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service NYISO and PJM staff have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR schedules to the PSEGCon Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long been associated with this equipment It would be premature to establish a congestionmanagement pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of the PARs until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs is fully discussed and agreed to Both PJM NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto earlier this year so this is nothing new Presently the equipment owners PSEG Con Edison as well as NYISO and PJM are engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating agreement between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs Progress is being made thus I think that every effort is being made to insure that energy can flow between PJM and SENY and between NY and New Jersey for this summer and beyond We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast See you in Springfield next Wednesday Chuck

the clarification regardless of what triggers mitigation it is still an automated process that bypasses due process System unit and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to determine market power are dynamic you would assume that they are fixed Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of the system As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity that is not even taken into consideration Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as an example MMbtu who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly basis If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see that would be set by an internal generator Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the Market Mitigation Plan The default reference price for a generators energy is based on recently accepted bids for energy from that generator In the event that such data are unavailable a default reference price is either by negotiation with the generator or by an estimate of cost What defines an accepted bid Is it the dispatch of a generator with payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is higher This is not clear to me What happened to the negotiation part In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery part of those costs are fixed cost recovery None of the default reference bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs Thanks Joe Original Message From Mark Younger mailto Sent Saturday April AM To Subject RE Automatic Mitigation Mark Younger writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding The price is the lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any mitigation This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed The price will not trigger mitigation in and of its Whenever one of the zones has a price that is above the AMP will run to determine if any units have crossed the conduct threshold If there are any units that have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact threshold has been triggered If the impact threshold is triggered in any zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated ie reference bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold If the impact threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be used Original Message From mailto On Behalf Of Kirkpatrick Joe Sent Saturday April AM To Cc Subject Automatic Mitigation Kirkpatrick Joe writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List The NYISO has chosen as representative of a level to trigger market mitigation I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of A increase or an increase of is coincidently the same price I am questioning the determination of this price and its application in the market mitigation plan In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic withholding How does the price reference a specific unit I am not sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire statewide price and then compare it to a generators bid If a generators fuel costs without fixed cost recovery is that unit would presumably never bid below its cost it would always bid as a minimum How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified in the market mitigation plan A increase would be and an increase of would be and yet using the AMP interpretation of the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding is It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market Mitigation Plan The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not The simple question would be is the threshold representative of every generators bid to determine economic withholding The answer can only be no how can it be The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator was exercising market power The determination of whether a generator was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all of the prevalent market unit and system conditions to determine if that unit was in fact exercising market power The more complex the system the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised How does a price trigger or any automatic threshold take all of the complexities of a situation into account It cannot I suspect that is why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power determination The full facts are presented and evaluated every case is unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high as a result of market power A better solution would be to delay the prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made In the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they should be held in reserve for determination of market power Prices can be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power at least then due process can be followed Market participants can be consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is required for market power evaluation The AMP is still in place but is only used to identify potential market power until a human evaluation is done Joe

ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected

NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Mark Thank you for your thoughtful response I think you raise some valid points but I do not think they change the end conclusion Fundamental Value of ICAP The principle of the ICAP market as in any market should be to reflect the value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market The question is whether the product being sold in this case ICAP has truly appreciated more then since the previous ICAP auctions Maybe but I doubt it AMP and Expected Revenue The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis although plausible seems fairly weak It presumes that generation owners were planning on violating the preexisting screens and counting on the revenue from those golden eggs Likewise the link between expected energy revenue and ICAP prices is tenuous at best Generators are not limited to receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market In either case the goal of the generation owner is to maximize revenue through all markets The ICAP market if functioning properly should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external transactions from that generator For example two generation owners owned two plants with the same characteristics One generation owner did a relatively good job selling a forward energy contract for the month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively poor job selling a similar contract In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same strategy maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the ICAP auction Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to overall lower profits Price Cap Load Bidding I wont comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place because it isnt going to be Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past only know it is expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding This is not a significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the underlying value of the ICAP product significant uncertainty to the New York market I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal made it difficult for generation owners to properly evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a month market For this reason as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter I believe that mitigating measures should be evaluated I am not passing judgment at this stage but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may be required to some or all of the months Next Steps If the MMU determines that there was economic and or physical withholding whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP I believe that it is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for longer term resolution Stephen Fernands Consultant AES NewEnergy Original Message From Mark Younger To Tech Team EMail List Sent Wednesday May PM Subject FW NYISO MC Document from Stephen Fernands to MC Members Steve Fernands comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures Second he also uses the results of this summers stripmonthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the ICAP market Because the entire ICAP requirement is not cleared in a single auction the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal ICAP providers The

NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List I wont repeat everything that Mark said I agree with all of it I publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies for upcoming ICAP However it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental change in the ICAP markets This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a call on the resource When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no energy price cap or effectively the price cap was today it is This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered last summer with a strike price of versus today An order of magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major to me particularly when coupled with

Discussion List The MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources that would fall within the DEC cap Any SCR resource that is exempt should not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP I never meant to imply they should As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply it seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not comply with the DECs wishes We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC Original Message From Aaron Breidenbaugh mailto Sent Saturday May PM To Mark Younger Cc PRLWG Larry DeWitt PACE jdprunkl Tech Team EMail List Subject Re mW DEC Cap for Emergency Exempt for EDRP We can flesh this discussion out next week but from the outset Marks and Roys comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive First of all not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap Many will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State Facility status either of which allows then to operate above the MW cap Lacking any DECimposed limit all such permitted facilities must be allowed to sign up for full SCR value Obviously other SCR resources not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and cannot be limited Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating Units CDEPGs as John Prunkl points out it is ISO Operations staff that will need to decide on a realtime basis which SCR units should be called Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls a unit called one day may or may not be needed the next Only in the case where there will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then as with generators there is no guarantee that all SCRcertified units will be there when called upon The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR but to decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during emergencies SCR resources that get signed up but cannot be called due to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP but cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee limitations I think this would mean a UCAP hit for future sales As a more fundamental matter I do not believe that DECs illadvised MW limit which was not agreed to by the NYISO is currently enforceable as a practical matter Only the NYISO knows when the MW cap is being approached and therefore the ISOs failure to adhere to that limit should not be held against the affected generators Nevertheless the DEC ruling appears to revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that the NYISO has violated the MW limit The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO which does not hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC If NYISO agrees to abide by the MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do so I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed Consider the following NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where the lights would go out in New York City with MW of CDEPGs but could stay on with MW I believe that the ISO operators might have no choice but to order the MW on and preserve reliability notwithstanding the DEC limitation By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which they have literally no knowledge let alone control DECs action currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State Facility Permits The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad assurances in SOASapproved Operating Manuals that operations staff can NEVER call on more than MW of CDEPGs at any given time Even then it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status revoked CDEPGs may be forced to seek realtime certifications from the NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed the MW limit I would be interested in the ISOs opinion on whether it can and will limit activations of CDEPGs to less than MW no matter what the circumstances Aaron Mark Younger wrote If only MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers The purpose of ICAP is to assure that

Market Participants Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted on the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement statements The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software necessary to update and or correct the prices associated with the categories listed below Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below the NYISO will recompute and post new real time weighted files Information on what intervals have been changed as a result of a specific issue noted below will be provided Issue Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a Reserve Pickup request the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup RPU period is the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval preceding the reserve pickup interval There were limited instances during the first months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and posted for the reserve pickup intervals Solution Issue For the period until the present all RPU intervals that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle immediately preceding the reserve pickup Any modifications made which result in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the rebill and trueup process in future months Issue Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices During the process of correcting and reposting prices the Generator or proxy bus prices were updated but not the Zonal or load prices Solution Issue ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their corresponding zonal prices will be copied into the zonal bus prices to overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files as these should be identical NOTE The Billing Accounting System BAS was coded to use the generator proxy bus price Therefore the BAS calculations have been consistent with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills Issue Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS Due to Loss of Communications At times there periods exist when communication links between operating systems namely SCD and Performance Tracking PTS in this case have failed and have to be manually reactivated During these subsystem failure periods SCD intervals are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price correction process the SCD intervals are restored During these failure periods the SCD StartStop signals are not being transferred to the PTS Sixsecond actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods PTS develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods During the failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval observations The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a match between the price file and the metered MW files For example if SCD had intervals for and and the PTS integrated actuals covered the period then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent sets of data The interval then becomes a minute interval Solution Issue The system will be programmed such that it will recognize when an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by splitting the large interval with the assumption that the energy was delivered uniformly over the entire interval Retroactive to Nov the missing intervals will be created Through the monthly rebill and trueup process these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result Issue Dispatch Interval Type R When SCD is in a reserve pickup and the pickup is unsuccessful after minutes an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and sent to generators At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS an LBMP interval is also sent These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then ignored in BAS Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov all LBMP intervals generated as part of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted In the future the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting Issue Consistent Updated Price Postings Prior to January intervals updated as part of price corrections were posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format thus making it difficult for market participants to locate the correct data Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov an update of the current LBMP posting files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally posted The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price posting discrepancies and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov

Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw HAM Transactions Failing Checkout ECA A reissuance of ECA A Thank you for the presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance Unit and the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with the Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw concerning import and export transactions including wheelthrough transactions that fail the checkout procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating hour I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous support to the NYISO to reissue ECA A until the Market Participants can consider and approve and the NYISO can implement a tariff change required to permanently address the Market Design Flaw As stated in my Memorandum to you of September I agreed with your conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a Market Design Flaw as defined in Attachment Q to the ISO OATT Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities the TEPs As further stated in that Memorandum I agreed with your analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw would absent

agencies is ongoing to develop and implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance with the ISO Agreement Please reissue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action ECA and post it on the OASIS for implementation effective at the expiration of ECA A The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety days William J Museler President and CEO New York Independent System Operator cc Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action A Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply to Import and export transactions that are scheduled for an operating hour in the HourAhead Market HAM by the Balancing Market Evaluation BME and that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market Participant or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant Wheelthrough transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export transaction and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of both financial impacts as provided below This ECA shall not apply to import export or wheelthrough transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or action or neighboring control area operator error or action Rationale Import Transactions During the HAM resolution BME reduces commitments for energy resources within NYCA to accept scheduled import transactions at a specific proxy bus indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled import transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be elevated above the HAM price due to the failed import transaction The difference between the realtime price and the BME price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the realtime market Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction Export Transactions During the HAM resolution BME makes commitments for energy resources to supply scheduled export transactions up to the purchase price indicated by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus Where the scheduled export transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to the failed export transaction The difference between the BME price and the realtime price at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part of Schedule costs Under this ECA this amount when positive multiplied by the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction WheelThrough Transactions During the HAM resolution BME includes scheduled wheelthrough transactions up to the transmission congestion cost that equals the decremental bid indicated by the Market Participant Where the scheduled wheelthrough transaction fails checkout following BME the realtime energy price at both the import and export proxy busses may be elevated or depressed respectively due to the effects on transmission congestion of the failed wheelthrough transaction Under this ECA the effects of the import and export portions of the failed wheelthrough transaction will be calculated separately as though they were separate failed transactions The sum of those impacts shall be billed to the Market Participant that scheduled the failed wheelthrough transaction as the financial impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction Implementation Rules An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is delivered to the NYCA in realtime will be settled by the scheduling entity selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the scheduling entitys BME Bid Price and buying the energy that was not delivered from the LBMP Market at the RealTime LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy Generator Bus No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the delivering Control Area No payment will be required of or made to the Market Participant if the RealTime LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is received from NYCA in realtime will be settled by the scheduling entity buying the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling entitys BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP Market at the RealTime LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus No payment will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the receiving Control Area No payment will be required of or made to the Market Participant if the RealTime LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is higher than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in realtime will be settled by applying rules and of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at the export Proxy Generator Bus and summing the total of the two amounts for payment by the scheduling entity No payment will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area No payment will be required of or made to the Market Participant for the import or the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under rule or

Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw External Proxy Bus Prices During Transmission Constraints ECA B reissuance of ECA B Thank you for the presentation of the Market Monitoring and

effective at the expiration of ECA B The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety days William J Museler President and CEO New York Independent System Operator cc Market Participants via OASIS New York Independent System Operator Extraordinary Corrective Action B Market Design Flaw Regarding RealTime External Proxy Bus Prices Applicability This Extraordinary Correction Action ECA shall apply when the following two conditions are met Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus and The Balancing Market Evaluation BME resolves transmission congestion constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour resulting in transmission congestion charges in the HourAhead Market HAM Rationale When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus and the total proposed transactions exceed the available transfer capacity BME will resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental bid price or the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants proposing the transactions In the operating hour the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the External Proxy Bus are fixed and SCD is not required to resolve for transmission congestion costs associated with the scheduled transactions Therefore in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is binding RealTime prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different from the HAM prices due to the absence of transmission congestion costs being reflected in the RealTime price Currently scheduled HAM transactions at an External Proxy Bus are settled at the RealTime price at the External Proxy Bus during the operating hour and the import transactions receive a Bid Production Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and RealTime price The Market Design Flaw in the current process is that transmission congestion constraints present when BME schedules HAM transactions are not reflected in the RealTime settlement prices Under the rules set forth below the transmission congestion costs present in BME will be reflected in the SCD prices so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be charged the full cost of supplying that transaction up to the decremental bid cost or sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participant at the time the HAM transaction was proposed Implementation Rules These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus EPB by a transmission limitation or Desired Network Interchange DNI limit an EPB Limit For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an External Proxy Bus in the HAM the RealTime settlement price at that External Proxy Bus will be the greater of the realtime LBMP or the BME price at that External Proxy Bus Issued December pm Effective January Operating Hour Beginning

Market Participants Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted on the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement statements The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software necessary to update and or correct the prices associated with the categories listed below Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below the NYISO will recompute and post new real time weighted files Information on what intervals have been changed as a result of a specific issue noted below will be provided Issue Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a Reserve Pickup request the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup RPU period is the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval preceding the reserve pickup interval There were limited instances during the first months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and posted for the reserve pickup intervals Solution Issue For the period until the present all RPU intervals that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle immediately preceding the reserve pickup Any modifications made which result in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the rebill and trueup process in future months Issue Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices During the process of correcting and reposting prices the Generator or proxy bus prices were updated but not the Zonal or load prices Solution Issue ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their corresponding zonal prices will be copied into the zonal bus prices to overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files as these should be identical NOTE The Billing Accounting System BAS was coded to use the generator proxy bus price Therefore the BAS calculations have been consistent with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills Issue Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS Due to Loss of Communications At times there periods exist when communication links between operating systems namely SCD and Performance Tracking PTS in this case have failed and have to be manually reactivated During these subsystem failure periods SCD intervals are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price correction process the SCD intervals are restored During these failure periods the SCD StartStop signals are not being transferred to the PTS Sixsecond actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods PTS develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods During the failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval observations The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a match between the price file and the metered MW files For example if SCD had intervals for and and the PTS integrated actuals covered the period then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent sets of data The interval then becomes a minute interval Solution Issue The system will be programmed such that it will recognize when an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by splitting the large interval with the assumption that the energy was delivered uniformly over the entire interval Retroactive to Nov the missing intervals will be created Through the monthly rebill and trueup process these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result Issue Dispatch Interval Type R When SCD is in a reserve pickup and the pickup is unsuccessful after minutes an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and sent to generators At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS an LBMP interval is also sent These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then ignored in BAS Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov all LBMP intervals generated as part of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted In the future the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting Issue Consistent Updated Price Postings Prior to January intervals updated as part of price corrections were posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format thus making it difficult for market participants to locate the correct data Solution Issue Retroactively to Nov an update of the current LBMP posting files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally posted The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price posting discrepancies and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov

Discussion List The MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources that would fall within the DEC cap Any SCR resource that is exempt should not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP I never meant to imply they should As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply it seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not comply with the DECs wishes We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC Original Message From Aaron Breidenbaugh mailto Sent Saturday May PM To Mark Younger Cc PRLWG Larry DeWitt PACE jdprunkl Tech Team EMail List Subject Re mW DEC Cap for Emergency Exempt for EDRP We can flesh this discussion out next week but from the outset Marks and Roys comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive First of all not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap Many will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State Facility status either of which allows then to operate above the MW cap Lacking any DECimposed limit all such permitted facilities must be allowed to sign up for full SCR value Obviously other SCR resources not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and cannot be limited Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating Units CDEPGs as John Prunkl points out it is ISO Operations staff that will need to decide on a realtime basis which SCR units should be called Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls a unit called one day may or may not be needed the next Only in the case where there will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then as with generators there is no guarantee that all SCRcertified units will be there when called upon The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR but to decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during emergencies SCR resources that get signed up but cannot be called due to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP but cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee limitations I think this would mean a UCAP hit for future sales As a more fundamental matter I do not believe that DECs illadvised MW limit which was not agreed to by the NYISO is currently enforceable as a practical matter Only the NYISO knows when the MW cap is being approached and therefore the ISOs failure to adhere to that limit should not be held against the affected generators Nevertheless the DEC ruling appears to revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that the NYISO has violated the MW limit The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO which does not hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC If NYISO agrees to abide by the MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do so I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed Consider the following NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where the lights would go out in New York City with MW of CDEPGs but could stay on with MW I believe that the ISO operators might have no choice but to order the MW on and preserve reliability notwithstanding the DEC limitation By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which they have literally no knowledge let alone control DECs action currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State Facility Permits The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad assurances in SOASapproved Operating Manuals that operations staff can NEVER call on more than MW of CDEPGs at any given time Even then it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status revoked CDEPGs may be forced to seek realtime certifications from the NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed the MW limit I would be interested in the ISOs opinion on whether it can and will limit activations of CDEPGs to less than MW no matter what the circumstances Aaron Mark Younger wrote If only MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers The purpose of ICAP is to assure that the NYISO has capacity when it needs it Having the capacity and then not being allowed to use it makes the capacity worthless Resources that cannot be called upon are do not add to system security Original Message From mailto On Behalf Of jdprunkl Sent Friday May PM To Larry DeWitt PACE PRLWG Subject RE mW DEC Cap for Emergency Exempt for EDRP Larry A couple of comments I recommend that the MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations They are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete authority of which generators get run based on the situation Trying to fairly rotate which units get called at this late date given the hours of operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time in my opinion We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they have on expanding the exempt generator definition If people are not happy with the MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the MW cap calculation Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster If we want to kill the emergency program this is the best way to do it Again calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of the emergency situation A special case resource generator standing ready to serve even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at one time should not be penalized by this cap We may find situations where some of the SCR exempt generators called can not start or limit their generation hours for some reason In this case we need as many SCR resources ready to fill the void as possible Limit payments really hurts the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard to develop I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which generators get called in each zone If the Operations manual needs to be updated to reflect the MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets do it here not in the EDRP manual Looking forward to Mondays discussion Have a great weekend Best Regards John D Prunkl

there are several issues we will need to look at on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of emergency exempt when participating in the EDRP The problems needing solving that I am aware of so far concern the mW cap that DEC placed on the ISOs call for emergency customer generation Our understanding is that more than that amount can be signed up for the programbut only mWs can be called at any one time Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to regulate the NYISO I dont know But I do know that DEC would revoke this in heartbeat if they thought we were going to ignore itespecially after all these different parties including the ISO and the selfgeneration developers bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done Also the individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they were deemed to have been the ones who were over the mW limit in an emergency call There are two problems that I have seen both related to enrolling more than mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants First if there is more than mWs in the region being called we need to determine a method for who gets calledit could rotate in an equitable fashion But our manual should probably speak to this The other problem is that we probably shouldnt be paying full ICAP to mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half of them can respond to any ICAP call We might derate them in percentage to the subscription over the mWs Or some other system My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to come up with a solution on Monday I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today

NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List I wont repeat everything that Mark said I agree with all of it I publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies for upcoming ICAP However it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental change in the ICAP markets This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a call on the resource When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no energy price cap or effectively the price cap was today it is This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered last summer with a strike price of versus today An order of magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major to me particularly when coupled with all of the other new risk factors and general tightening of supply versus demand Original Message From mailtoOn Behalf Of Stephen Fernands Sent Thursday May AM To Tech Team EMail List Cc Brian Hayduk Jmoore Peter Duprey Subject Re NYISO MC Document from Stephen Fernands to MC Members Stephen Fernands writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Mark Thank you for your thoughtful response I think you raise some valid points but I do not think they change the end conclusion Fundamental Value of ICAP The principle of the ICAP market as in any market should be to reflect the value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market The question is whether the product being sold in this case ICAP has truly appreciated more then since the previous ICAP auctions Maybe but I doubt it AMP and Expected Revenue The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis although plausible seems fairly weak It presumes that generation owners were planning on violating the preexisting screens and counting on the revenue from those golden eggs Likewise the link between expected energy revenue and ICAP prices is tenuous at best Generators are not limited to receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in the bilateral market In either case the goal of the generation owner is to maximize revenue through all markets The ICAP market if functioning properly should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external transactions from that generator For example two generation owners owned two plants with the same characteristics One generation owner did a relatively good job selling a forward energy contract for the month procurement period while the other owner did a relatively poor job selling a similar contract In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same strategy maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the ICAP auction Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to overall lower profits Price Cap Load Bidding I wont comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place because it isnt going to be Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past only know it is expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding This is not a significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the underlying value of the ICAP product significant uncertainty to the New York market I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal made it difficult for generation owners to properly evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a month market For this reason as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter I believe that mitigating measures should be evaluated I am not passing judgment at this stage but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may be required to some or all of the months Next Steps If the MMU determines that there was economic and or physical withholding whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP I believe that it is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the committees for longer term resolution Stephen Fernands Consultant AES NewEnergy Original Message From Mark Younger To Tech Team EMail List Sent Wednesday May PM Subject FW NYISO MC Document from Stephen Fernands to MC Members Steve Fernands comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures Second he also uses the results of this summers stripmonthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the ICAP market Because the entire ICAP requirement is not cleared in a single auction the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal ICAP providers The results of this years auctions merely indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the earlier auctions Mr Fernands provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP issue If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired through the committee process Nonetheless one of the proposals should be killed at the outset Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes an obligation to bid into the energy market no ICAP owners should ever be automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction or any other auction Mr Fernands suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself The act of choosing not to bid into the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has chosen to exclude itself Mark

ICAP deficiency auction results are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market This misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that Unlike the electric commodity there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs for suppliers of ICAP Since last summer there have been very significant changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator or external ICAP provider a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately recovered from the energy market In return for this revenue the generator accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO dayahead energy market every day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or forced outage The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it requires from the ICAP market to continue operating This calculation is based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits from the energy market expected revenues less expected fuel costs For external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated to another market or having no obligations to any market Clearly in each case the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon the expectations of the New York energy market There have been several adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy markets surrounding New York These include The Circuit BreakerAMP The Circuit BreakerAMP creates both a concern that the dayahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed The potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters fuel costs or emissions costs Additionally while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid Finally the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM then they should have received In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress prices there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated This was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO has failed to provide any description of how this process will work There is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the New York market Price Capped Load Bidding The price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the DAM market prices This provides the possibility that dayahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior The only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator dayahead market bids As addressed above the application of the Circuit BreakerAMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal This proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation Measures There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness The penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers The penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power Finally the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market Interestingly the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP Deficiency auction The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the NYISO energy market Most notably there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority Fortunately both of these illconsidered proposals were ultimately withdrawn However the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the ICAP market Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr Fernands argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem First he lists the change in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the ICAP markets When generators bid into last summers auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the NYISO markets There also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer Compared to last summer ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures Second he also uses the results of this summers stripmonthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the ICAP market Because the entire ICAP requirement is not cleared in a single auction the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal ICAP providers The results of this years auctions merely indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the earlier auctions Mr Fernands provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP issue If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired through the committee process Nonetheless one of the proposals should be killed at the outset Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes an obligation to bid into the energy market no ICAP owners should ever be automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction or any other auction Mr Fernands suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself The act of choosing not to bid into the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has chosen to exclude itself Mark Younger Vice President Slater Consulting Werking Road East Greenbush NY ph fax Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday May PM To Subject

the clarification regardless of what triggers mitigation it is still an automated process that bypasses due process System unit and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to determine market power are dynamic you would assume that they are fixed Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of the system As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity that is not even taken into consideration Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as an example MMbtu who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly basis If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see that would be set by an internal generator Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the Market Mitigation Plan The default reference price for a generators energy is based on recently accepted bids for energy from that generator In the event that such data are unavailable a default reference price is either by negotiation with the generator or by an estimate of cost What defines an accepted bid Is it the dispatch of a generator with payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is higher This is not clear to me What happened to the negotiation part In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery part of those costs are fixed cost recovery None of the default reference bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs Thanks Joe Original Message From Mark Younger mailto Sent Saturday April AM To Subject RE Automatic Mitigation Mark Younger writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding The price is the lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any mitigation This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed The price will not trigger mitigation in and of its Whenever one of the zones has a price that is above the AMP will run to determine if any units have crossed the conduct threshold If there are any units that have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact threshold has been triggered If the impact threshold is triggered in any zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated ie reference bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold If the impact threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be used Original Message From mailto On Behalf Of Kirkpatrick Joe Sent Saturday April AM To Cc Subject Automatic Mitigation Kirkpatrick Joe writes to the NYISOTECHEXCHANGE Discussion List The NYISO has chosen as representative of a level to trigger market mitigation I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of A increase or an increase of is coincidently the same price I am questioning the determination of this price and its application in the market mitigation plan In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic withholding How does the price reference a specific unit I am not sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire statewide price and then compare it to a generators bid If a generators fuel costs without fixed cost recovery is that unit would presumably never bid below its cost it would always bid as a minimum How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified in the market mitigation plan A increase would be and an increase of would be and yet using the AMP interpretation of the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding is It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market Mitigation Plan The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not The simple question would be is the threshold representative of every generators bid to determine economic withholding The answer can only be no how can it be The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator was exercising market power The determination of whether a generator was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all of the prevalent market unit and system conditions to determine if that unit was in fact exercising market power The more complex the system the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised How does a price trigger or any automatic threshold take all of the complexities of a situation into account It cannot I suspect that is why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power determination The full facts are presented and evaluated every case is unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high as a result of market power A better solution would be to delay the prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made In the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they should be held in reserve for determination of market power Prices can be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power at least then due process can be followed Market participants can be consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is required for market power evaluation The AMP is still in place but is only used to identify potential market power until a human evaluation is done Joe
