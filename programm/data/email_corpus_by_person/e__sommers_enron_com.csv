trip to Seoul and we recognize she is going out of her way to assist EGA on this issue Darrell felt Heidi earned the trust of the SK accountants during the audit and this would help us receive the additional information we need quickly As Beth states below EGA will go with Heidi and take the ball to make sure all the issues are resolved Again we appreciate Heidi and her extra effort and Beth working with us on this issue Sommers Original Message From Apollo Beth Sent Wednesday May PM To Causey Richard Buy Rick Beck Sally Cc Port David Sommers Jeffrey E Dyson Fernley Subject Action plan on Seoul Issue from recent Doorstep We had a conference call this afternoon to discuss the next steps Participants Beth Shona David Port Jeff Sommers John BergrenEAS Heidi Mason person who did Seoul Doorstep from Australia Darrell Kinder in charge of the Enron Seoul office and the SK relationship The net result of our discussion was that Heidi will be making another trip to Seoul in weeks to scope out the deals since the inception of the JV Jan and to validate that the assumptions that she made in her analysis are correct One of Jeff Sommers people from Houston will accompany her in order to meet some of the people there and take a hand off from Heidisince she has a day job in Australiain terms of following up to see that these issues are resolved Major Issues to be looked at on round see further detail from Heidi below Figure out if SK Gas really is intentionally running unprofitable transactions thru the JV with their owned entity SK Global and quantifynote the mm below is on an accrual basis not MTM Emphasize the need to both the JV and to Enron SK that they need to formalize a trading policybrought up by AA in the doorstep they did a year ago Take a deeper look at their International salesoutside of Seoul as there are much fewer controls in place credit issues could be a problem Propose some regular reporting that should go to the Enron JV people to monitor transations and improve communication I know Heidi is not thrilled about going backshe had to eat meals with locals who were eating eye ballsand she is very busy running the Australian operations and back office but knows that this is an important issue Darrell Kinder feels like she will get the best results Fernley just an FYI to you so that you know she will be heading back there for a few days Jeff and I will schedule a seperate download session with the of you for the SK Gas JV once the next trip is complete Beth Original Message From Mason Heidi Sent Wednesday May AM To Shona nron Apollo Beth Kinder Darrell Ford Allan Subject Preliminary to tomorrows call I have been talking to Darrell about the additional work that we need to look to do at SK Gas At a minimum the things I believe we need to do are Obtain details of the profitability of all affiliated company deals for the period since inception of the JV I have received from SK Gas a breakup of the total PL for by transaction type It is the Cargo trading as per below that we are interested in Overall there appears to be little movement therefore in the net profit for the year to v the rolling months we have OLE Object Picture Metafile The data that we have for May to April indicates a total loss for trading with SK Global of approx mn and this is after the inclusion of the one large profit deal that made mn Without that deal the loss would have been mn dollars versus a profit of mn on trades with independant counterparties which is the main reason why we feel we need to further assess these deals further Regardless of the outcome of the testing however we need a better process to allow for a current review of these deals either before or when they are done in line with the JV agreement We need to determine from SK Gas their trading policy be this written or verbal There may perhaps be a reason why the deals with SK Global show a more frequent loss if for example SK Global take shipments that SK Gas can not sell elsewhere ie a buyer of the last resort Without knowing the policy it is very hard to come to any clear conclusions as to the trend seen to date We need to review the circumstances of some of the larger SK Global deals to try and assess why they were loss making trades Again without knowing the trading policy and doing the review so far in arrears makes it difficult to effectively review all the circumstances of the trade Therefore going forward we need to ensure that we implement a policy that ensures SK Corp staff are able to review these trades as they occur when the market factors are more to hand I have discussed with Darrell the option of using resources closer to hand to resolve this but appreciate his comments that due to the sensitive nature of the arrangements this will be less than ideal At the same time I am not available until the week of the th so timing may also be an issue Allan Ford is not available to come with me but I do have an additional resource from Australia if required Again there may be an option to use someone else from the region or AAs who we will need as translators anyway Happy to get all feedback and ideas on this plan for tomorrow as I want to have the most comprehensive work plan possible in place before we leave to ensure the visit is as efficient as possible Thanks Heidi Heidi E Mason Chief Financial
