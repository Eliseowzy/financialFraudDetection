<20076429.1075852472582.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tamara.johnson@enron.com,2001-08-07 14:48:52,PX Credit Calculations and Comments Cc Attached is a Word document with my notes from the PGE meeting last Thursday August I am also including an Excel spreadsheet that shows how the PX credit is calculated under the various methods that have been discussed My conclusion is PGE continues to make unpredictable and arbitrary decisions without applying with the CPUC If not for the PX receivable I would recommend an immediate protest to halt this behaviour They are also bending the existing rules so far as to strain credibility The SCE method of calculating a PX credit is the best choice both from a logical perspective and does not require an adjustment to our mark Again setting aside the PX receivable issue Many external parties support it the CPUC is heading in this direction It makes sense because it keeps DA customers paying for the services they use ie TD DA may be getting a break to the extent the current generation rate pays for past sins ie if market prices are below embedded generation plus the cent surcharge This is where a yettobe determined nonbypassable CTC may come from Setting the PX credit equal to the Market Price is unlikely to be approved on a goforward basis If PX Credit Market the DA customer will only pay frozen rates Although this confirms to AB since the rate freeze is not technically over it is unlikely that this will go forward since bundled customers are paying more than ratefreeze rates there is no agreedupon market price

<27315888.1075843416288.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,tamara.johnson@enron.com,2001-04-06 03:28:00,Davis seems to be endorsing CPUC rate proposal in his Press Conferencetodays LA Times Davis is essentially endorsing the CPUCs proposed rate design where Residential pays less than their share ie less than the cents He is also suggesting that contrary to the CPUC decision last week that some of the increase go to bailing out the IOUs if they sell the transmission Davis Acknowledges Need for Rate Hike Electricity In a statewide TV broadcast he says the average would be For the first time he calls situation a crisis By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOAfter spending months voicing opposition to rate hikes Gov Gray Davis acknowledged to a statewide television audience Thursday night the need for an electricity rate increase that would average For the first time calling it an energy crisis Davis enumerated steps he has taken then said he has fought tooth and nail against raising rates But citing a need for increases the Democratic governor called for a tiered system in which people who use the most electricity pay the mostas much as more if they use more than twice their minimum allotment Heres the point The more you use the more you pay Davis said The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and price gouging Davis said his proposed rate plan is sufficient to help reduce the billion debt of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Although the bulk of the rate increase would be used to help California finance bonds for longterm power purchases about to would be earmarked for the utilitiesso long as they agree to sell their transmission lines to the state according to the administration The decision to offer the utilities at least some rate hike monies brought a sharp response from lawmakers Consumer advocates also are sure to be unhappy We are not in this business to bail out these guys said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Added Harry Snyder of Consumers Union Absolute giveaway He is going to pay them off completely for all their mistakes The governor took the unusual step of reserving air time on statewide television at a time when he is slipping in polls and surveys show that the public is increasingly concerned about the energy crisis Gov Pete Wilson took a similar step during the recession in when he moved to raise taxes and cut government spending The speech took on greater urgency as the California Independent System Operator the entity that oversees power distribution warned Thursday that the state will face days of rotating blackouts if consumers and businesses use the same amount of electricity this summer that they did last year The blackouts could be extensive enough to darken million homes at once The governors speech came hours after the Legislature approved a record billion in energy conservation measures designed to provide consumers with incentives to reduce electricity use In his speech Davis renewed his call to Californians to curtail electricity use by at least even as a new report was issued warning that the state faces repeated summer blackouts because of a major gap in the supply of power during the coming months We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer Davis said The governor did not speak in detail on any issue including the rate hike The talk lasted a mere five minutes delivered in fewer than words Under Davis proposal Southern California Edison residential customers would face an average increase of cents per kilowatt hour San Diego Gas Electric customers would have a cent hike while Pacific Gas Electric would have a cent boost Business rates would rise slightly more Davis blamed the rate hikes on rising natural gas prices a lack of adequate generation and the federal governments refusal to cap wholesale power prices Rates for customers of the states two largest utilities rose in January That boost remains in effect Legislation approved earlier this year bars further rate increases for those who use up to more than their socalled baseline allocation According to administration estimates of consumers would experience no rate hike beyond the boost approved in January A fourth of all households would face increases averaging Under the proposal which requires Public Utilities Commission approval people who use up to of their baseline allocation would see rates on that portion of their electricity use go up by plus the already imposed for a total of Electricity users who consume more than twice their baseline allocation would pay between and more for kilowatts used beyond of their baseline allocation Davis proposed rate increase is somewhat lower than that proposed by the PUC in part because he had more information including the price that the state is paying for electricity his aides said My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Davis said Although there has been wide news coverage of the crisis the governors aides said Davis felt a need to talk directly to Californians to sum up the steps that he has taken to solve the problem Perhaps adding to the urgency utility customers could start seeing increases in their bills as early as next month Further raising the stakes for the speech Davis warned this week that supplies will be so short that there could be blackouts by the end of the month and continue into May and June The public is more aware of what is going on on this issue than any other issue I have seen ever said Democratic political consultant Gale Kaufman People have gotten three or four bills that theyre unhappy with and they may have been in a blackout or two There is a concern for the future By not talking to the public for a long time Kaufman said and focusing it on one speech in one day people will dissect this five minutes much more than if he would have had a regular dialogue In what some political consultants see as a reflection of Davis declining political strength a recent Times poll showed that in Davis hometown of Los Angeles only are more likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Davis while would be less likely Several recent private polls show that a majority of Californians would not vote to reelect Davis if he were on the ballot today though Davis does not face voters in a general election for months giving him plenty of time to recover People need to be reassured that there is a strong sense of direction said Bill Carrick a Democratic consultant I dont think people are looking for a magic wand But they need a sense that there is sense of direction Other political consultants said Davis used television to get his message out because newspaper accounts have raised questions about his handling of the situation Also voters who get the bulk of their information from television news generally have less knowledge about the nuances of the crisis He is not doing well with the print story said Republican consultant Wayne C Johnson so he has decided to change venues Johnson like many consultants also said the governors declining poll numbers likely influenced his decision to make the television appearance carried on most stations across the state during pm news shows Gray Davis doesnt do anything that the polls dont dictate Johnson said He is doing this because the polls show his support is in freefall Until Thursday Davis had not characterized the situation as a crisis instead calling it a challenge That euphemism raised the hackles of many legislators Its pretty clear The public is angry and scared said state Sen Don Perata DAlameda They want a sense that someone is in control and that there is some certitude of where were going Were lacking both The Legislature meanwhile approved two measures touted as ways to cut the states power needs this summer when hot temperatures traditionally cause demand to surgea situation that this year could result in blackouts The bills had been bogged down in squabbling between the Assembly and Senate The delay raises questions about whether the conservation incentives will be in place long enough to have an immediate effect The bills a million measure by state Sen Byron Sher DStanford and a million measure by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe DSan Diego contain a dizzying range of financial carrots designed to help people cut power use There is million to help low and moderateincome consumers replace energywasting appliances such as old refrigerators with new more energyefficient equipment million to help consumers replace older lighting systems million to teach school children about energy efficiency and million for electricity meters for businesses The Senate bill won final passage on a vote the Assembly bill cleared the Legislature on a vote However not everyone supported the concept of government subsidies to reduce power use Meanwhile utility watchers issued gloomy reports early Thursday helping to drag down the stocks of Edison International and PGE Corp parent corporations of the beleaguered utilities Edison closed at per share down cents or while PGE fell to per share down cents or on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors said it is unlikely that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric will regain a sound credit rating soon The Wall Street debtrating firm lowered the utilities credit rating to highrisk junkbond status in January when they began defaulting on debt Standard Poors cited a lack of action by Davis and state legislators and said rate increases approved by the PUC will not be sufficient to pay all electricity costs Banks and other creditors will run out of patience before long unless a settlement is reached to help the utilities pay past debts Standard Poors said The firm predicted that the coming weeks are likely to be critical if the utilities are to be made financially sound companies once again and avoid bankruptcy proceedings

endorsing the CPUCs proposed rate design where Residential pays less than their share ie less than the cents He is also suggesting that contrary to the CPUC decision last week that some of the increase go to bailing out the IOUs if they sell the transmission Davis Acknowledges Need for Rate Hike Electricity In a statewide TV broadcast he says the average would be For the first time he calls situation a crisis By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOAfter spending months voicing opposition to rate hikes Gov Gray Davis acknowledged to a statewide television audience Thursday night the need for an electricity rate increase that would average For the first time calling it an energy crisis Davis enumerated steps he has taken then said he has fought tooth and nail against raising rates But citing a need for increases the Democratic governor called for a tiered system in which people who use the most electricity pay the mostas much as more if they use more than twice their minimum allotment Heres the point The more you use the more you pay Davis said The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and price gouging Davis said his proposed rate plan is sufficient to help reduce the billion debt of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric Although the bulk of the rate increase would be used to help California finance bonds for longterm power purchases about to would be earmarked for the utilitiesso long as they agree to sell their transmission lines to the state according to the administration The decision to offer the utilities at least some rate hike monies brought a sharp response from lawmakers Consumer advocates also are sure to be unhappy We are not in this business to bail out these guys said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco Added Harry Snyder of Consumers Union Absolute giveaway He is going to pay them off completely for all their mistakes The governor took the unusual step of reserving air time on statewide television at a time when he is slipping in polls and surveys show that the public is increasingly concerned about the energy crisis Gov Pete Wilson took a similar step during the recession in when he moved to raise taxes and cut government spending The speech took on greater urgency as the California Independent System Operator the entity that oversees power distribution warned Thursday that the state will face days of rotating blackouts if consumers and businesses use the same amount of electricity this summer that they did last year The blackouts could be extensive enough to darken million homes at once The governors speech came hours after the Legislature approved a record billion in energy conservation measures designed to provide consumers with incentives to reduce electricity use In his speech Davis renewed his call to Californians to curtail electricity use by at least even as a new report was issued warning that the state faces repeated summer blackouts because of a major gap in the supply of power during the coming months We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer Davis said The governor did not speak in detail on any issue including the rate hike The talk lasted a mere five minutes delivered in fewer than words Under Davis proposal Southern California Edison residential customers would face an average increase of cents per kilowatt hour San Diego Gas Electric customers would have a cent hike while Pacific Gas Electric would have a cent boost Business rates would rise slightly more Davis blamed the rate hikes on rising natural gas prices a lack of adequate generation and the federal governments refusal to cap wholesale power prices Rates for customers of the states two largest utilities rose in January That boost remains in effect Legislation approved earlier this year bars further rate increases for those who use up to more than their socalled baseline allocation According to administration estimates of consumers would experience no rate hike beyond the boost approved in January A fourth of all households would face increases averaging Under the proposal which requires Public Utilities Commission approval people who use up to of their baseline allocation would see rates on that portion of their electricity use go up by plus the already imposed for a total of Electricity users who consume more than twice their baseline allocation would pay between and more for kilowatts used beyond of their baseline allocation Davis proposed rate increase is somewhat lower than that proposed by the PUC in part because he had more information including the price that the state is paying for electricity his aides said My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Davis said Although there has been wide news coverage of the crisis the governors aides said Davis felt a need to talk directly to Californians to sum up the steps that he has taken to solve the problem Perhaps adding to the urgency utility customers could start seeing increases in their bills as early as next month Further raising the stakes for the speech Davis warned this week that supplies will be so short that there could be blackouts by the end of the month and continue into May and June The public is more aware of what is going on on this issue than any other issue I have seen ever said Democratic political consultant Gale Kaufman People have gotten three or four bills that theyre unhappy with and they may have been in a blackout or two There is a concern for the future By not talking to the public for a long time Kaufman said and focusing it on one speech in one day people will dissect this five minutes much more than if he would have had a regular dialogue In what some political consultants see as a reflection of Davis declining political strength a recent Times poll showed that in Davis hometown of Los Angeles only are more likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by Davis while would be less likely Several recent private polls show that a majority of Californians would not vote to reelect Davis if he were on the ballot today though Davis does not face voters in a general election for months giving him plenty of time to recover People need to be reassured that there is a strong sense of direction said Bill Carrick a Democratic consultant I dont think people are looking for a magic wand But they need a sense that there is sense of direction Other political consultants said Davis used television to get his message out because newspaper accounts have raised questions about his handling of the situation Also voters who get the bulk of their information from television news generally have less knowledge about the nuances of the crisis He is not doing well with the print story said Republican consultant Wayne C Johnson so he has decided to change venues Johnson like many consultants also said the governors declining poll numbers likely influenced his decision to make the television appearance carried on most stations across the state during pm news shows Gray Davis doesnt do anything that the polls dont dictate Johnson said He is doing this because the polls show his support is in freefall Until Thursday Davis had not characterized the situation as a crisis instead calling it a challenge That euphemism raised the hackles of many legislators Its pretty clear The public is angry and scared said state Sen Don Perata DAlameda They want a sense that someone is in control and that there is some certitude of where were going Were lacking both The Legislature meanwhile approved two measures touted as ways to cut the states power needs this summer when hot temperatures traditionally cause demand to surgea situation that this year could result in blackouts The bills had been bogged down in squabbling between the Assembly and Senate The delay raises questions about whether the conservation incentives will be in place long enough to have an immediate effect The bills a million measure by state Sen Byron Sher DStanford and a million measure by Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe DSan Diego contain a dizzying range of financial carrots designed to help people cut power use There is million to help low and moderateincome consumers replace energywasting appliances such as old refrigerators with new more energyefficient equipment million to help consumers replace older lighting systems million to teach school children about energy efficiency and million for electricity meters for businesses The Senate bill won final passage on a vote the Assembly bill cleared the Legislature on a vote However not everyone supported the concept of government subsidies to reduce power use Meanwhile utility watchers issued gloomy reports early Thursday helping to drag down the stocks of Edison International and PGE Corp parent corporations of the beleaguered utilities Edison closed at per share down cents or while PGE fell to per share down cents or on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors said it is unlikely that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric will regain a sound credit rating soon The Wall Street debtrating firm lowered the utilities credit rating to highrisk junkbond status in January when they began defaulting on debt Standard Poors cited a lack of action by Davis and state legislators and said rate increases approved by the PUC will not be sufficient to pay all electricity costs Banks and other creditors will run out of patience before long unless a settlement is reached to help the utilities pay past debts Standard Poors said The firm predicted that the coming weeks are likely to be critical if the utilities are to be made financially sound companies once again and avoid bankruptcy proceedings
