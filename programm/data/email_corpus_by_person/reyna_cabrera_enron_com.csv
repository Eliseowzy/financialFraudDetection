Reyna Sent Tuesday August AM To Kirk Steve Neville Sue Miller Kent Cc Blair Lynn Bodnar Michael Buchanan John Kowalke Terry Medeles Gerry Black Legale January Steven Subject FW SBA Priority during Allocations Steve Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs priority during an Allocation The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations For your information below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue Thanks for your continued help in this matter Reyna Cabrera X Original Message From Bodnar Michael Sent Tuesday August AM To Blair Lynn Cc Buchanan John Kowalke Terry Medeles Gerry Cabrera Reyna January Steven Subject RE SBA Priority during Allocations I believe Reyna et al have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward but I will confirm Regarding With the new contract system being developed the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be doable I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort Original Message From Blair Lynn Sent Tuesday August AM To Bodnar Michael Cc Buchanan John Kowalke Terry Medeles Gerry Cabrera Reyna January Steven Subject RE SBA Priority during Allocations Mike thanks for the update I have a couple of questionscomments Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions Anything we can automate I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement list I like the idea of automating the last bullet I am not sure if it is in CMS or elsewhere but I would like to be sure we pursue this automation Thanks Lynn Original Message From Bodnar Michael Sent Monday August AM To Blair Lynn Cc Buchanan John Kowalke Terry Medeles Gerry Cabrera Reyna Subject FW SBA Priority during Allocations Lynn Below is a list of issues that were raised at the meeting held w Gerry and Reyna attended by John and I As far as I know we havent yet heard back from Sue regarding the issues raised Immediately below is LTs response to adding a hook in CMS that would distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements More as it develops Original Message From Trevino Linda Sent Monday August AM To Cabrera Reyna Bodnar Michael Subject RE SBA Priority during Allocations I dont have a problem adding a subtype on the ITs of SBA Im not sure I understand your last bullet Can you give me more info LT Original Message From Cabrera Reyna Sent Tuesday August PM To Neville Sue Medeles Gerry Cc Threet Kay Bodnar Michael Trevino Linda Subject SBA Priority during Allocations Sue During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations some of the following issues came up Gerry correct me if I misunderstood anything If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority at Primary Points Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate Might have some mad shippers How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation Interruptible Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as SBA IT This is for the future contracts system Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria Reyna Cabrera
