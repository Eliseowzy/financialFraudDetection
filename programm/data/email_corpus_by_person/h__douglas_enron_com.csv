the respective item Best regards Steve Original Message From Kitchen Louise Sent Wednesday July PM To Douglas Stephen H Subject RE EWS Tax Department Update Good report these are all the deals under the Americas which I know nothing about what are they Thanks Louise Panama Trading Office Had discussions with the Transaction Support group and PWCPanama regarding Panamanian tax return Enron of the Americas is the percent shareholder of a Panamanian trading subsidiary called Enron Capital Trade Global Resources Corp ECTGR Essentially by transacting through this company and keeping income invested offshore Enron is able to avoid payment of taxes on trading income generated by ECTGR This result however requires that ECTGR trade in Panama in a manner that is not taxable essentially ECTGR must trade products that are delivered outside of Panama or within Panama inside a freetrade zone The Panamanian government has requested that we establish that ECTGRs trading income is derived from qualified activity and the EWS Tax Group is in turn working with Transaction Support which books ECTGRs trades under a Services Agreement and PWC which files the Panamanian return for us to properly document things for the government We are confident that our position with regard to ECTGR will be agreed with Project Atlas Tube Atlas Met with origination team and EWS Reporting and Analysis Tax group to discuss initial deal structure and related tax consequences Atlas consists of an inventory management strategy whereby an Enron special purpose vehicle will both buy hot rolled coil steel from and resell the same to Atlas Tube Inc on a justintime inventory basis This is a very interesting deal but was misplaced in the report it should be listed under Enron Industrial Markets It is similar to the Huntco transaction and I would be delighted to send you a transaction chart if it would be of interest Let me know Project Desperado Velocity III Met with Enron Corp tax and deal team regarding Velocity III transaction and structure Reviewed and revised transaction agreements and discussed such with Enron Corp tax and deal team This transaction involved the sale of various equity investments that had been made by Enron of the Americas in various companies most significantly Catalytica Advanced Mobile Power Systems and Hanover Compressor to Whitewing Associates LP A total of approximately million was raised in connection with the sale and resulted in positive funds flow for accounting purposes Whitewing LP is a deconsolidated entity in which Enron possesses an approximate percent economic interest deconsolidation is achieved as it has been explained to me by virtue of Enron sharing voting control with an unrelated person the Osprey Trust which in turn is essentially John Hancock The sale of these investments from a tax perspective resulted in a slight tax gain approximately million that had been previously reserved for for financial reporting purposes Project Hartwell and Project Athens Energy Centers Advised regarding state income franchise sales and use taxes relating to construction of power plants in Clark and Hunt Counties in Georgia Plants to be sold prior to commercial operation Enron of the Americas is developing two plants described as Simple Power Plants in Georgia with the intent of selling the plants before they become operational EWS Tax analyzed the various state and local taxes applicable to the construction of the plants inputs ie natural gas to the plants during operations and income resulting from operations Georgia imposes a sales tax on components used to construct the plants granting as well however an exemption from such taxes if appropriate tax certificates are acquired provides a state tax exemption on the purchase of natural gas if it is used to generate electricity but otherwise the local government charges a percent tax on such natural gas and finally taxes income earned by the company generating the electricity at percent on US federal adjusted net income Utiliquest Transaction Met with deal team to discuss disposition of ENAs interest in Utiliquest LLC Reviewed unit purchase agreement and met with outside counsel to other unit holders to discuss tax structuring and benefits of using synthetic h structure Utiliquest is an investment in a utility locating company that the Principal Investment Group of Enron of the Americas is selling EWS Tax helped develop the structure by which the purchaser of the investment will be able to push their purchase price paid for the stock in Utiliquest to the assets of Utiliquest essentially this improves the purchasers aftertax yield through increased depreciation without detriment to Enron Original Message From Douglas Stephen H Sent
