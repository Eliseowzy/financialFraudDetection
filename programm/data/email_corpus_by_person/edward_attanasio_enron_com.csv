<4376265.1075851883384.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,edward.attanasio@enron.com,2001-01-23 08:23:00,Re NCL Preserve History Bakersfield Cc State Take Permit and the Consevation Easement were mailed yesterday Please let me know if you dont receive them by Friday You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare threatened and endangered species However with the sole exception of the San Joaquin Antelope Squirrel which is state listed only all state listed animal species are federally listed as well Though the lists are virtually identical the rankings on each list are not that is a species considered endangered by the state may only be considered threatened by the feds and viceversaetc Listed species of plant on the other hand are not the same federally and state Plus there indeed are species of concern within the easement that are not yet listed Randi McCormick has some pretty comprehensive listings on both of these points that is lists of federally and state rare threatened and endangered species of plants and species of concern Ill have her send info on this to you Lastly I dont have a contact with the State Database folks and I dont think weve ever dealt with them I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny I wasnt meaning to be I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came about In any event I would very much look forward to discussing with you andor Larry andor whomever else you think should be involved the habitat training issue the status and further processing of our Federal Take Permit Application and related topics Thanks ETA John NRON PM To Edward OTT cc Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON William NRON Larry CampbellET NRON Subject Re NCL Preserve History Bakersfield Ed Maybe you didnt forward the copy of the Arco USFWS ITP on to Lou which was sent on to me regardless what I have in my possession is entitled US Fish and Wildlife service Incidental Take Permit No dated and made out to a permittee named Arco Western Energy It is helpful to have it and I am grateful to whomever sent it my way I do appreciate your relating the chain of custody of the federal permit for the North Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve NCLEP Thanks also for sending Randis phone numbers I would appreciate a copy of the CDFG permit that has been assigned to EOTT and a copy of the Conservation Easement I assume that the State CDFG permit relates to only state rare threatened and endangered species or does it also cover the federally listed species Are there any species of concern that the CDFG are working with within the easement boundaries beyond those officially listed Do you have a contact with the California Natural Heritage Program California Natural Diversity Database within the Califormia Dept of Fish Game that you have been visiting with about the NCLEP Again I am not trying to argue the point about Kenny Maltby My point to you and others is that Kenny plainly told me that he has no comprehensive knowledge about the permit and the requirements of the permit He said he relies on you and Randi McCormick for that Your attempt to stopgap with Kenny since Gary had departed to ensure representation in the field for the CDFG is understood I will want to further discuss with you the need to possibly have more people knowledgeable in the matters of the permit and involved in the execution of the same with the CDFG From Edward OTT on PM To John NRON cc Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON Subject Re NCL Preserve History Bakersfield I dont believe I sent you the Arco USFWS ITP No federal take permit was ever assigned to EOTT by Koch because Koch represented that it did not have such a permit rather it purportedly was having discussions with USFWS re this issue pending at the time of the asset sale to EOTT As I understand it any such federal permit was not assigned by Arco to Koch for whatever reason and consequently EOTT ended up not having a federal permit assigned to it by Koch Instead we took over the application process from Koch That application is still pending The permit from which I quoted in the email was the California Department of Fish and Game ITP between CDFG and Koch which was assigned to EOTT in connection with the asset purchase Ill be happy to send you a copy along with a copy of the Conservation Easement that is referenced in my last email Regarding Kenny Maltby the short answer is of course ETS can and indeed should designate whomever it thinks best to be the representative responsible for communications with the CDFG and for oversing the compliance with the take permit But as of last Wednesday the designated representative was Gary Fuller Matt Hughes et al informed me that they wanted to begin construction on the Rogas Line by February and possibly as early as January Consequently a new representative had to be named on short order in fact the permit technically requires such notice days in advance of ground disturbing activities While the CDFG will cut us some slack in view of Garys departure that indulgence is probably not limitless I continue to believe that Kenny M was the only logical choice While I believe Rick Suderman and Scott Jones specifically and all plant employees generally are aware of the habitat and a number of the operational issues covered by the take permit I believe Kenny has a more comprehensive knowledge of the permit requirements in their entirety including preconstruction and construction measures and compensation acreage requirements as well as how they apply to pipeline construction generally and this project specifically I tend to think that Kennys warm body comment is more a reflection of his modesty than the intent here in fact I thought of Kenny only because I did not want just a warm body appointed Simply put I was attempting a stopgap measure to ensure that this specific project got off the ground on ETSs own schedule I was in no way attempting to dictate who would be the representative for the long term Randi McCormicks phone is and her fax is If you need anything else please let me know Thanks ETA John NRON PM To Edward OTT cc Louis SoldanoET NRON Molly ott Randy NRON Rich JollyET NRON Subject NCL Preserve History Bakersfield Ed Lou forwarded your email on to me and I appreciate getting it The information I received I assume from you is actually a copy of a USFWS Incidental Take Permit ITP dated which is related to a Habitat Conservation Plan HCP covering a portion of the San Joaquin Valley floor in Kern County CA The permittee is shown as Arco Western Energy I am assuming that the ITP was transferred to Koch and then subsequently to EOTT as those property sales consummated In order to more fully understand how this permit relates to the EOTT facilities could I obtain a copy of the permit from which you are quoting in your email I dont find those sections or quotes in the copy Lou forwarded I found a paragraph very interesting in your email relating that Kenny Maltby is the designated representative responsible for communications with the California Department of Fish and Game and for overseeing the compliance with the take permit and that the two of you are the only personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements It is my understanding that Kenny reports into Randy Rices organization and works for Rich Jolly I believe that Kenny was only designated last Friday by a letter mailed to California Game and Fish as such a representative and in his own words he is a warm body for the California Game and Fish to contact related to the permit I have no problem with Kenny being a contact during the pipeline construction in the area but may want to make some further changes on contacts as we learn more about the Conservation Easement and its restrictions I recall that Randi McCormick was the CWB being used for work in the Conservation Area and I plan to give her a call By the way can you please furnish her phone number for me Again please furnish a more complete copy of the permit and any other information that might explain more fully the easement and its requirements Thanks John
