from northern Europe to transport to Italy transiting it through Germany and Switzerland despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August The gas which started flowing at on Thursday th May will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas residential customers within the four municipalities The current contract lasts for five months Congratulations to
