MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetDISO XMailer AOL for Mac PostGM sub XMozillaStatus Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No May Brown Says Offensive Line Much Improved Cites Other Problems Heading into aDays Coach Mack Brown says he and his assistant coaches have thoroughly reviewed the tapes of the Longhorns spring practices and have concluded it was a very productive period The offensive line has received much of the blame for the lateseason Longhorn swoon last year but Brown says the offensive linemen as a group showed a lot more maturity and perseverance in the spring I think the offensive line improved a lot he told me in an interview las t week Asked what he thought prompted the improvement he said The embarrassment they felt leaving the Cotton Bowl and the fact that they have been together a year more While he didnt elaborate on the maturity question it is worth noting that four of the five offensive linemen who started in the spring have never redshirted The reason they never redshirted is the lack of depth in the offensive lin e when they got here which forced Brown to play most of the linemen when the y were true freshmen At Nebraska which has been the top program in the Big year in and year out all offensive linemen redshirt and most of them dont start until thei r fourth year when they are redshirt juniors Applying that yardstick to the Texas offensive line none of the four spri ng starters would have started last year and only senior LT Leonard Davis and junior center Matt Anderson would start this year because they are entering their fourth seasons There are exceptions even at Nebraska because their center last season wa s a thirdyear sophomore but the Huskers and the other teams who seem t o always be in the hunt for the national championship go mostly with fourthandfifthyear players redshirted juniors and seniors in their offensive lines The five offensive line starters at Nebraska this spring already have seasons in the Husker program under their belts The Longhorns five spring starters have The Longhorns should be able to able to overcome their youth to some extent because four of the spring starters Davis Anderson junior RG Antwan KirkHughes and junior RT Mike Williams all started last season and sophomore LG Derrick Dockery played often and well last year as a true freshman That means they know what it takes to win and have the experience to help them do it Brown did say he thinks the Longhorns can redshirt their offensive line recruits this year if we can avoid injuries That bodes well for the futu re But when the Horns start adays in early August Brown said there are fo ur problem areas where major improvements must be made for the Longhorns to be able to compete at the highest level and only one of them directly inv olves the offensive line First he said we need to do a better job of net punting Second we need to do a better job returning punts and kickoffs Third we need to do a better job of making fouryard plays consistently o n offense That will help with ball control and will help take the pressure o ff our passing game Fourth we need to do better job of getting a good pass rush out of our front four The Longhorns made a lot of progress in the spring in each of those areas but Brown said they have to keep working hard in each area to get even bett er Former walkon Ryan Long who handled the punting last season and Kris Stockton the Horns regular place kicker both worked hard on punting duri ng the spring and both were able to get good heighth and good distance on most of their kicks But look for incoming freshman punter Justin Smith to get a chance to win t he starting job Even more improvement was shown in the spring in the other three areas CB Ahmad Brooks showed promise as a punt returner in the spring and redshir t freshman RB Ivan Williams looked very good as a kickoff returner They should enable the Horns to be better in both kick return areas if the y improve as much during adays as they did in the spring practices Williams also is the main hope of showing improvement in problem area No doing a better job of making consistent fouryard gains He is a pounde r with speed and power and he can catch the ball too One important thing to remember about big running backs in addition to the obvious characteristics is the fact that offensive linemen tend to block better for them because they want to get out of their way If you ever played in the offensive line at any level and had a big running back step on the back of your legs because you didnt get out of his way youll know why they make an extra effort to get a good block when they kno w a pounder is coming through their area While the coaches saw some things they liked in those first three areas No getting a better pash rush out of the front four was a bigtime winner the spring and should get even better during the preseason practices Why For starters the best pair of tackles in all of college football retu rn in seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers Hampton is a returning AllAmerican and Rogers is rated even higher by the pro scouts Rogers is a great pass rusher and Hampton the teams best run stopper is a good one And sophomore end Cory Redding is a future AllAmerican who is an outstandi ng pass rusher and while the coaches arent satisfied the play of the guys a t the other end all three of them Jermain Anderson Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy are very good at rushing the passer Their problem is holdin g up against the run So while the Longhorns have work to do to reach the playing level the coaches demand they have a very good chance to do a lot better in all of t he categories Brown mentioned except net punting and they should be able to show some improvement there because it isnt too hard to improve on a ya rd net punting average that ranked th of teams playing Division I football Heres what Brown had to say on several other subjects Do you expect Major Applewhite to be ready to go full speed when practice starts in early August Doctors usually say it takes about nine months and he was operated on in midJanuary so hell only have about seven months until practice starts I dont know he said Ive been around long enough and Ive had five o f them knee operations myself to know that sometimes you seem to be ahead of schedule and then things seem to go a little slower There are still some questions and concerns there and well just have to wait and see After studying the film of the spring practices who were your most pleasant surprises There were a lot of pleasant surprises Beau Baker had a good spring and i s challenging Matt Anderson at center We expected redshirt freshman Artie Ellis to be pretty good but he really jumped out and showed he has the potential to help at wide receiver Ivan Williams probably came farther than anybody Matt Trissel had a good spr ing at fullback Leonard Davis had his best spring by far at offensive tackle On defense Jermain Anderson came back at pounds and in good health an d he looked good at end Were working to get him a little bigger D D Lewi s had by far his best spring at middle linebacker and Reed Boyd backing hi m up had a great spring too Quentin Jammer had a real good spring until he got hurt but he looked really good at corner Dakarai Pearson looked real good at free safety It wasnt any surprise but those two defensive tackles are real good Whats your biggest concern about having to play straight games without an open date Were going to have to play a lot of people We felt like we got worn down last year at the end of the season and weve worked to build better depth so we can play more people Were going to do that to try to keep our people fresher Lets talk about the chances of some of those heralded freshman wide receivers helping out early Well a guy can play there quicker Its less physical than most of the other positions The main thing will be learning how to handle the bumpandran coverage Were telling them to come in ready to compete for playing time Hall Will Transfer Redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall has asked for and has been granted an unconditional release and plans to transfer to another school this summer Hall an Austin Westlake product was the backup to sophomore Chris Simms during spring practice while junior Major Applewhite was recovering from major knee surgery He had a very good spring and was really adept at throwing on the run His departure will leave the Longhorns with just three scholarship quarterbacks this season Applewhite Simms and incoming freshman Chanc e Mock of The Woodlands And that is based on the assumption that Applewhites knee will be strong enough to allow him to be ready at the start of the season It was a difficult decision but one that I think is the best for me at th is time Hall said The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to b e a starter in the near future I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff have done for me but I think I will have a better opportunity to play soon er at another school Obviously we are disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring and we have been very pleased with his progress Brown said We wish him the very best and appreciate everything he has done for the University of Texas and its football program Revisiting the Offense After looking at the statistics of all of last seasons game I feel much better about the Texas offense Through the first games last season UT was averaging yards a game a nd had the leagues secondranked offense Texas also had been outgained only once in the win over Nebraska But QB Major Applewhite was healthy and WRs Kwame Cavil and Ryan Nunez were teaming up to outgain s dynamic duo of Wane McGarity and Cavil Jeremy Jones was also providing quality time at WR Against good defenses they were the straws that stirred the Longhorn offen se When the offensive meltdown occurred in the last three games injuries to Nunez and Jones Applewhites illness before the AM game and Cavils suspension before the Arkansas game kept them from ever being being all together again Fear of those potent weapons had kept teams from blitzing effectively but with one or more of those weapons missing in each of last three games team s were able to blitz too many people to block without fear of getting burned deep I doubt Texas could have beaten Nebraska a second time in one year but Id like to have played AM and Arkansas with everybody healthy Its true that those receivers are gone but TE Bo Scaife and a bigger faster corps of WRs will make allout blitzing much more dangerous for othe r teams Look for a return to those plusyard offensive averages in Its a Great Time to

with recruiting and other football news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Mihm Turns Pro Barnes Cupboard Far from Bare AllAmerica center Chris Mihm announced Friday he is passing up his senior season at Texas to follow his lifelong dream of playing in the NBA It was a tough choice because I love the program at UT but I believe Im doing what makes the most sense Mihm said Mihm who led the Longhorns in scoring rebounding and blocked shots last season is projected as a top five pick in the NBA draft next month If Mihm had returned for his senior season the Longhorns probably would have been a preseason top team but coach Rick Barnes cupboard if far from bare and they should be a top team without him Among the six returning lettermen are junior forward Chris Owens a pow er in the paint and senior guard Darren Kelly a sharpshooter and strong defender Other lettermen include sophomore forward William Wyatt sophomore guardfo rwa rd Chris Ogden sophomore guard Roosevelt Brown and senior guard Chris McColpin But Barnes ace in the hole is transfer guard Maurice Evans a junior dynamo who practiced with the team last season after averaging points a game as a sophomore at Wichita State Evans has been very impressive in practice and he like Mihm has bigtime NBA potential Barnes offense is not as wide open as Wichita States but look for Evans to average or points a game and be one of the teams b ig guns offensively and defensively next season Barnes also has six recruits coming in including heralded JC point guard Freddie Williams plus four national top recruits in forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville forward James Thomas of Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham Virginia swingman Brandon Mouton of Lafayette La and pound center Jason Klotz of Houston Klein Forest Guard Lawrence Williams announced plans to transfer two weeks ago and Barne s filled the scholarship by signing Royal Ivey a pound guard from Blair Academy a prep school in Blairstown N J Joe Montegna Iveys coach at Blair said the Longhorns picked up a real ge m He averaged points rebounds and assists for us Montegna said Hes a fine offensive player who is a true combo guard but hes much

Line Prospects Commit to Longhorns at Summer Camp Coach Mack Brown has revolutionized recruiting in Texas making June just a s big as January and he got the ball rolling again last week with pledges from the states best offensive lineman Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and another top oline prospect in Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls Scott is on all the national top lists and turned down offers from other schools such as Florida State Michigan and Tennessee to pick the Longhorns Scotts father Ray a former tight end with the New York Jets said Jonathan was very impressed with coach Brown and all the coaches and he told me he felt like the players were just one big family Scott also said his son wants to get a degree from Texas because he wants to live in Texas after he graduates Scott committed last Wednesday at the conclusion of UTs first full day summer camp It was the third straight summer he came to a Texas camp I just like everything about Texas Scott said adding that the coaches told him they want to work him at the key left tackle spot Allen who already had scholarship offers from Arkansas Duke Tulsa and South Carolina also committed at the camp Wednesday but didnt make it public until Thursday He has been a starter since his sophomore year Allen said he came to the camp hoping to get a scholarship offer and was eager to accept it when it was offered I knew this was where I wanted to go if the opportunity presented itself he said I like all the coaches and players at Texas and the facilities are great I feel like I can get a great education at Texas and just feel reall y comfortable with my decision to commit early Allen had taken unofficial visits to Texas Texas AM Notre Dame LSU and Baylor prior to coming to the Texas camp and he said Texas has great facilities its one of the top academic schools and it has an outstanding football program with great coaches and kids I just felt like it fit in better here than anywhere else Both Scott and Allen are honor students who already are full qualifiers Another UT camp is underway right now and there is good chance the Longhorns will get some more early commitments within the next several days Shane Simms of Tomball another of the states top offensive line prospects is attending this weeks camp and he wants to come to Texas so he is likely to commit if he gets an offer The Longhorns have zeroed in on two nationally recruited quarterbacks Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel a nd offered scholarships to each of them when they attended UT camps last week Both are and both are strongarmed passers with good mobility Rawls weighs about pounds and Nordgren weighs The Longhorns will sign at least one quarterback and it is hard to get two top ones in the same class so they probably are ready to take a commit fro m either Nordgren or Rawls and call it quits on quarterback recruiting this year Nordgren who had been looking primarily at Stanford and other outofstate schools said he is still wide open but he said Texas and Texas AM have moved to the top of his list right now Asked if there is a leader he said Im still pretty open but I like the two big Texas schools They both have outstanding coaching staffs He said the Longhorn coaches told me I was the No quarterback for them in the state I had an hour meeting with the coaches when I got there and the n I had another meeting with coach Brown after the camp was over The Longhorns also appear to be homing in on an instate running back and he is Anthony Johnson a pounder with speed from Jefferson Johnson told me he was coming to Austin last Saturday to talk to the UT coaches He said they had invited him to come for an unofficial visit On tape the thing that is most impressive about him is his speed at the point of attack He gets through a hole as quickly as anyone I have seen this year He has a great combination of speed and power and he should be a pounder after a year on a good college weight program The Longhorns probably will sign about recruits and or of them will be linemen if the coaches can get the ones they want Texas loaded up on speedy skill players in the last class but this class will be a true class of beef with six or seven offensive linemn and four o r five defensive linemen if things break right If linemen do get or of the scholarships look for the Horns to take one quarterback one or two running backs one tight end one or two wide receivers one or two linebackers and two or three defensive backs Weve already looked at the quarterback situation and the instate running back picture There are several outofstate bluechip running backs who ar e interested in Texas but they are long shots One of the running backs might be a fullback if the Horns can sign a great one like pound James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla He says he might visit Texas but FSU is the leader right now so he is a long shot for the Longhorns The tight end Texas is after is James Moses of Galena Park North Shore He is the best one in Texas and one of the best in the nation He told me he might come to a Texas camp and he said he likes the Longhorn s and the way they use their tight end The Longhorns are recruiting at least six wide receivers to try to fill two spots They are Armon Dorrough of Lancaster Brandon Jones of LibertyEylau Bennie Brazell of Houston Westbury Thomson Omboga of Grand Prairie Keith Mills of Garland and Lynzell Jackson of Union HS in Tempe Arizona All of them are speedsters and all of them have some interest in Texas The Longhorns loaded up on wide receivers last year but they have two senior wide receivers and would like to sign two recruits to replace them Derrick Johnson of Waco is the linebacker of choice for Texas and everyone else He is a great prospect with size and speed He came to the Texas minicamp last week and he says the Longhorns are slightly ahead of Florid a State and Texas AM Jonathon Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is another linebacker who is rising on the charts He is supposed to come to one of the Texas camps and he likes Texas and Penn State If the Longhorns can get Johnson and Jackson they will have hit it big at linebacker In the defensive backfield safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple is the main man Hes weighs and he ran a at the Austin Nike camp He likes Texas but Nebraska and Florida State are in the hunt too along with Texas AM Texas wants to sign two cornerbacks and there are some very good ones who are interested including Moses Harris of Dallas Carter Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes Dee Durham of Mansfield and Roger Ross of Denver Jefferson That brings us back to the lines There are more really topnotch offensive linemen in Texas than I have seen since in the years I have been doing this and luckily for the Longhorns that is their area of greatest need Texas has had depth problems in the offensive linemen ever since Brown and his staff arrived This is the year they should be able to sign as many top prospects as they need With Scott and Allen already committed there are four or five spots still open One of those will be filled by Alfio Randall if he graduates from Blinn JC and becomes academically eligible He signed with Texas out of Houston Yates but failed to qualify and went to Blinn He is on track to graduate in December and he says he will enroll in Texas in January Another possibility is Greg Barnum a former Killeen Ellison star who was being boomed for AllAmerica honors as a sophomore center at Tennessee before he abruptly quit the team last month citing homesickness But Phil Fulmer the Tennessee coach wont grant Barnum a release to atten d a Division I school That means he will have to pay his own way during the year he is sitting out at his new school if he picks another Division I school If he picks Stephen F Austin where his former coach at Killeen Ellison no w coaches he can go on scholarship immediately I talked to Barnum Sunday night and he said he was going to drive to Austin Monday to just look around at UT I know the coaches cant talk to me because he doesnt have a release but I just want to come over there and look around He said he has already visited Stephen F Austin and probably will make up his mind later this month about the course he will take Id like to go a big state school but Id also like to have a scholarship right away Barnum said I cant get a release from Tennessee so Ill have to decide what I want to do He said he will try to get some student loans and grants if he enrolls at U T as a nonscholarship student for the first year Under NCAA rules he will have to sit out a transfer year at his new school then will have three years of eligibility remaining Other offensive line prospects Texas is recruiting include Simms Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Roman Reeves of Livingston who all came to UT camps this summer plus Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower Wilkerson and Robinson join Scott on many of the national top lists Texas has a good shot at all of the offensive linemen I mentioned except Wilkerson and the Horns are on his radar screen now after being absent throughout the year The supply of offensive linemen is so plentiful that I think the UT coaches can sign five six or seven very good ones depending on how many they thin k they need The picture isnt as rosy on the defensive side of the ball DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is a great prospect and DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is very good Harris is strongly considering Texas but Derricks has no interest in the Longhorns at this point They are the only surefire top tackles I have found in the state at this point There are some big ends who might grow into tackles For example Simeon Jones of Houston Jones is and but he has just turned too Hes a year younger than most of the guys being recruited so he might get a lot bigger There also are some outofstate tackles who have a little interest in Texas including Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of New Orleans DeLaSalle Some other tackles who could emerge as seniors include Sharod McGowan of Waco and Jeremy Calahan of Pflugerville They both looked great at times as juniors and could become top prospects with more consistent performances as seniors The picture is brighter at end Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson Jones McKenzie Tilmon of Irving MacArthur Jamie Jackson of Andrews and Colin Allred of Dallas Hillcrest are very good instate prospects and the Horns are in on two outofstate DEs who were born in Texas Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn and Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal Its a Great Time to Subscribe

week It is believed to be a sprain Further tests will be conducted this week If it is a sprain he should be able to recover in time for the start of football practice in early July I f the injury turns out to be more severe it could cause him to miss some of the preseason practices The offseason conditioning workouts are going great and some of the offensive linemen appear to be dropping some pounds Junior Mike Williams and senior Cory Quye the two veterans who will battle for the right tackle slot both look more fit than I have ever seen them Williams still needs to drop a few more pounds so he can have the quickness to pick up speedy outside pass rushers but he is making progress Quye looks like he is ready to start the season right now Most of the key incoming freshmen are in Austin for the summer QB Chance Mock arrived last weekend and he looks like he has been following strength and conditioning mentor Mad Dog Maddens recommendations He appears to be about or pounds He looks like he could play linebacker Thats what happened to his dad Mike a great QB prospect from Longview more than years ago Mike signed with Texas Tech and was moved to linebacker where he starred a t Tech and earned some playing time in the NFL But that wont happen with Chance Mock He is a Michael Vicktype quarterback with a great arm quick feet and a sturdy body And even if he could play linebacker the Longhorns dont have enough bodie s at quarterback to even give that a thought DT Marcel Moses of Texas City has failed to qualify academically and will g o to Kilgore JC DT Sonny Davis

Texas Loses to LSU in World Series Plays FSU Tonight The Texas baseball made a huge leap from fourth in the Big to no worse than a tie for seventh in the country and it could be even better than that by the time you read this newsletter The Longhorns won their way into the College Baseball Series in Omaha by winning a subregional then a super regional in the last two weeks No seed LSU which won four national titles in the s burst the No seed Longhorns bubble at least temporarily with a thumping Saturday night in the first round of the World Series That threw Texas into the losers bracket and the Horns were to play Florid a State a loser to Southern Cal Saturday in an elimination game at pm tonight Monday If the Longhorns lose their season is over If they win they will play th e loser of the winners bracket game between LSU and USC If they win that game then they would have to beat the unbeaten team twice to win their division and set up a championship game against the winner of the other fourteam bracket That is a tall order because it means the Longhorns would have to win win five straight games to capture their fifth national title But whatever happens tonight or later in the tournament coach Augie Garrido and his Longhorns are back in Omaha for the first time since and UT baseball is back on track They did it by snapping out of a lateseason slump that saw them get shut out three times in their last six regular season games then go in the Big Tournament Because of their slow finish they were sent to a tough subregional in Tempe Arizona where the host team powerful Arizona State was a big favorite to advance The Longhorns opened by beating Creighton but then they fell to ASU to drop into the losers bracket It was a waste of an outstanding pitching performance by Beau Hale who held the powerful Sun Devils at bay for most of the day The Horns had to come back and play again that same day May and freshman Ray Clark saved the season by pitching a threehitter in an romp past Miami of Ohio It was an amazing performance by a true freshman and it also was a breakout game for the Longhorn hitters who had snoozed through most of May That meant Texas had to beat ASU on the Sun Devils home field twice on May after playing two games on May to advance But Clarks complete game gave Texas a chance because it kept the Horns fro m depleting their pitching staff before even getting to the final day Phil Seibel who missed almost the entire season with a sore arm allowed just five hits and one earned run in innings and Ben Emond drove in two runs and scored two more to power Texas to a win in the first game Freshman Ryan Hubele hit a threerun homer and Beau Hale put down a threat in the ninth to give the Horns the championship game by a score Hubele was the tourney MVP after hitting and batting in six runs Second baseman Tommy Nicholson shortstop Todd West outfielder Matt Rosenberg and pitchers Hale and Seibel made the AllTournament team The championship in Tempe earned the Horns a host spot in a super regional against Penn State Texas won the opener behind the pitching of D J Jones then mauled the Lions behind Hales threehit strikeout performance By the time most of you read this the Longhorns season might be over so lets look to the future Most of the key pitchers on this team will be gone next year but a few of them will return and Garrido and his staff have signed some great arms to replace the guys who are leaving They also have signed some big sticks that should enable the Horns to start winning a few slugfests They have rounded up an outstanding man recruiting class that gives them an excellent chance of being able to reload instead of undertaking a complete rebuilding job next baseball season They had a man class that was really good but they added No last weekend and that really was the frosting on the cake because he is Ben King a slugging hardthrowing lefthander from Grapevine who is leaving Alabama and coming to Texas after an outstanding freshman season After getting the Longhorns into the College Baseball World Series this year nothing would be sweeter than doing it again next year and this group of recruits just might help them accomplish that feat Of the recruits only two great prospects seem likely to sign They are catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo High School in suburban San Diego an d first baseman Jason Stokes of Coppell Heard hit last season with homers but he is more famous for his defensive prowess The pro scouts think he is the best overall catching prospect in several years and that prompted the Texas Rangers to draft him in the first round Stokes is an incredible power hitter who batted and blasted home runs last season and was chosen by the Florida Marlins with the first pick in the drafts second round Both are expected to receive offers that will be very difficult to pass up Both families say negotiations with their pro teams are in the early stages They also say contrary to published reports that no firm offers have been made Lets take a quick look at the other UT recruits Most of them signed in the early period but this is an uptodate look at how they performed in the justcompleted baseball season Late Transfer Bonus Baby Ben King will be eligible next season as a sophomore because you dont have to sit out a year in baseball when you transfer He was one of the states top recruits last year and picked Alabama over Texas He was an honorable mention freshman AllAmerica at Alabama after hitting home run s and batting as a designated hitter But King was a dominating pitcher in high school and he wants to pitch too He only pitched four innings at Alabama and that in a nutshell is why he will be a Longhorn next season As a lefty with good control and a mileanhour fastball hell get to pitch more than that at Texas in The Horns can use that powerful bat too With the low scholarship limits in baseball total chopped into various sizes pitcherhitter combos give double value Pitchers Albert Montes is a righthanded pitcher from El Paso who was the ace of the National JC World Series champs from Grayson JC in Denison He went and Grayson coach Tim Tadlock said Albert Montes should have been the MVP of the national tournament He won the opening game for us then came back to win two other games He has a fastball in the s to go along with a good curve but the thing that makes him so good is that he changes his arm angles a lot and gives the batters a lot of different looks Hes a real bulldog on the mound Montes pitched the championship game on two days rest and gave up three hits and one run while striking out He was the national tourneys Most Valuable Pitcher in and and won the title game bot h times Justin Simmons is a lefty with great control who led Duncanville to the Class A State Tournament for the third straight year He had a losing outing against The Woodlands in the state semifinals but wound up for the year In innings he

Dallas area he also was one of the leading hitters with a average and eight home runs He plays first base when he isnt on the mound Tim McGough is a righthander from Fort Worth Nolan who went last season with a ERA He pitched a shutout against Houston St Pius in the State TAPPS semifinals and struck out batters in innings while walking only eight batters He has been clocked as high as mph an d

played the last two years at Navarro JC He is a righthander who was the teams closer last season He notched saves and averaged two strikeouts per inning He has a consistent mph fast ball and has been clocked as high as He also played shortstop for Navarro and batted with five home runs Chris Neuman is a lefthanded pitcherslugger who could be the comeback kid of the year As a junior he had a live fastball in the low s struck out in innings and had an ERA But he hurt his shoulder late in the season and had arthroscopic surgery He did not pitch his senio r year but hit with six home runs His father Harvey told me the doctors think his shoulder is fine now and he should be able to resume pitching at Texas with no ill effects from the surgery If he does recover completely a lefthander with good control and a live mph fastball is a thing of beauty when he plays for you and a terror to behold when he plays for the other team Gerrit Simpson is a righthanded pitcherfirst baseman from Claremore Okla who played the last two years at Connors JC in Oklahoma He was as a pitcher last season who averaged more than strikeouts pe r inning and allowed only two walks per game His fast ball is consistent around and has been clocked as high as He also has a good curve ball He hit too Derek Denman is a righthander from Euless Trinity who was the closer on Graysons JC title team He had eight saves In addition to a liv e fastball that ranges from to miles per hour he also has a very good curve and an improving slider to go along with excellent control Derrick Grigsby is a righthander who led Marshall deep into the Class A state playoffs He went with a ERA and pitched a shutout against the eventual state finalist team from The Woodlands in the state playoffs but the Mavericks lost the other two games in the series Yeah they beat us twice by one run Grigsby told me That really hurt His fast ball has been clocked as high as miles per hour and he is consistently in the mph range Eugene Espineli is a lefthander who went with a ERA fo r Katy Taylor He struck out and walked only in innings His best pitches are a changeup and a fastball in the mid s John Zamora is a native of

MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetDISO XMailer AOL for Mac PostGM sub XMozillaStatus Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No May Brown Says Offensive Line Much Improved Cites Other Problems Heading into aDays Coach Mack Brown says he and his assistant coaches have thoroughly reviewed the tapes of the Longhorns spring practices and have concluded it was a very productive period The offensive line has received much of the blame for the lateseason Longhorn swoon last year but Brown says the offensive linemen as a group showed a lot more maturity and perseverance in the spring I think the offensive line improved a lot he told me in an interview las t week Asked what he thought prompted the improvement he said The embarrassment they felt leaving the Cotton Bowl and the fact that they have been together a year more While he didnt elaborate on the maturity question it is worth noting that four of the five offensive linemen who started in the spring have never redshirted The reason they never redshirted is the lack of depth in the offensive lin e when they got here which forced Brown to play most of the linemen when the y were true freshmen At Nebraska which has been the top program in the Big year in and year out all offensive linemen redshirt and most of them dont start until thei r fourth year when they are redshirt juniors Applying that yardstick to the Texas offensive line none of the four spri ng starters would have started last year and only senior LT Leonard Davis and junior center Matt Anderson would start this year because they are entering their fourth seasons There are exceptions even at Nebraska because their center last season wa s a thirdyear sophomore but the Huskers and the other teams who seem t o always be in the hunt for the national championship go mostly with fourthandfifthyear players redshirted juniors and seniors in their offensive lines The five offensive line starters at Nebraska this spring already have seasons in the Husker program under their belts The Longhorns five spring starters have The Longhorns should be able to able to overcome their youth to some extent because four of the spring starters Davis Anderson junior RG Antwan KirkHughes and junior RT Mike Williams all started last season and sophomore LG Derrick Dockery played often and well last year as a true freshman That means they know what it takes to win and have the experience to help them do it Brown did say he thinks the Longhorns can redshirt their offensive line recruits this year if we can avoid injuries That bodes well for the futu re But when the Horns start adays in early August Brown said there are fo ur problem areas where major improvements must be made for the Longhorns to be able to compete at the highest level and only one of them directly inv olves the offensive line First he said we need to do a better job of net punting Second we need to do a better job returning punts and kickoffs Third we need to do a better job of making fouryard plays consistently o n offense That will help with ball control and will help take the pressure o ff our passing game Fourth we need to do better job of getting a good pass rush out of our front four The Longhorns made a lot of progress in the spring in each of those areas but Brown said they have to keep working hard in each area to get even bett er Former walkon Ryan Long who handled the punting last season and Kris Stockton the Horns regular place kicker both worked hard on punting duri ng the spring and both were able to get good heighth and good distance on most of their kicks But look for incoming freshman punter Justin Smith to get a chance to win t he starting job Even more improvement was shown in the spring in the other three areas CB Ahmad Brooks showed promise as a punt returner in the spring and redshir t freshman RB Ivan Williams looked very good as a kickoff returner They should enable the Horns to be better in both kick return areas if the y improve as much during adays as they did in the spring practices Williams also is the main hope of showing improvement in problem area No doing a better job of making consistent fouryard gains He is a pounde r with speed and power and he can catch the ball too One important thing to remember about big running backs in addition to the obvious characteristics is the fact that offensive linemen tend to block better for them because they want to get out of their way If you ever played in the offensive line at any level and had a big running back step on the back of your legs because you didnt get out of his way youll know why they make an extra effort to get a good block when they kno w a pounder is coming through their area While the coaches saw some things they liked in those first three areas No getting a better pash rush out of the front four was a bigtime winner the spring and should get even better during the preseason practices Why For starters the best pair of tackles in all of college football retu rn in seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers Hampton is a returning AllAmerican and Rogers is rated even higher by the pro scouts Rogers is a great pass rusher and Hampton the teams best run stopper is a good one And sophomore end Cory Redding is a future AllAmerican who is an outstandi ng pass rusher and while the coaches arent satisfied the play of the guys a t the other end all three of them Jermain Anderson Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy are very good at rushing the passer Their problem is holdin g up against the run So while the Longhorns have work to do to reach the playing level the coaches demand they have a very good chance to do a lot better in all of t he categories Brown mentioned except net punting and they should be able to show some improvement there because it isnt too hard to improve on a ya rd net punting average that ranked th of teams playing Division I football Heres what Brown had to say on several other subjects Do you expect Major Applewhite to be ready to go full speed when practice starts in early August Doctors usually say it takes about nine months and he was operated on in midJanuary so hell only have about seven months until practice starts I dont know he said Ive been around long enough and Ive had five o f them knee operations myself to know that sometimes you seem to be ahead of schedule and then things seem to go a little slower There are still some questions and concerns there and well just have to wait and see After studying the film of the spring practices who were your most pleasant surprises There were a lot of pleasant surprises Beau Baker had a good spring and i s challenging Matt Anderson at center We expected redshirt freshman Artie Ellis to be pretty good but he really jumped out and showed he has the potential to help at wide receiver Ivan Williams probably came farther than anybody Matt Trissel had a good spr ing at fullback Leonard Davis had his best spring by far at offensive tackle On defense Jermain Anderson came back at pounds and in good health an d he looked good at end Were working to get him a little bigger D D Lewi s had by far his best spring at middle linebacker and Reed Boyd backing hi m up had a great spring too Quentin Jammer had a real good spring until he got hurt but he looked really good at corner Dakarai Pearson looked real good at free safety It wasnt any surprise but those two defensive tackles are real good Whats your biggest concern about having to play straight games without an open date Were going to have to play a lot of people We felt like we got worn down last year at the end of the season and weve worked to build better depth so we can play more people Were going to do that to try to keep our people fresher Lets talk about the chances of some of those heralded freshman wide receivers helping out early Well a guy can play there quicker Its less physical than most of the other positions The main thing will be learning how to handle the bumpandran coverage Were telling them to come in ready to compete for playing time Hall Will Transfer Redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall has asked for and has been granted an unconditional release and plans to transfer to another school this summer Hall an Austin Westlake product was the backup to sophomore Chris Simms during spring practice while junior Major Applewhite was recovering from major knee surgery He had a very good spring and was really adept at throwing on the run His departure will leave the Longhorns with just three scholarship quarterbacks this season Applewhite Simms and incoming freshman Chanc e Mock of The Woodlands And that is based on the assumption that Applewhites knee will be strong enough to allow him to be ready at the start of the season It was a difficult decision but one that I think is the best for me at th is time Hall said The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to b e a starter in the near future I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff have done for me but I think I will have a better opportunity to play soon er at another school Obviously we are disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring and we have been very pleased with his progress Brown said We wish him the very best and appreciate everything he has done for the University of Texas and its football program Revisiting the Offense After looking at the statistics of all of last seasons game I feel much better about the Texas offense Through the first games last season UT was averaging yards a game a nd had the leagues secondranked offense Texas also had been outgained only once in the win over Nebraska But QB Major Applewhite was healthy and WRs Kwame Cavil and Ryan Nunez were teaming up to outgain s dynamic duo of Wane McGarity and Cavil Jeremy Jones was also providing quality time at WR Against good defenses they were the straws that stirred the Longhorn offen se When the offensive meltdown occurred in the last three games injuries to Nunez and Jones Applewhites illness before the AM game and Cavils suspension before the Arkansas game kept them from ever being being all together again Fear of those potent weapons had kept teams from blitzing effectively but with one or more of those weapons missing in each of last three games team s were able to blitz too many people to block without fear of getting burned deep I doubt Texas could have beaten Nebraska a second time in one year but Id like to have played AM and Arkansas with everybody healthy Its true that those receivers are gone but TE Bo Scaife and a bigger faster corps of WRs will make allout blitzing much more dangerous for othe r teams Look for a return to those plusyard offensive averages in Its a Great Time to

with recruiting and other football news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Mihm Turns Pro Barnes Cupboard Far from Bare AllAmerica center Chris Mihm announced Friday he is passing up his senior season at Texas to follow his lifelong dream of playing in the NBA It was a tough choice because I love the program at UT but I believe Im doing what makes the most sense Mihm said Mihm who led the Longhorns in scoring rebounding and blocked shots last season is projected as a top five pick in the NBA draft next month If Mihm had returned for his senior season the Longhorns probably would have been a preseason top team but coach Rick Barnes cupboard if far from bare and they should be a top team without him Among the six returning lettermen are junior forward Chris Owens a pow er in the paint and senior guard Darren Kelly a sharpshooter and strong defender Other lettermen include sophomore forward William Wyatt sophomore guardfo rwa rd Chris Ogden sophomore guard Roosevelt Brown and senior guard Chris McColpin But Barnes ace in the hole is transfer guard Maurice Evans a junior dynamo who practiced with the team last season after averaging points a game as a sophomore at Wichita State Evans has been very impressive in practice and he like Mihm has bigtime NBA potential Barnes offense is not as wide open as Wichita States but look for Evans to average or points a game and be one of the teams b ig guns offensively and defensively next season Barnes also has six recruits coming in including heralded JC point guard Freddie Williams plus four national top recruits in forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville forward James Thomas of Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham Virginia swingman Brandon Mouton of Lafayette La and pound center Jason Klotz of Houston Klein Forest Guard Lawrence Williams announced plans to transfer two weeks ago and Barne s filled the scholarship by signing Royal Ivey a pound guard from Blair Academy a prep school in Blairstown N J Joe Montegna Iveys coach at Blair said the Longhorns picked up a real ge m He averaged points rebounds and assists for us Montegna said Hes a fine offensive player who is a true combo guard but hes much bett er on defense Hes the best defensive player by far that Ive ever coached and Ive coached in the college ranks Montegna said

To Date Monday June AM Subject True Orange June Part Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and faxemail service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No June Two of States Top Offensive Line Prospects Commit to Longhorns at Summer Camp Coach Mack Brown has revolutionized recruiting in Texas making June just a s big as January and he got the ball rolling again last week with pledges from the states best offensive lineman Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and another top oline prospect in Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls Scott is on all the national top lists and turned down offers from other schools such as Florida State Michigan and Tennessee to pick the Longhorns Scotts father Ray a former tight end with the New York Jets said Jonathan was very impressed with coach Brown and all the coaches and he told me he felt like the players were just one big family Scott also said his son wants to get a degree from Texas because he wants to live in Texas after he graduates Scott committed last Wednesday at the conclusion of UTs first full day summer camp It was the third straight summer he came to a Texas camp I just like everything about Texas Scott said adding that the coaches told him they want to work him at the key left tackle spot Allen who already had scholarship offers from Arkansas Duke Tulsa and South Carolina also committed at the camp Wednesday but didnt make it public until Thursday He has been a starter since his sophomore year Allen said he came to the camp hoping to get a scholarship offer and was eager to accept it when it was offered I knew this was where I wanted to go if the opportunity presented itself he said I like all the coaches and players at Texas and the facilities are great I feel like I can get a great education at Texas and just feel reall y comfortable with my decision to commit early Allen had taken unofficial visits to Texas Texas AM Notre Dame LSU and Baylor prior to coming to the Texas camp and he said Texas has great facilities its one of the top academic schools and it has an outstanding football program with great coaches and kids I just felt like it fit in better here than anywhere else Both Scott and Allen are honor students who already are full qualifiers Another UT camp is underway right now and there is good chance the Longhorns will get some more early commitments within the next several days Shane Simms of Tomball another of the states top offensive line prospects is attending this weeks camp and he wants to come to Texas so he is likely to commit if he gets an offer The Longhorns have zeroed in on two nationally recruited quarterbacks Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel a nd offered scholarships to each of them when they attended UT camps last week Both are and both are strongarmed passers with good mobility Rawls weighs about pounds and Nordgren weighs The Longhorns will sign at least one quarterback and it is hard to get two top ones in the same class so they probably are ready to take a commit fro m either Nordgren or Rawls and call it quits on quarterback recruiting this year Nordgren who had been looking primarily at Stanford and other outofstate schools said he is still wide open but he said Texas and Texas AM have moved to the top of his list right now Asked if there is a leader he said Im still pretty open but I like the two big Texas schools They both have outstanding coaching staffs He said the Longhorn coaches told me I was the No quarterback for them in the state I had an hour meeting with the coaches when I got there and the n I had another meeting with coach Brown after the camp was over The Longhorns also appear to be homing in on an instate running back and he is Anthony Johnson a pounder with speed from Jefferson Johnson told me he was coming to Austin last Saturday to talk to the UT coaches He said they had invited him to come for an unofficial visit On tape the thing that is most impressive about him is his speed at the point of attack He gets through a hole as quickly as anyone I have seen this year He has a great combination of speed and power and he should be a pounder after a year on a good college weight program The Longhorns probably will sign about recruits and or of them will be linemen if the coaches can get the ones they want Texas loaded up on speedy skill players in the last class but this class will be a true class of beef with six or seven offensive linemn and four o r five defensive linemen if things break right If linemen do get or of the scholarships look for the Horns to take one quarterback one or two running backs one tight end one or two wide receivers one or two linebackers and two or three defensive backs Weve already looked at the quarterback situation and the instate running back picture There are several outofstate bluechip running backs who ar e interested in Texas but they are long shots One of the running backs might be a fullback if the Horns can sign a great one like pound James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla He says he might visit Texas but FSU is the leader right now so he is a long shot for the Longhorns The tight end Texas is after is James Moses of Galena Park North Shore He is the best one in Texas and one of the best in the nation He told me he might come to a Texas camp and he said he likes the Longhorn s and the way they use their tight end The Longhorns are recruiting at least six wide receivers to try to fill two spots They are Armon Dorrough of Lancaster Brandon Jones of LibertyEylau Bennie Brazell of Houston Westbury Thomson Omboga of Grand Prairie Keith Mills of Garland and Lynzell Jackson of Union HS in Tempe Arizona All of them are speedsters and all of them have some interest in Texas The Longhorns loaded up on wide receivers last year but they have two senior wide receivers and would like to sign two recruits to replace them Derrick Johnson of Waco is the linebacker of choice for Texas and everyone else He is a great prospect with size and speed He came to the Texas minicamp last week and he says the Longhorns are slightly ahead of Florid a State and Texas AM Jonathon Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is another linebacker who is rising on the charts He is supposed to come to one of the Texas camps and he likes Texas and Penn State If the Longhorns can get Johnson and Jackson they will have hit it big at linebacker In the defensive backfield safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple is the main man Hes weighs and he ran a at the Austin Nike camp He likes Texas but Nebraska and Florida State are in the hunt too along with Texas AM Texas wants to sign two cornerbacks and there are some very good ones who are interested including Moses Harris of Dallas Carter Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes Dee Durham of Mansfield and Roger Ross of Denver Jefferson That brings us back to the lines There are more really topnotch offensive linemen in Texas than I have seen since in the years I have been doing this and luckily for the Longhorns that is their area of greatest need Texas has had depth problems in the offensive linemen ever since Brown and his staff arrived This is the year they should be able to sign as many top prospects as they need With Scott and Allen already committed there are four or five spots still open One of those will be filled by Alfio Randall if he graduates from Blinn JC and becomes academically eligible He signed with Texas out of Houston Yates but failed to qualify and went to Blinn He is on track to graduate in December and he says he will enroll in Texas in January Another possibility is Greg Barnum a former Killeen Ellison star who was being boomed for AllAmerica honors as a sophomore center at Tennessee before he abruptly quit the team last month citing homesickness But Phil Fulmer the Tennessee coach wont grant Barnum a release to atten d a Division I school That means he will have to pay his own way during the year he is sitting out at his new school if he picks another Division I school If he picks Stephen F Austin where his former coach at Killeen Ellison no w coaches he can go on scholarship immediately I talked to Barnum Sunday night and he said he was going to drive to Austin Monday to just look around at UT I know the coaches cant talk to me because he doesnt have a release but I just want to come over there and look around He said he has already visited Stephen F Austin and probably will make up his mind later this month about the course he will take Id like to go a big state school but Id also like to have a scholarship right away Barnum said I cant get a release from Tennessee so Ill have to decide what I want to do He said he will try to get some student loans and grants if he enrolls at U T as a nonscholarship student for the first year Under NCAA rules he will have to sit out a transfer year at his new school then will have three years of eligibility remaining Other offensive line prospects Texas is recruiting include Simms Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Roman Reeves of Livingston who all came to UT camps this summer plus Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower Wilkerson and Robinson join Scott on many of the national top lists Texas has a good shot at all of the offensive linemen I mentioned except Wilkerson and the Horns are on his radar screen now after being absent throughout the year The supply of offensive linemen is so plentiful that I think the UT coaches can sign five six or seven very good ones depending on how many they thin k they need The picture isnt as rosy on the defensive side of the ball DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is a great prospect and DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is very good Harris is strongly considering Texas but Derricks has no interest in the Longhorns at this point They are the only surefire top tackles I have found in the state at this point There are some big ends who might grow into tackles For example Simeon Jones of Houston Jones is and but he has just turned too Hes a year younger than most of the guys being recruited so he might get a lot bigger There also are some outofstate tackles who have a little interest in Texas including Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of New Orleans DeLaSalle Some other tackles who could emerge as seniors include Sharod McGowan of Waco and Jeremy Calahan of Pflugerville They both looked great at times as juniors and could become top prospects with more consistent performances as seniors The picture is brighter at end Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson Jones McKenzie Tilmon of Irving MacArthur Jamie Jackson of Andrews and Colin Allred of Dallas Hillcrest are very good instate prospects and the Horns are in on two outofstate DEs who were born in Texas Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn and Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal Its a Great Time to Subscribe

week It is believed to be a sprain Further tests will be conducted this week If it is a sprain he should be able to recover in time for the start of football practice in early July I f the injury turns out to be more severe it could cause him to miss some of the preseason practices The offseason conditioning workouts are going great and some of the offensive linemen appear to be dropping some pounds Junior Mike Williams and senior Cory Quye the two veterans who will battle for the right tackle slot both look more fit than I have ever seen them Williams still needs to drop a few more pounds so he can have the quickness to pick up speedy outside pass rushers but he is making progress Quye looks like he is ready to start the season right now Most of the key incoming freshmen are in Austin for the summer QB Chance Mock arrived last weekend and he looks like he has been following strength and conditioning mentor Mad Dog Maddens recommendations He appears to be about or pounds He looks like he could play linebacker Thats what happened to his dad Mike a great QB prospect from Longview more than years ago Mike signed with Texas Tech and was moved to linebacker where he starred a t Tech and earned some playing time in the NFL But that wont happen with Chance Mock He is a Michael Vicktype quarterback with a great arm quick feet and a sturdy body And even if he could play

Texas Loses to LSU in World Series Plays FSU Tonight The Texas baseball made a huge leap from fourth in the Big to no worse than a tie for seventh in the country and it could be even better than that by the time you read this newsletter The Longhorns won their way into the College Baseball Series in Omaha by winning a subregional then a super regional in the last two weeks No seed LSU which won four national titles in the s burst the No seed Longhorns bubble at least temporarily with a thumping Saturday night in the first round of the World Series That threw Texas into the losers bracket and the Horns were to play Florid a State a loser to Southern Cal Saturday in an elimination game at pm tonight Monday If the Longhorns lose their season is over If they win they will play th e loser of the winners bracket game between LSU and USC If they win that game then they would have to beat the unbeaten team twice to win their division and set up a championship game against the winner of the other fourteam bracket That is a tall order because it means the Longhorns would have to win win five straight games to capture their fifth national title But whatever happens tonight or later in the tournament coach Augie Garrido and his Longhorns are back in Omaha for the first time since and UT baseball is back on track They did it by snapping out of a lateseason slump that saw them get shut out three times in their last six regular season games then go in the Big Tournament Because of their slow finish they were sent to a tough subregional in Tempe Arizona where the host team powerful Arizona State was a big favorite to advance The Longhorns opened by beating Creighton but then they fell to ASU to drop into the losers bracket It was a waste of an outstanding pitching performance by Beau Hale who held the powerful Sun Devils at bay for most of the day The Horns had to come back and play again that same day May and freshman Ray Clark saved the season by pitching a threehitter in an romp past Miami of Ohio It was an amazing performance by a true freshman and it also was a breakout game for the Longhorn hitters who had snoozed through most of May That meant Texas had to beat ASU on the Sun Devils home field twice on May after playing two games on May to advance But Clarks complete game gave Texas a chance because it kept the Horns fro m depleting their pitching staff before even getting to the final day Phil Seibel who missed almost the entire season with a sore arm allowed just five hits and one earned run in innings and Ben Emond drove in two runs and scored two more to power Texas to a win in the first game Freshman Ryan Hubele hit a threerun homer and Beau Hale put down a threat in the ninth to give the Horns the championship game by a score Hubele was the tourney MVP after hitting and batting in six runs Second baseman Tommy Nicholson shortstop Todd West outfielder Matt Rosenberg and pitchers Hale and Seibel made the AllTournament team The championship in Tempe earned the Horns a host spot in a super regional against Penn State Texas won the opener behind the pitching of D J Jones then mauled the Lions behind Hales threehit strikeout performance By the time most of you read this the Longhorns season might be over so lets look to the future Most of the key pitchers on this team will be gone next year but a few of them will return and Garrido and his staff have signed some great arms to replace the guys who are leaving They also have signed some big sticks that should enable the Horns to start winning a few slugfests They have rounded up an outstanding man recruiting class that gives them an excellent chance of being able to reload instead of undertaking a complete rebuilding job next baseball season They had a man class that was really good but they added No last weekend and that really was the frosting on the cake because he is Ben King a slugging hardthrowing lefthander from Grapevine who is leaving Alabama and coming to Texas after an outstanding freshman season After getting the Longhorns into the College Baseball World Series this year nothing would be sweeter than doing it again next year and this group of recruits just might help them accomplish that feat Of the recruits only two great prospects seem likely to sign They are catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo High School in suburban San Diego an d first baseman Jason Stokes of Coppell Heard hit last season with homers but he is more famous for his defensive prowess The pro scouts think he is the best overall catching prospect in several years and that prompted the Texas Rangers to draft him in the first round Stokes is an incredible power hitter who batted and blasted home runs last season and was chosen by the Florida Marlins with the first pick in the drafts second round Both are expected to receive offers that will be very difficult to pass up Both families say negotiations with their pro teams are in the early stages They also say contrary to published reports that no firm offers have been made Lets take a quick look at the other UT recruits Most of them signed in the early period but this is an uptodate look at how they performed in the justcompleted baseball season Late Transfer Bonus Baby Ben King will be eligible next season as a sophomore because you dont have to sit out a year in baseball when you transfer He was one of the states top recruits last year and picked Alabama over Texas He was an honorable mention freshman AllAmerica at Alabama after hitting home run s and batting as a designated hitter But King was a dominating pitcher in high school and he wants to pitch too He only pitched four innings at Alabama and that in a nutshell is why he will be a Longhorn next season As a lefty with good control and a mileanhour fastball hell get to pitch more than that at Texas in The Horns can use that powerful bat too With the low scholarship limits in baseball total chopped into various sizes pitcherhitter combos give double value Pitchers Albert Montes is a righthanded pitcher from El Paso who was the ace of the National JC World Series champs from Grayson JC in Denison He went and Grayson coach Tim Tadlock said Albert Montes should have been the MVP of the national tournament He won the opening game for us then came back to win two other games He has a fastball in the s to go along with a good curve but the thing that makes him so good is that he changes his arm angles a lot and gives the batters a lot of different looks Hes a real bulldog on the mound Montes pitched the championship game on two days rest and gave up three hits and one run while striking out He was the national tourneys Most Valuable Pitcher in and and won the title game bot h times Justin Simmons is a lefty with great control who led Duncanville to the Class A State Tournament for the third straight year He had a losing outing against The Woodlands in the state semifinals but wound up for the year In innings he

Dallas area he also was one of the leading hitters with a average and eight home runs He plays first base when he isnt on the mound Tim McGough is a righthander from Fort Worth Nolan who went last season with a ERA He pitched a shutout against Houston St Pius in the State TAPPS semifinals and struck out batters in innings while walking only eight batters He has been clocked as high as mph an d

clocked as high as He also played shortstop for Navarro and batted with five home runs Chris Neuman is a lefthanded pitcherslugger who could be the comeback kid of the year As a junior he had a live fastball in the low s struck out in innings and had an ERA But he hurt his shoulder late in the season and had arthroscopic surgery He did not pitch his senio r year but hit with six home runs His father Harvey told me the doctors think his shoulder is fine now and he should be able to resume pitching at Texas with no ill effects from the surgery If he does recover completely a lefthander with good control and a live mph fastball is a thing of beauty when he plays for you and a terror to behold when he plays for the other team Gerrit Simpson is a righthanded pitcherfirst baseman from Claremore Okla who played the last two years at Connors JC in Oklahoma He was as a pitcher last season who averaged more than strikeouts pe r inning and allowed only two walks per game His fast ball is consistent around and has been clocked as high as He also has a good curve ball He hit too Derek Denman is a righthander from Euless Trinity who was the closer on Graysons JC title team He had

the other two games in the series Yeah they beat us twice by one run Grigsby told me That really hurt His fast ball has been clocked as high as miles per hour and he is consistently in the mph range

MIMEVersion ContentType textplain charsetDISO XMailer AOL for Mac PostGM sub XMozillaStatus Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No May Brown Says Offensive Line Much Improved Cites Other Problems Heading into aDays Coach Mack Brown says he and his assistant coaches have thoroughly reviewed the tapes of the Longhorns spring practices and have concluded it was a very productive period The offensive line has received much of the blame for the lateseason Longhorn swoon last year but Brown says the offensive linemen as a group showed a lot more maturity and perseverance in the spring I think the offensive line improved a lot he told me in an interview las t week Asked what he thought prompted the improvement he said The embarrassment they felt leaving the Cotton Bowl and the fact that they have been together a year more While he didnt elaborate on the maturity question it is worth noting that four of the five offensive linemen who started in the spring have never redshirted The reason they never redshirted is the lack of depth in the offensive lin e when they got here which forced Brown to play most of the linemen when the y were true freshmen At Nebraska which has been the top program in the Big year in and year out all offensive linemen redshirt and most of them dont start until thei r fourth year when they are redshirt juniors Applying that yardstick to the Texas offensive line none of the four spri ng starters would have started last year and only senior LT Leonard Davis and junior center Matt Anderson would start this year because they are entering their fourth seasons There are exceptions even at Nebraska because their center last season wa s a thirdyear sophomore but the Huskers and the other teams who seem t o always be in the hunt for the national championship go mostly with fourthandfifthyear players redshirted juniors and seniors in their offensive lines The five offensive line starters at Nebraska this spring already have seasons in the Husker program under their belts The Longhorns five spring starters have The Longhorns should be able to able to overcome their youth to some extent because four of the spring starters Davis Anderson junior RG Antwan KirkHughes and junior RT Mike Williams all started last season and sophomore LG Derrick Dockery played often and well last year as a true freshman That means they know what it takes to win and have the experience to help them do it Brown did say he thinks the Longhorns can redshirt their offensive line recruits this year if we can avoid injuries That bodes well for the futu re But when the Horns start adays in early August Brown said there are fo ur problem areas where major improvements must be made for the Longhorns to be able to compete at the highest level and only one of them directly inv olves the offensive line First he said we need to do a better job of net punting Second we need to do a better job returning punts and kickoffs Third we need to do a better job of making fouryard plays consistently o n offense That will help with ball control and will help take the pressure o ff our passing game Fourth we need to do better job of getting a good pass rush out of our front four The Longhorns made a lot of progress in the spring in each of those areas but Brown said they have to keep working hard in each area to get even bett er Former walkon Ryan Long who handled the punting last season and Kris Stockton the Horns regular place kicker both worked hard on punting duri ng the spring and both were able to get good heighth and good distance on most of their kicks But look for incoming freshman punter Justin Smith to get a chance to win t he starting job Even more improvement was shown in the spring in the other three areas CB Ahmad Brooks showed promise as a punt returner in the spring and redshir t freshman RB Ivan Williams looked very good as a kickoff returner They should enable the Horns to be better in both kick return areas if the y improve as much during adays as they did in the spring practices Williams also is the main hope of showing improvement in problem area No doing a better job of making consistent fouryard gains He is a pounde r with speed and power and he can catch the ball too One important thing to remember about big running backs in addition to the obvious characteristics is the fact that offensive linemen tend to block better for them because they want to get out of their way If you ever played in the offensive line at any level and had a big running back step on the back of your legs because you didnt get out of his way youll know why they make an extra effort to get a good block when they kno w a pounder is coming through their area While the coaches saw some things they liked in those first three areas No getting a better pash rush out of the front four was a bigtime winner the spring and should get even better during the preseason practices Why For starters the best pair of tackles in all of college football retu rn in seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers Hampton is a returning AllAmerican and Rogers is rated even higher by the pro scouts Rogers is a great pass rusher and Hampton the teams best run stopper is a good one And sophomore end Cory Redding is a future AllAmerican who is an outstandi ng pass rusher and while the coaches arent satisfied the play of the guys a t the other end all three of them Jermain Anderson Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy are very good at rushing the passer Their problem is holdin g up against the run So while the Longhorns have work to do to reach the playing level the coaches demand they have a very good chance to do a lot better in all of t he categories Brown mentioned except net punting and they should be able to show some improvement there because it isnt too hard to improve on a ya rd net punting average that ranked th of teams playing Division I football Heres what Brown had to say on several other subjects Do you expect Major Applewhite to be ready to go full speed when practice starts in early August Doctors usually say it takes about nine months and he was operated on in midJanuary so hell only have about seven months until practice starts I dont know he said Ive been around long enough and Ive had five o f them knee operations myself to know that sometimes you seem to be ahead of schedule and then things seem to go a little slower There are still some questions and concerns there and well just have to wait and see After studying the film of the spring practices who were your most pleasant surprises There were a lot of pleasant surprises Beau Baker had a good spring and i s challenging Matt Anderson at center We expected redshirt freshman Artie Ellis to be pretty good but he really jumped out and showed he has the potential to help at wide receiver Ivan Williams probably came farther than anybody Matt Trissel had a good spr ing at fullback Leonard Davis had his best spring by far at offensive tackle On defense Jermain Anderson came back at pounds and in good health an d he looked good at end Were working to get him a little bigger D D Lewi s had by far his best spring at middle linebacker and Reed Boyd backing hi m up had a great spring too Quentin Jammer had a real good spring until he got hurt but he looked really good at corner Dakarai Pearson looked real good at free safety It wasnt any surprise but those two defensive tackles are real good Whats your biggest concern about having to play straight games without an open date Were going to have to play a lot of people We felt like we got worn down last year at the end of the season and weve worked to build better depth so we can play more people Were going to do that to try to keep our people fresher Lets talk about the chances of some of those heralded freshman wide receivers helping out early Well a guy can play there quicker Its less physical than most of the other positions The main thing will be learning how to handle the bumpandran coverage Were telling them to come in ready to compete for playing time Hall Will Transfer Redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall has asked for and has been granted an unconditional release and plans to transfer to another school this summer Hall an Austin Westlake product was the backup to sophomore Chris Simms during spring practice while junior Major Applewhite was recovering from major knee surgery He had a very good spring and was really adept at throwing on the run His departure will leave the Longhorns with just three scholarship quarterbacks this season Applewhite Simms and incoming freshman Chanc e Mock of The Woodlands And that is based on the assumption that Applewhites knee will be strong enough to allow him to be ready at the start of the season It was a difficult decision but one that I think is the best for me at th is time Hall said The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to b e a starter in the near future I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff have done for me but I think I will have a better opportunity to play soon er at another school Obviously we are disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring and we have been very pleased with his progress Brown said We wish him the very best and appreciate everything he has done for the University of Texas and its football program Revisiting the Offense After looking at the statistics of all of last seasons game I feel much better about the Texas offense Through the first games last season UT was averaging yards a game a nd had the leagues secondranked offense Texas also had been outgained only once in the win over Nebraska But QB Major Applewhite was healthy and WRs Kwame Cavil and Ryan Nunez were teaming up to outgain s dynamic duo of Wane McGarity and Cavil Jeremy Jones was also providing quality time at WR Against good defenses they were the straws that stirred the Longhorn offen se When the offensive meltdown occurred in the last three games injuries to Nunez and Jones Applewhites illness before the AM game and Cavils suspension before the Arkansas game kept them from ever being being all together again Fear of those potent weapons had kept teams from blitzing effectively but with one or more of those weapons missing in each of last three games team s were able to blitz too many people to block without fear of getting burned deep I doubt Texas could have beaten Nebraska a second time in one year but Id like to have played AM and Arkansas with everybody healthy Its true that those receivers are gone but TE Bo Scaife and a bigger faster corps of WRs will make allout blitzing much more dangerous for othe r teams Look for a return to those plusyard offensive averages in Its a Great Time to

with recruiting and other football news The number is It costs a minute You must be to call Mihm Turns Pro Barnes Cupboard Far from Bare AllAmerica center Chris Mihm announced Friday he is passing up his senior season at Texas to follow his lifelong dream of playing in the NBA It was a tough choice because I love the program at UT but I believe Im doing what makes the most sense Mihm said Mihm who led the Longhorns in scoring rebounding and blocked shots last season is projected as a top five pick in the NBA draft next month If Mihm had returned for his senior season the Longhorns probably would have been a preseason top team but coach Rick Barnes cupboard if far from bare and they should be a top team without him Among the six returning lettermen are junior forward Chris Owens a pow er in the paint and senior guard Darren Kelly a sharpshooter and strong defender Other lettermen include sophomore forward William Wyatt sophomore guardfo rwa rd Chris Ogden sophomore guard Roosevelt Brown and senior guard Chris McColpin But Barnes ace in the hole is transfer guard Maurice Evans a junior dynamo who practiced with the team last season after averaging points a game as a sophomore at Wichita State Evans has been very impressive in practice and he like Mihm has bigtime NBA potential Barnes offense is not as wide open as Wichita States but look for Evans to average or points a game and be one of the teams b ig guns offensively and defensively next season Barnes also has six recruits coming in including heralded JC point guard Freddie Williams plus four national top recruits in forward Brian Boddicker of Duncanville forward James Thomas of Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham Virginia swingman Brandon Mouton of Lafayette La and pound center Jason Klotz of Houston Klein Forest Guard Lawrence Williams announced plans to transfer two weeks ago and Barne s filled the scholarship by signing Royal Ivey a pound guard from Blair Academy a prep school in Blairstown N J Joe Montegna Iveys coach at Blair said the Longhorns picked up a real ge m He averaged points rebounds and assists for us Montegna said Hes a fine offensive player who is a true combo guard but hes much

To Date Monday June AM Subject True Orange June Part Jerry Scarbroughs True Orange The newsletter and faxemail service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful Volume No June Two of States Top Offensive Line Prospects Commit to Longhorns at Summer Camp Coach Mack Brown has revolutionized recruiting in Texas making June just a s big as January and he got the ball rolling again last week with pledges from the states best offensive lineman Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and another top oline prospect in Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls Scott is on all the national top lists and turned down offers from other schools such as Florida State Michigan and Tennessee to pick the Longhorns Scotts father Ray a former tight end with the New York Jets said Jonathan was very impressed with coach Brown and all the coaches and he told me he felt like the players were just one big family Scott also said his son wants to get a degree from Texas because he wants to live in Texas after he graduates Scott committed last Wednesday at the conclusion of UTs first full day summer camp It was the third straight summer he came to a Texas camp I just like everything about Texas Scott said adding that the coaches told him they want to work him at the key left tackle spot Allen who already had scholarship offers from Arkansas Duke Tulsa and South Carolina also committed at the camp Wednesday but didnt make it public until Thursday He has been a starter since his sophomore year Allen said he came to the camp hoping to get a scholarship offer and was eager to accept it when it was offered I knew this was where I wanted to go if the opportunity presented itself he said I like all the coaches and players at Texas and the facilities are great I feel like I can get a great education at Texas and just feel reall y comfortable with my decision to commit early Allen had taken unofficial visits to Texas Texas AM Notre Dame LSU and Baylor prior to coming to the Texas camp and he said Texas has great facilities its one of the top academic schools and it has an outstanding football program with great coaches and kids I just felt like it fit in better here than anywhere else Both Scott and Allen are honor students who already are full qualifiers Another UT camp is underway right now and there is good chance the Longhorns will get some more early commitments within the next several days Shane Simms of Tomball another of the states top offensive line prospects is attending this weeks camp and he wants to come to Texas so he is likely to commit if he gets an offer The Longhorns have zeroed in on two nationally recruited quarterbacks Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel a nd offered scholarships to each of them when they attended UT camps last week Both are and both are strongarmed passers with good mobility Rawls weighs about pounds and Nordgren weighs The Longhorns will sign at least one quarterback and it is hard to get two top ones in the same class so they probably are ready to take a commit fro m either Nordgren or Rawls and call it quits on quarterback recruiting this year Nordgren who had been looking primarily at Stanford and other outofstate schools said he is still wide open but he said Texas and Texas AM have moved to the top of his list right now Asked if there is a leader he said Im still pretty open but I like the two big Texas schools They both have outstanding coaching staffs He said the Longhorn coaches told me I was the No quarterback for them in the state I had an hour meeting with the coaches when I got there and the n I had another meeting with coach Brown after the camp was over The Longhorns also appear to be homing in on an instate running back and he is Anthony Johnson a pounder with speed from Jefferson Johnson told me he was coming to Austin last Saturday to talk to the UT coaches He said they had invited him to come for an unofficial visit On tape the thing that is most impressive about him is his speed at the point of attack He gets through a hole as quickly as anyone I have seen this year He has a great combination of speed and power and he should be a pounder after a year on a good college weight program The Longhorns probably will sign about recruits and or of them will be linemen if the coaches can get the ones they want Texas loaded up on speedy skill players in the last class but this class will be a true class of beef with six or seven offensive linemn and four o r five defensive linemen if things break right If linemen do get or of the scholarships look for the Horns to take one quarterback one or two running backs one tight end one or two wide receivers one or two linebackers and two or three defensive backs Weve already looked at the quarterback situation and the instate running back picture There are several outofstate bluechip running backs who ar e interested in Texas but they are long shots One of the running backs might be a fullback if the Horns can sign a great one like pound James Buchanan of Sarasota Fla He says he might visit Texas but FSU is the leader right now so he is a long shot for the Longhorns The tight end Texas is after is James Moses of Galena Park North Shore He is the best one in Texas and one of the best in the nation He told me he might come to a Texas camp and he said he likes the Longhorn s and the way they use their tight end The Longhorns are recruiting at least six wide receivers to try to fill two spots They are Armon Dorrough of Lancaster Brandon Jones of LibertyEylau Bennie Brazell of Houston Westbury Thomson Omboga of Grand Prairie Keith Mills of Garland and Lynzell Jackson of Union HS in Tempe Arizona All of them are speedsters and all of them have some interest in Texas The Longhorns loaded up on wide receivers last year but they have two senior wide receivers and would like to sign two recruits to replace them Derrick Johnson of Waco is the linebacker of choice for Texas and everyone else He is a great prospect with size and speed He came to the Texas minicamp last week and he says the Longhorns are slightly ahead of Florid a State and Texas AM Jonathon Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is another linebacker who is rising on the charts He is supposed to come to one of the Texas camps and he likes Texas and Penn State If the Longhorns can get Johnson and Jackson they will have hit it big at linebacker In the defensive backfield safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple is the main man Hes weighs and he ran a at the Austin Nike camp He likes Texas but Nebraska and Florida State are in the hunt too along with Texas AM Texas wants to sign two cornerbacks and there are some very good ones who are interested including Moses Harris of Dallas Carter Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes Dee Durham of Mansfield and Roger Ross of Denver Jefferson That brings us back to the lines There are more really topnotch offensive linemen in Texas than I have seen since in the years I have been doing this and luckily for the Longhorns that is their area of greatest need Texas has had depth problems in the offensive linemen ever since Brown and his staff arrived This is the year they should be able to sign as many top prospects as they need With Scott and Allen already committed there are four or five spots still open One of those will be filled by Alfio Randall if he graduates from Blinn JC and becomes academically eligible He signed with Texas out of Houston Yates but failed to qualify and went to Blinn He is on track to graduate in December and he says he will enroll in Texas in January Another possibility is Greg Barnum a former Killeen Ellison star who was being boomed for AllAmerica honors as a sophomore center at Tennessee before he abruptly quit the team last month citing homesickness But Phil Fulmer the Tennessee coach wont grant Barnum a release to atten d a Division I school That means he will have to pay his own way during the year he is sitting out at his new school if he picks another Division I school If he picks Stephen F Austin where his former coach at Killeen Ellison no w coaches he can go on scholarship immediately I talked to Barnum Sunday night and he said he was going to drive to Austin Monday to just look around at UT I know the coaches cant talk to me because he doesnt have a release but I just want to come over there and look around He said he has already visited Stephen F Austin and probably will make up his mind later this month about the course he will take Id like to go a big state school but Id also like to have a scholarship right away Barnum said I cant get a release from Tennessee so Ill have to decide what I want to do He said he will try to get some student loans and grants if he enrolls at U T as a nonscholarship student for the first year Under NCAA rules he will have to sit out a transfer year at his new school then will have three years of eligibility remaining Other offensive line prospects Texas is recruiting include Simms Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Roman Reeves of Livingston who all came to UT camps this summer plus Jami Hightower of Jacksonville Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill and William Winston of Houston Madison Hightower Wilkerson and Robinson join Scott on many of the national top lists Texas has a good shot at all of the offensive linemen I mentioned except Wilkerson and the Horns are on his radar screen now after being absent throughout the year The supply of offensive linemen is so plentiful that I think the UT coaches can sign five six or seven very good ones depending on how many they thin k they need The picture isnt as rosy on the defensive side of the ball DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison is a great prospect and DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is very good Harris is strongly considering Texas but Derricks has no interest in the Longhorns at this point They are the only surefire top tackles I have found in the state at this point There are some big ends who might grow into tackles For example Simeon Jones of Houston Jones is and but he has just turned too Hes a year younger than most of the guys being recruited so he might get a lot bigger There also are some outofstate tackles who have a little interest in Texas including Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of New Orleans DeLaSalle Some other tackles who could emerge as seniors include Sharod McGowan of Waco and Jeremy Calahan of Pflugerville They both looked great at times as juniors and could become top prospects with more consistent performances as seniors The picture is brighter at end Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson Jones McKenzie Tilmon of Irving MacArthur Jamie Jackson of Andrews and Colin Allred of Dallas Hillcrest are very good instate prospects and the Horns are in on two outofstate DEs who were born in Texas Eric Hall of Clarksville Tenn and Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Cal Its a Great Time to Subscribe

week It is believed to be a sprain Further tests will be conducted this week If it is a sprain he should be able to recover in time for the start of football practice in early July I f the injury turns out to be more severe it could cause him to miss some of the preseason practices The offseason conditioning workouts are going great and some of the offensive linemen appear to be dropping some pounds Junior Mike Williams and senior Cory Quye the two veterans who will battle for the right tackle slot both look more fit than I have ever seen them Williams still needs to drop a few more pounds so he can have the quickness to pick up speedy outside pass rushers but he is making progress Quye looks like he is ready to start the season right now Most of the key incoming freshmen are in Austin for the summer QB Chance Mock arrived last weekend and he looks like he has been following strength and conditioning mentor Mad Dog Maddens recommendations He appears to be about or pounds He looks

Tech and earned some playing time in the NFL But that wont happen with Chance Mock He is a Michael Vicktype quarterback with a great arm quick feet and a sturdy body And even if he could play

Texas Loses to LSU in World Series Plays FSU Tonight The Texas baseball made a huge leap from fourth in the Big to no worse than a tie for seventh in the country and it could be even better than that by the time you read this newsletter The Longhorns won their way into the College Baseball Series in Omaha by winning a subregional then a super regional in the last two weeks No seed LSU which won four national titles in the s burst the No seed Longhorns bubble at least temporarily with a thumping Saturday night in the first round of the World Series That threw Texas into the losers bracket and the Horns were to play Florid a State a loser to Southern Cal Saturday in an elimination game at pm tonight Monday If the Longhorns lose their season is over If they win they will play th e loser of the winners bracket game between LSU and USC If they win that game then they would have to beat the unbeaten team twice to win their division and set up a championship game against the winner of the other fourteam bracket That is a tall order because it means the Longhorns would have to win win five straight games to capture their fifth national title But whatever happens tonight or later in the tournament coach Augie Garrido and his Longhorns are back in Omaha for the first time since and UT baseball is back on track They did it by snapping out of a lateseason slump that saw them get shut out three times in their last six regular season games then go in the Big Tournament Because of their slow finish they were sent to a tough subregional in Tempe Arizona where the host team powerful Arizona State was a big favorite to advance The Longhorns opened by beating Creighton but then they fell to ASU to drop into the losers bracket It was a waste of an outstanding pitching performance by Beau Hale who held the powerful Sun Devils at bay for most of the day The Horns had to come back and play again that same day May and freshman Ray Clark saved the season by pitching a threehitter in an romp past Miami of Ohio It was an amazing performance by a true freshman and it also was a breakout game for the Longhorn hitters who had snoozed through most of May That meant Texas had to beat ASU on the Sun Devils home field twice on May after playing two games on May to advance But Clarks complete game gave Texas a chance because it kept the Horns fro m depleting their pitching staff before even getting to the final day Phil Seibel who missed almost the entire season with a sore arm allowed just five hits and one earned run in innings and Ben Emond drove in two runs and scored two more to power Texas to a win in the first game Freshman Ryan Hubele hit a threerun homer and Beau Hale put down a threat in the ninth to give the Horns the championship game by a score Hubele was the tourney MVP after hitting and batting in six runs Second baseman Tommy Nicholson shortstop Todd West outfielder Matt Rosenberg and pitchers Hale and Seibel made the AllTournament team The championship in Tempe earned the Horns a host spot in a super regional against Penn State Texas won the opener behind the pitching of D J Jones then mauled the Lions behind Hales threehit strikeout performance By the time most of you read this the Longhorns season might be over so lets look to the future Most of the key pitchers on this team will be gone next year but a few of them will return and Garrido and his staff have signed some great arms to replace the guys who are leaving They also have signed some big sticks that should enable the Horns to start winning a few slugfests They have rounded up an outstanding man recruiting class that gives them an excellent chance of being able to reload instead of undertaking a complete rebuilding job next baseball season They had a man class that was really good but they added No last weekend and that really was the frosting on the cake because he is Ben King a slugging hardthrowing lefthander from Grapevine who is leaving Alabama and coming to Texas after an outstanding freshman season After getting the Longhorns into the College Baseball World Series this year nothing would be sweeter than doing it again next year and this group of recruits just might help them accomplish that feat Of the recruits only two great prospects seem likely to sign They are catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo High School in suburban San Diego an d first baseman Jason Stokes of Coppell Heard hit last season with homers but he is more famous for his defensive prowess The pro scouts think he is the best overall catching prospect in several years and that prompted the Texas Rangers to draft him in the first round Stokes is an incredible power hitter who batted and blasted home runs last season and was chosen by the Florida Marlins with the first pick in the drafts second round Both are expected to receive offers that will be very difficult to pass up Both families say negotiations with their pro teams are in the early stages They also say contrary to published reports that no firm offers have been made Lets take a quick look at the other UT recruits Most of them signed in the early period but this is an uptodate look at how they performed in the justcompleted baseball season Late Transfer Bonus Baby Ben King will be eligible next season as a sophomore because you dont have to sit out a year in baseball when you transfer He was one of the states top recruits last year and picked Alabama over Texas He was an honorable mention freshman AllAmerica at Alabama after hitting home run s and batting as a designated hitter But King was a dominating pitcher in high school and he wants to pitch too He only pitched four innings at Alabama and that in a nutshell is why he will be a Longhorn next season As a lefty with good control and a mileanhour fastball hell get to pitch more than that at Texas in The Horns can use that powerful bat too With the low scholarship limits in baseball total chopped into various sizes pitcherhitter combos give double value Pitchers Albert Montes is a righthanded pitcher from El Paso who was the ace of the National JC World Series champs from Grayson JC in Denison He went and Grayson coach Tim Tadlock said Albert Montes should have been the MVP of the national tournament He won the opening game for us then came back to win two other games He has a fastball in the s to go along with a good curve but the thing that makes him so good is that he changes his arm angles a lot and gives the batters a lot of different looks Hes a real bulldog on the mound Montes pitched the championship game on two days rest and gave up three hits and one run while striking out He was the national tourneys Most Valuable Pitcher in and and won the title game bot h times Justin Simmons is a lefty with great

fastball in the low s struck out in innings and had an ERA But he hurt his shoulder late in the season and had arthroscopic surgery He did not pitch his senio r year but hit with six home runs His father Harvey told me the doctors think his shoulder is fine now and he should be able to resume pitching at Texas with no ill effects from the surgery If he does recover completely a lefthander with good control and a live mph fastball is a thing of beauty when he plays for you and a terror to behold when he plays for the other team Gerrit Simpson is a righthanded pitcherfirst baseman from Claremore Okla who played the last two years at Connors JC in Oklahoma He was as a pitcher last season who averaged more than strikeouts pe r inning and allowed only two walks per game His fast ball is consistent around and has been clocked as high as He also has a good curve ball He hit too Derek Denman is a righthander from Euless Trinity who was the closer on Graysons JC title team He had
