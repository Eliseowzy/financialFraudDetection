undercollectionsinvestigations attached is a draft strategy to develop a concensus position with as many parties as possible going into the next legislative session which begins in January There are rumors that the Governor may call for a special session which would expedite the treatment of energy issues Please provide any commentsconcerns on this approach asap Because of the undercollections the utilities that accumulated by virtue of the rate cap for SCE and PGE and the high summer prices there is a strong move by the utilities to end the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible However ending the rate freeze early has serious implications for EESs book of business in addition to the potential to expose consumers to rate shock a la San Diego if the rate cap is removed prior to next summer In conversations with various organizations WPTF ARM IEP TURN and internally Roger Yang there may be fertile ground for negotiating a settlement that could be supported by the aforementioned organizations provide utility some hope of recovery of their undercollected costs continue stabilized rates for small consumers through forward contracting providing opportunities for ENA and defining the utilities role as serving only residential and small commercial customers creating marketing opportunities for larger customers and marketers The components of a settlement would need to address Rate Freeze DurationValue of Hydro Undercollection Treatment Utility Procurement and PricingDefault Provider The proposal would be as follows Maintain existing rate freeze through transition period either or a This gives the utilities a reasonable opportunity to mitigate undercollection in TRA through valuation of hydro and generation revenues from the hydro and nuclear facilities It also gives the utility time to structure its portfolio for serving its default customersforward contract b Maintains rate stability for consumers through tight summer supply periods c Continues CPUC deliberative valuation of remaining generation assets including hydro CPUC recently ordered that supplemental testimony could be filed on December to adjust values to reflect recent market events We think that the rate freeze cannot end without a valuation of the assets which is required by December This could be a very significant mitigation piece Provide an Equitable Outcome of the Undercollected Balance a While the UDCs believe they can retroactively effect an end to the rate freeze and receive full recovery of any uncollected power purchase costs TURN has filed saying that these power purchase costs should be treated as a transition cost and the utilities should be given the opportunity to recover those costs during the transition period with the same risk exposure they have always had Anything still in the account as of is shareholder risk b There may be a nice middle ground here I think there are some legal issues with TURNs proposal about treating current unrecovered electricity costs as stranded costs However there is merit to say lets get to the end of the transition period and net the overcollections in the transition cost balancing account TCBA against the undercollected transition revenue account TRA Both SCE and PGE have been recording revenues from hydo nukes PPAs and QFs These revenues in addition to the remaining asset valuations will provide a substantial offset to the undercollected revenue balance c In addition there may be additional merit to some sharing of any remaining undercollected balance after netting the two accounts between ratepayers and shareholders An argument can be made that the utilities were overexposed to the market volatility due to the lack of forward contracting Others may say that the utilities should be responsible for the runup in gas prices and ERCs and that ratepayers be responsible for the balance Another way may be to look at allowing recovery of abovecost prices for period from June Oct This presumes that the Commission will not try to pursue disgorging profits from marketersgenerators This amount could be amortized over a several year period years beginning While the sharing may not be critical to Enron it will be a big negotiating point between ratepayer advocates and the utilities Clearer definition of utilities procurement role a Define utilitys roles as procurer for residential and small commercial customers at a levelized price for fixed period of time years This provides clarity to the utility on for whom they should contract It will also alleviate claims about future stranded costs whenif default role changes b Allow procurement flexibility on meeting that responsibility Reasonableness will be an issue Need to determine if we want to propose anything or nothing c Provide only POLR service to industrial customers flow through of a spot market price plus retail adders d At the end of the default transition period begin the process of alternative default providers Regulatory

a call with Nancy Vogel energy reporter from the LA Times today and other ARM members Peter Bray The New Power Company and Rick Counihan Green Mountain The conversation was mostly to provide background on retail issues I emphasized that Peter and Rick were the spokespeople for the coalition and I was there for background purposes only She was very receptive and seemed to grasp the importance of developing a retail market We discussed how AB was mostly geared toward developing a competitive wholesale market and provided very little guidance about retail market structure We discussed that during the rate freeze there was no impetus for consumers to shop so long as they were insulated from market prices We also stated that the transition period was used more for ensuring stranded cost recovery and not for developing a retail market structure We said that we have been raising the lack of retail market structure in various proceedings at the CPUC Now that deregulation is center stage in the administration and likely the legislature we feel it is important to include retail competition as a solution to the problems in the market today There was discussion about the utilities being required to purchase on a spot basis through the PX and passing those costs directly to consumers With the spikes over the summer consumers in San Diego revolted against such substantial increases without notice Because the retail market was essentially undeveloped consumers didnt know they had somewhere else to go for relief Nancy asked why the retail market has not developed Rick responded that some of the authors of the legislation either believed that competition at the wholesale level would provide adequate benefits to consumers and therefore retail competition was not valuable or that the rate freeze insulation from price increases was an adequate quid pro quo to utility recovery of stranded costs Regulators have moved very slowly on cost separation issues allowing the utilities to continue to recover the costs of their retail services through distribution rates from all customers make their prices appear to be cheaper Lastly neither the legislature nor the Commission determined what the utilities role in the new restructured environment would be are they a pipeswires company are they facilitators for direct access are they competitors We explained that we believe there is a strong reason to define the utilities obligation to serve residential and small commercial customers now Large customers can take care of themselves Why is this important As the utilities enter into contracts they need clarity on for whom they have an obligation to purchase This minimizes any potential for future stranded cost claims any claims that the utilities could make absent such direction up front Secondly it reduces the utilities ability to charge an exit fee or other financial claim on departing customers who decide to go direct access The next piece of the puzzle would be to define the default service for residential and small commercial customers The utility would provide a fixedrate product to small residential and commercial customers for a transitional period of time Based upon the San Diego experience it is politically imperative that smaller customers have rate certainty This also provides a target against which other service providers can compete The utilitys price is a fixed price with no trueup The utility would have purchasing flexibility to meet the target price The price could be set by the CPUC A certain portion of the utilitys purchases will still be met through spot market purchaes Customer migration res and small commercial should not be an issue The last piece of the puzzle would be to encourage competition for the default provider role ala PECO where of the residential customers went through an auction process This issues is important to Shell and The New Power Company She seemed very interested in the issue recognized that no one else was talking about it and she may want to follow up with individuals later Getting customer affadavits would be another indicator of value for

To cc Subject Fwd PGE Advice Letter E You may recall that PGE files an advice letter on to revise all its tariffs because the rate freeze had purportedly ended The attached letter from Paul Clanon shoots down that theory He writes that AL E is not compliant because at a minimum The rate freeze for PGE is not over Pursuant to OP of D the end of the rate freeze for PGE and Southern California Edison shall not occur before the generation assets of each utility have been market valued except as the law or the Commission determines otherwise The Commission has not ordered that the rate freeze can end based on the estimated market value of PGEs generation assets As PGE acknowledges in AL E it is required by OP in D to file an advice letter three months prior to the earliest forecasted date and an advice letter five days after the rate freeze ends PGE cannot by unilateral action collapse these two filings into one without review and an order of the Commission authorizing such a modification NOTE This issimilar towhat we said in our RAP response to Edisons motion to sever the PX Credit issue from the RAP proceeding As PGE acknowledges the proposed Distribution Revenue Adjustment Mechanism DRAM and the new rate component associated with the DRAM were not authorized by D which contemplated that PGE would be operating under a Performance Based Ratemaking mechanism after the rate freeze ended or by subsequent decisions The proposed Unrecovered Cost of Service Account UCSA and the new rate component associated with the UCSA were not authorized by D and are not in compliance with any Commission decision To the extent that PGE proposes to transfer TRA undercollections incurred prior to the end of the rate freeze to the UCSA ALE violates D OP and D The treatment of retained generation revenues proposed in this AL was not authorized by D or by subsequent decisions Whoopee Dan Received from dymwsmmailwatchcom by ArterHaddencom Tue Dec Received from

undercollectionsinvestigations attached is a draft strategy to develop a concensus position with as many parties as possible going into the next legislative session which begins in January There are rumors that the Governor may call for a special session which would expedite the treatment of energy issues Please provide any commentsconcerns on this approach asap Because of the undercollections the utilities that accumulated by virtue of the rate cap for SCE and PGE and the high summer prices there is a strong move by the utilities to end the rate freeze as expeditiously as possible However ending the rate freeze early has serious implications for EESs book of business in addition to the potential to expose consumers to rate shock a la San Diego if the rate cap is removed prior to next summer In conversations with various organizations WPTF ARM IEP TURN and internally Roger Yang there may be fertile ground for negotiating a settlement that could be supported by the aforementioned organizations provide utility some hope of recovery of their undercollected costs continue stabilized rates for small consumers through forward contracting providing opportunities for ENA and defining the utilities role as serving only residential and small commercial customers creating marketing opportunities for larger customers and marketers The components of a settlement would need to address Rate Freeze DurationValue of Hydro Undercollection Treatment Utility Procurement and PricingDefault Provider The proposal would be as follows Maintain existing rate freeze through transition period either or a This gives the utilities a reasonable opportunity to mitigate undercollection in TRA through valuation of hydro and generation revenues from the hydro and nuclear facilities It also gives the utility time to structure its portfolio for serving its default customersforward contract b Maintains rate stability for consumers through tight summer supply periods c Continues CPUC deliberative valuation of remaining generation assets including hydro CPUC recently ordered that supplemental testimony could be filed on December to adjust values to reflect recent market events We think that the rate freeze cannot end without a valuation of the assets which is required by December This could be a very significant mitigation piece Provide an Equitable Outcome of the Undercollected Balance a While the UDCs believe they can retroactively effect an end to the rate freeze and receive full recovery of any uncollected power purchase costs TURN has filed saying that these power purchase costs should be treated as a transition cost and the utilities should be given the opportunity to recover those costs during the transition period with the same risk exposure they have always had Anything still in the account as of is shareholder risk b There may be a nice middle ground here I think there are some legal issues with TURNs proposal about treating current unrecovered electricity costs as stranded costs However there is merit to say lets get to the end of the transition period and net the overcollections in the transition cost balancing account TCBA against the undercollected transition revenue account TRA Both SCE and PGE have been recording revenues from hydo nukes PPAs and QFs These revenues in addition to the remaining asset valuations will provide a substantial offset to the undercollected revenue balance c In addition there may be additional merit to some sharing of any remaining undercollected balance after netting the two accounts between ratepayers and shareholders An argument can be made that the utilities were overexposed to the market volatility due to the lack of forward contracting Others may say that the utilities should be responsible for the runup in gas prices and ERCs and that ratepayers be responsible for the balance Another way may be to look at allowing recovery of abovecost prices for period from June Oct This presumes that the Commission will not try to pursue disgorging profits from marketersgenerators This amount could be amortized over a several year period years beginning While the sharing may not be critical to Enron it will be a big negotiating point between ratepayer advocates and the utilities Clearer definition of utilities procurement role a Define utilitys roles as procurer for residential and small commercial customers at a levelized price for fixed period of time years This provides clarity to the utility on for whom they should contract It will also alleviate claims about future stranded costs

call with Nancy Vogel energy reporter from the LA Times today and other ARM members Peter Bray The New Power Company and Rick Counihan Green Mountain The conversation was mostly to provide background on retail issues I emphasized that Peter and Rick were the spokespeople for the coalition and I was there for background purposes only She was very receptive and seemed to grasp the importance of developing a retail market We discussed how AB was mostly geared toward developing a competitive wholesale market and provided very little guidance about retail market structure We discussed that during the rate freeze there was no impetus for consumers to shop so long as they were insulated from market prices We also stated that the transition period was used more for ensuring stranded cost recovery and not for developing a retail market structure We said that we have been raising the lack of retail market structure in various proceedings at the CPUC Now that deregulation is center stage in the administration and likely the legislature we feel it is important to include retail competition as a solution to the problems in the market today There was discussion about the utilities being required to purchase on a spot basis through the PX and passing those costs directly to consumers With the spikes over the summer consumers in San Diego revolted against such substantial increases without notice Because the retail market was essentially undeveloped consumers didnt know they had somewhere else to go for relief Nancy asked why the retail market has not developed Rick responded that some of the authors of the legislation either believed that competition at the wholesale level would provide adequate benefits to consumers and therefore retail competition was not valuable or that the rate freeze insulation from price increases was an adequate quid pro quo to utility recovery of stranded costs Regulators have moved very slowly on cost separation issues allowing the utilities to continue to recover the costs of their retail services through distribution rates from all customers make their prices appear to be cheaper Lastly neither the legislature nor the Commission determined what the utilities role in the new restructured environment would be are they a pipeswires company are they facilitators for direct access are they competitors We explained that we believe there is a strong reason to define the utilities obligation to serve residential and small commercial customers now Large customers can take care of themselves Why is this important As the utilities enter into contracts they need clarity on for whom they have an obligation to purchase This minimizes any potential for future stranded cost claims any claims that the utilities could make absent such direction up front Secondly it reduces the utilities ability to charge an exit fee or other financial claim on departing customers who decide to go direct access The next piece of the puzzle would be to define the default service for residential and small commercial customers The utility would provide a fixedrate product to small residential and commercial customers for a transitional period of time Based upon the San Diego experience it is politically imperative that smaller customers have rate certainty This also provides a target against which other service providers can compete The utilitys price is a fixed price with no trueup The utility would have purchasing flexibility to meet the target price The price could be set by the CPUC A certain portion of the utilitys purchases will still be met through spot market purchaes Customer migration res and small commercial should not be an issue The last piece of the puzzle would be to encourage competition for the default provider role ala PECO where of the residential customers went through an auction process This issues is important to Shell and The New Power Company She seemed very interested in the issue recognized that no one else was talking about it and she may want to follow up with individuals later Getting customer affadavits would be another indicator of value for developing a retail

cc Subject Fwd PGE Advice Letter E You may recall that PGE files an advice letter on to revise all its tariffs because the rate freeze had purportedly ended The attached letter from Paul Clanon shoots down that theory He writes that AL E is not compliant because at a minimum The rate freeze for PGE is not over Pursuant to OP of D the end of the rate freeze for PGE and Southern California Edison shall not occur before the generation assets of each utility have been market valued except as the law or the Commission determines otherwise The Commission has not ordered that the rate freeze can end based on the estimated market value of PGEs generation assets As PGE acknowledges in AL E it is required by OP in D to file an advice letter three months prior to the earliest forecasted date and an advice letter five days after the rate freeze ends PGE cannot by unilateral action collapse these two filings into one without review and an order of the Commission authorizing such a modification NOTE This issimilar towhat we said in our RAP response to Edisons motion to sever the PX Credit issue from the RAP proceeding As PGE acknowledges the proposed Distribution Revenue Adjustment Mechanism DRAM and the new rate component associated with the DRAM were not authorized by D which contemplated that PGE would be operating under a Performance Based Ratemaking mechanism after the rate freeze ended or by subsequent decisions The proposed Unrecovered Cost of Service Account UCSA and the new rate component associated with the UCSA were not authorized by D and are not in compliance with any Commission decision To the extent that PGE proposes to transfer TRA undercollections incurred prior to the end of the rate freeze to the UCSA ALE violates D OP and D The treatment of retained generation revenues proposed in this AL was not authorized by D or by subsequent decisions Whoopee Dan Received from dymwsmmailwatchcom by ArterHaddencom Tue Dec Received from dymwmailwatchcom
