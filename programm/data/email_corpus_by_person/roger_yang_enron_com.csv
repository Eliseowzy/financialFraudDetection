<16259287.1075842964558.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-09-07 09:35:00,Re Gov Davis Press Release Cc the implementation plan for the Res and Small Commercial makes good sense This is good intelligence for preparing our curves and pricing models however these customers are not our commercial focus and only tend to show up as a few sites in a portfolio of sites SDGEs plan was our preferred plan to the extent that the Legislature or Commission had implemented a mandatory rate cap for all size customers With respect to the larger optin customers I expect that this is only available to Standard Offer customers SDGE should prevent cost shifting to other customers who do not benefit from the cap ie SO customers who do n ot optin and DA customers who do not have the option Even customers who optin will vary by differing degrees in terms of the size of the customer and timeframe It seems to me the only equitable implementation plan for the optin customers is a customerspecific balancing account similar to that which is implemented for the balanced payment plan otherwise too much gaming will ensue which would result in the need for administratively burdensome tracking To the extent that SDGE makes all customers includi ng DA customers pay for the undercollections we can switch our customers to Standard Offer without any negative ramifications Note It would be difficult to exercise such a regulatory switching option if only those customers who benefit incur a surcharge into the future because our customers would balk at us exercising the option during our contract term a nd imposing a future liability on our customer beyond the contract term In fact it might be better if all customers were expected to pay for the undercollections so that we can exercise the regulatory switching option What do others think I think we can work with either implementation method If it is a customerspecific balancing account we will make customers know that the lower rates is the equivalent to a loan they will need to eventually pay off If it is all customers who are expected to pay we will exercise the regulatory switching option We need to be careful no t to share too much of this strategy and insights with the utility because they will counter by imposing new rules and charges for switching customers between DA and SO I dont believe that SDGEs shareholders should be held accountable for a percentage of the shortfalls This would provide a subsidy to SO service I believe it is more important that customers realize that the utilitys SO service is not the right solution versus trying to drive the utility away from SO service Either outcome works for us The last issue I will address is the timing of recovery of the undercollections Will recovery begin during the period of the cap such th at the cap will effectively be implemented as a freeze Or will the recovery begin after the cap expires resulting in otherwise higher future rates Defering cost recovery will always work to our advantage from a book perspective The key for me is to know asap the details so that we can properly model our curves for pricing new deals and reflect the changes in our book However since these questions largely pertain to the smaller customers in SDGEs service territory I do not anticipate a large impact on our book and our marketing efforts In fact I think the burdens of the modeling changes would outweigh much of the benefits of this legislation fo r us Thanks for the intelligence Roger Mona L Petrochko PM To Douglas ES James M ES Martin ES Greg Cordell Chris ES Edward ES Jennifer ES Dennis E S Roger Yang Harry ES Gary ES cc West GA James D ES Subject Gov Davis Press Release Governor has NOT signed AB million from the general fund He HA S signed AB SDGE rate cap bill and AB expedited siting for nonpermanent peaking I had a conversation today with Wayne Sakarias from SDGE about implementation It appears based on the press release that the Commissi on will act tomorrow to adopt an order that will begin the implementation process although the order is not available for review yet I asked Wayne how they intended to implement the bill He believes that th e optin provision for large CI customers and any associated undercollectio ns associated with the customers that optin would be handled separately from the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercia l customers I asked how they would collect any shortfalls It didnt soun d like they had a plan yet I suggested balancing account treatment for the customers that benefit from the optin with any shortfalls recovered as quickly as possible but no later than year Relative to ResSmall Commercial He said that SDGE will propose in response to ARM comments that the cap for res and small commercial customers would not disadvantage DA customers In other words they are concerned about the appearances that SDGEs rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and woul d make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism that in effect would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w SDGE For example If prevailing market prices were centskWh SDGEs res a nd small commercial customers would only be charged upto cents and DA customers would receive a centkWh credit against their TD charges so th at in effect there is no economic advantage to staying w SDGE However wh en it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections DA and bundled custome rs would again be treated comparably Their BIG concern is that the Commission will hang them out to dry on reasonableness We agreed to keep the dialogue open Things will likely happen quickly I f folks have any recommendations or see problems with the

Sandra ES cc Subject Gov Davis Press Release OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR L FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting process for new power plants One of the major achievements of this years legislative session is our aggressive response to Californias energy challenge Governor Davis said My Administration did not create this problem but we are percent committed to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for residential customers in San Diego will be reduced to Small businesses all school s and acutecare hospitals are included will pay an average monthly bill of Medium businesses consuming up to kilowatthours a month wou ld also have a price cap of cents per kilowatthour For large businesses AB would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDGE over a longer period of time AB by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny DSan Diego and Assemblyman Jim Battin RLa Quinta will help California overcome the inadequate supply of energy one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices by expediting the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for upgrades of old facilities Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those who would build more power generators in California Governor Davis said This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing demand It will also establish new programs to reduce demand Over the last three months Governor Gray Davis leadership has been demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta te facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen cy and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa n Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on t he price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it take s new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies Please go to briefingexecorderindexshtm to view copi es of Governor Davis Executive Orders On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by near ly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi ng him to expedite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The president also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers Todays bill signing is the culmination of that agreement GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

<14773038.1075842976796.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-09-21 08:25:00,PGE Strategy to End the Rate Freeze Early and Potential Book Impact Cc an email that I sent to my management earlier this week A also have a couple of questions and observations First do we have anything in writing from PGE when they refused to comply with our request to revise their Rolloff Matrix Also I spoke with Jeff who informed me of the various variables that the market has to work with to negotiate with PGE I agree with the following variables extend the rate freeze beyond but no later than the end of a to billion hydro valuation on January to cover TRA and TCBA undercollections at that point in time with future payments based on a revenue requirement calculation and a fixed rate of return These fixed payments will be offset by the wholesale market revenues for the hydro output Ratepayers will have to make up the difference in the future through a balancing account and fixed surcharge or surcredit in financial derivative terms this is is the equivalent of a negative index fixed revenue requirement market revenues presumed to be the PX This essentially NPVs the cashflows to payoff shortfalls today at the risk of creating shortfalls in the future to the extent that the value is too high increase the level of the frozen rate at some modest amount Keep in mind a per mWh increase in PGEs rates beginning January translates to a million hit to the book for through so we would need an offsetting benefit We could probably offset this hit if the rate freeze was extended through March allow PGE to hedge procurement costs for the extended frozen time period it is critical that the rate freeze does not end before July for all customers including large and small and DA and SO Preferably the rate freeze would end no earlier than December or They can also extend the rate freeze for a longer period of time for small customers or change the freeze to an SDGE type of mechanism beyond December The following is PGEs situtation As you can see that they will be trying to cut their losses even though they have still not fully collected all outstanding undercollections Undercollections are projected to grow through next year What PGE will be looking for is a way out or a swaption to switch customers from the fixed to index asap I dont think they will be so quick to do give up million at this point and will be interested in some type of settlement that would protect this amount There is still the political hot potato about rolling off early and selling out customers and the only way they could do this is with a quick valuation of hydro Maybe they would be willing to take some loss even in a settlement to avoid upsetting politicians and customers If the process is delayed PGEs exposure will probably be over billion by the end of the year and possible billion by the end of So you see there would be a need for some combination of a slight increase in rates extension of the freeze to capture the backwardation in commodity price and a higher hydro valuation with ratepayers incurring the risk for the higher valuation in the future in exchange for a deal that insulates ratepayers from volatility and rate shock today It is key that the extended Rate Freeze equitably treats DA customers in the form of todays rate freeze with a PX credit that is not capped Roger Forwarded by Roger YangSFOEES on PM Roger Yang PM To Dennis ES Scott ES cc Marty ES Subject PGE Strategy to End the Rate Freeze Early and Potential Book Impact PGE filed Advice Letter EA on September requesting to revise its hydro value estimate of a billion previously filed in June to billion retroactively effective on June Although PGE does not state the intent to end the rate freeze effective July it is clear that PGE will claim that the billion interim valuation will render the rate freeze as having ended retroactively on July if the CPUC approves this advice letter Our estimates show that this is viable however PGE will be undercollected by million in its Transition Revenue Account It is unclear whether PGE is willing to forego this undercollection in order to avoid incurring higher undercollections from the runup in electric commodity prices under a rate freeze or if PGE has some other plan to recover this undercollection as a postfreeze rate adder Even though Decision Nos and adopt ratemaking methodologies to establish an interim valuation that triggered PGEs Advice Letter filings this decision states that the CPUC will address the impact of this accounting on the end of the rate freeze at the appropriate time and in the appropriate proceeding p Hence there is no conclusive decision that states that this interim valuation should be used to end the rate freeze In fact the utilities had argued the contrary it could not be used in this manner Since PGE has already sent out bills for August and should alreay wdy have sent out bills for September by the final resolution of this Advice Letter I believe the earliest implementation date for ending the rate freeze would be October In addition I would have to believe that allowing PGE to implement an end to the rate freeze effective July would violate codes on retroactive ratemaking since it would result in an immediate increase to PGEs customers The book impact to EESI for a termination date of October would be a million loss A delay to an October end date would result in an undercollection for PGE greater than billion PGE will try to recover this undercollection in future rates if the end date is October To the extent that such recover is delayed and recovered over an extended period of time the impact on the book could be minor due to the expiration of many of our contracts in AB Section a states These frozen rate levels for each customer class rate schedule contract or tariff option shall remain in effect until the earlier of March or the date on which the commissionauthorized costs for utility generationrelated assets and obligations have been fully recovered The electrical corporation shall be at risk for those costs not recovered during that time period I interpret this to mean that the utility does not have the option to artificially end the rate freeze earlier However PGE may be trying to end the rate freeze early through an interim valuation of hydro assets AB Section a states For those assets subject to valuation the valuations used for the calculation of the uneconomic portion of the net book value shall be determined not later than December and shall be based on appraisal sale or other divestiture The commisions determination of the costs eligible for recovery and of the valuation of those assets at the time the assets are exposed to market risk or retired in a proceeding under Section or otherwise shall be final and notwithstanding Section or any other provision of law may not be rescindeded altered or amended PGEs original position was an interim valuation could not end the rate freeze when PGE had thought it could overcollect CTCs before the runup in market prices Now PGE is trying to rewrite history after the fact by using an interim valuation that is higher than their original estimate Per Decision No PGE and SCE were ordered to file an advice letter three months prior to the earliest forecasted date that the rate feeze will end or Sepetmeber if the rate freeze does not end earlyThe Advice Letter implementing rate changes shall become effective within days of the end of the rate freeze subject to Energy Division determining the Advice Letter is in compliance Ordering Paragraph To the best of my knowledge PGE has yet to file an advice letter providing months notice of an end to the rate freeze This demonstrates that PGE is taking desperate actions In that same decision the CPUC ordered that PGE and SCE shall provide to interested parties estimates of the date the rate freeze will end and file advice letters to effectuate the end of the rate freeze as set forth herein Ordering Paragraph To date every estimate filed with the CPUC showed that the rate freeze would end no earlier than January In fact Enron has notified PGE on prior occasions of the possibility of a potential earlier end date and PGE dismissed our concerns about the misinformation perpetrated by PGEs filings This demonstrates a willful act on PGEs part to commit fraud if they were to end the rate freeze before This would not be the first time that PGE has manipulated the regulatory process In its General Rate Case PGE was communicating an expectation of to rate drops at the end of the freeze which were later revised to drops The effect was to paralyze customers from choosing an alternate supplier which turns out was not in the customers best interest Finally the decision states the end of the rate freeze shall not occur before the generation assets of each utility have been marketvalued except as the law or the Commission determine otherwise Ordering Paragraph This provision clearly demonstrates that despite all of PGEs acts it will be the final decision of either the Legislature or Commission as to whether they will allow PGE to end the rate freeze retroactively without any advance notice and causing an immediate increase in utility bills to half of the customers of investorowned utilities in California If the Legislature or Commission is willing to commit this type of political suicide then PGEs grip on these bodies is tighter than we could ever imagine As opposed to PGEs desperate plans that would negatively impact California customers we willl pursue a winwin strategy Amongst various strategies would be to extend the rate freeze up to December A freeze ending any period between July and December will have a positive impact on our book Estimates from a month ago showed a positive impact in the ballpark of million if the rate freeze were to end on December Of course our preference would be to end earlier than so as to avoid a potential negative impact on future sales however we believe this PGE would require at least this time frame in order to mitigate its undercollections that it would incur for the next few years PGE will benefit by the opportunity to maximize recovery especially given an opportunity to now hedge this risk and with the hedge funded by ratepayers ENA will have the opportunity to sell to PGE Customers get a reprieve and will have an additional four years to prepare for the new market structure knowing what they may expect from the scare from this summers With a better informed customer we may even be able to still sell in California The Governor Legislature and Regulators can defer the concerns to someone elses term in office At a minimum we should try to negotiate some joint proposal with PGE that would extend the rate freeze to December or March with guaranteed recovery of undercollections for PGE for some time period beyond those dates If adopted by CPUC PGE would get the PL protection they need and customers can benefit from the reprieve from higher rates I think the key is to preserve the current AB rate freeze mechanism versus a mechanism similar to that enacted by the Legislature for SDGE because that legislation does not adequately protect all customers and competitors equally The only solution will be a winwin solution The Wall Stree Journal speculates that PGE will be reluctant to be too aggressive in selling out customers and may be positioning itself to negotiate a winwin solution We need to make sure we are part of that winning solution if not influence that solution Moodys Investor Services Inc issued a negative outlook on PGE and PGEs stock price has dropped from to in the last week Government Affairs is on top of this issue Roger

per our contract with the customer This penalty is unacceptable if we are expected by the customer to pay the penalties The plan does provide for putting the customer in a Rotating Outage queue if the

<7200264.1075842996407.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-10-12 07:45:00,Re OII into the Operation of Interruptible Load Programs of SDGE S CE and PGE Cc that the decision was made to not comment due to customer relations concerns This is probably wise My take on our deals with interruptible customers is that we priced deals assuming that the customer would stay on an interruptible rate schedule and abide by the terms of that schedule and all tariff rules for that schedule through the expiration date of the schedule on March per PU Code Section These interruptible programs are programs administered by the local distribution company based on decisions to interrupt from the ISO As I understand the decisions to interrupt is based on system reliability issues thereby justifying recovery of the cost of the program from all customers whom benefit from system reliability The customers decision to contract with the LDC to be on an interruptible schedule and in some cases contract with an ESP under the assumption that the customer remains on the schedule is primarily an issue between the customer and the LDC If a customer elects to not abide by the terms of the rate schedule the customer should be responsible for the consequences Hopefully are contract language specifies that the customer must pay the penalties for defaulting on rules for interruptible service I dont know how tight are contract language is with respect to the expectation to stay on interruptible service through March and passing through penalties If one of customers elect to leave the interruptible schedule before March I presume this would be grounds for nullifying the contract or renegotiating the contract In addition to the system reliability reasons for curtailing it looks like the utilities ISO and CPUC are looking for curtailment programs as demandresponsiveness programs in order to mitigate purported supplyside market power and reduce prices to California Under the current crisis this is a good thing The question is who pays for these programs I have heard arguments that all loads should pay since all loads benefit from the externalities of lower prices from lower demands This is only true for those loads be supplied by the spot market On the other hand we have made the argument that only those customers that directly benefit should pay for the cost of the program In other words a program for SO customers should be funded by SO customers because the cost of programs sponsored by ESPs for DA customers are not recovered from SO customers I think that we need to divide this issue into a solution and longerterm solution Arguable the and perhaps solutions are to benefit all load including DA so long as the current rate freeze structure is maintained However in a postfreeze structure the policy should probably be that only those who directly benefit should pay Another longterm policy guideline should be based on participation In other words eligibility of participation should also determine whether DA customers should also pay for the program Direct Benefits Eligible to Participate Who pays LDC Administered Program to address System Reliability All Customers All Customers with the proper metering and telemetry All Customers LDC Administered Program to address economic conditions under current market conditions and current rate freeze structure All Customers so long as the rate freeze is maintained and prices are high SO customers with proper metering and telemetry If all Customers must pay then the program should accommodate participation by DA customers as well LDC in a default provider role administered program to address postfreeze economic conditions SO Customers SO Customers SO Customers ESP Administered Program to address postfreeze economic conditions DA Customer DA Customer DA Customer It is important to make the distinction in what capacity is the LDC administering interruptible programs as seen above Also it is important to understand the role of SCs and the ISO SCs are just the vehicle by which ESPs and wholesale marketers implement DA curtailment programs and participate in ISO and PX markets for energy and ancillary services The ISO like the utilities wears two hats The ISO implements directions to the LDCs to curtail based on a last resort need to curtail The ISO is also trying to develop market solutions involving SCs and the LDC in their role as a default provider in order to avoid having to issue general directions to utilities to curtail The utility similarly tries to first use interruptible rate schedules then as a last resort relies on rolling blackouts It may be important to determine what category do new LDC programs fit into in the shortrun and the longrun

S CE and PGE Sue Mona Jeff and Sandi Mike and I wanted to give you a preview of the Commissions latest actions in response to the crisis in the California electric market In short the Commission has instituted an Investigation in to operation of the interruptible load programs of the three UDCs and the effect of these programs on energy prices other demand responsiveness programs and the reliability of the electric system The item which has gotten the most press from the OII so far is the proposed temporary suspension of the tariff provisions of the three UDCs that allow customers to opt out of their interruptible program contracts during the day window commencing November st The Commission is using its authority under PUC Section which gives the Commission specific authority to amend interruptible contracts between the UDCs and qualified heavy industrials to propose such suspension Although parties are allowed to comment on the suspension by this Thursday the th the Commission does have the apparent authority to effect the change and it will most likely proceed with the suspension Apart from the enforced extension of the interruptible contracts however the OII potentially could have broader ramifications The intent of the OII is to examine all interruptible curtailable and demand responsiveness programs being currently offered andor proposed in California and to determine how these programs can best be structured andor reformulated to serve the Commissions goal of ensuring reliable and reasonably priced electric service within California especially for the summer of It is hard to tell exactly what the Commission has in mind However it is possible that such reformulation of curtailabledemand responsiveness programs could interfere with Enrons and other ESPs ability to make interruptible demand responsive deals with customers Moreover the OII is not merely looking at larger customers It states as one of the purposes of the rulemaking the identification of if and how smaller customers can participate in curtailable programs Specifically the OII states that we need to examine the ability of smaller customers to participate the development of rate design and incentive polices of such participation a costbenefit analysis of such programs and the marketing of any such programs Such investigation and potential implementation of demand responsiveness programs for smaller customers could impact and interfere with ARMs attempts to structure a competitive default provider program We would like the opportunity to discuss with you the implications of this newest OII for EnronARM at your convenience Jeanne

<31593663.1075843006218.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-10-24 06:19:00,Re Contract for Gart Sports Cc a version of AB I refer you to pages through which discusses Sections through Residual CTCs may have two connotations The first connotation is the type of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period For example the California IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates From those frozen rates delive ry and procurement costs are subtracted What is left over residually is the recovery of CTCs The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs that are recovered after the frozen rate period Due to these two possible interpretations I believe that either the term residual CTCs needs to be defined or a better definition of the PreRolloff Period and PostRollof f Period After reading the cites that I referred to above if you believe the definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections and then I will be comfortable with the current language My concern was that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section that would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers and only benefit and protect Standard Offer customers Pursuant to Section the IOUs implemented co st recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section I a m worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a the PostRolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan s ie SDGEs rate cap You can contact Susan Mara Jeff Dasovich or Mona Petrochko in Government Affairs for better clarification if needed Edwin Essandoh AM To Tim ES cc Roger ES Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports The reference to but not including any extension pursuant to Section gii should have been deleted from the contract It was in a previou s contract which provided for an extension period but is not applicable here Tim We could forward corrected page to customer but I agree that it may not be necessary as it does not add anything but may unnecessarily alarm Customer Roger Can you suggest a definition youd be comfortable with which references the code section I have not seen the code but your point is valid although I was under the impression residual CTCs is understood i n the industry and the second issue as raisesd by Tim previously would be to maek sure an amendment to AB does not extend the PreRolloff Period My initial suggestion would be along the lines of PreRolloff Period shall mean with respect to each Facility t he period of time commencing with the Effective Date and ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs other than residual CTCs it remains authorized to collect after said date in its service territory under AB as in effect on the Effective Date but in an y event not later than March Ed Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel fax pgr To Edwin ES cc Subject Contract for Gart Sports Ed please see comments below regarding the Gart Sports contract How shou ld we handle Forwarded by Tim CarterHOUEES on AM Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports Tim Thanks for forwarding me the contract In Section a there is a definition for PostRolloff Period which states shall mean with respec t to each Facility the period of time commencing with the day after the last day of the PreRolloff Periodbut not including any extension period pursuant to Section gii The problem is that I cannot find Section gi in the contract Further the definition of PreRolloff Period which states ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs but excluding residual CTCs in its service territory under AB is ambiguous There are two possible solutions One possible solution is to define the term residual CTCs Another solution is to redraft the langua ge to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section and enacted by AB Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter PM Phone No tel fax pgr To Roger ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period ends differently than we expect The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with AB as noted in the attatched Gart contract We have however instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha t under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than I have not received a version of that contract Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book in California Correct me if I am wrong but if the end of the transition period ends earlier than priced then our mark for this deal should increas e because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a shorter period than expected Conversely if the rate freeze ends later th an how we priced it then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we had priced This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil e of our California portfolio My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is defined It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose ends Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of the transition period which is a critical date because the delivery risks hinge on that definition I just want to do some preventative maintenance such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future However we may proceed signing this contract if necessary I would just like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this deal As a matter of fact I would not even try to change the contract language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now Roger Enron Energy Services From

and competitive services the Energy Division should identify all of the assymetric rules responsibilities and expectations placed upon ESPs compared to those of the UDC default service provider For instance hourly interval metering requirements only apply to direct access customers and not to standard offer customers Costs to fulfill regulatory requirements by the ESP are expected to be recovered from market transactions whereas the utilities recover these costs in noncompetitive service rates These are examples of competitive barriers that disadvantage ESPs Secondly the decisions reference to Standby Service on page inappropriate implies that Standby Service is only available from the UDC when in fact ESPs can supply Standby Generation Service as well The issue of Standby Service needs to unbundle Standby TD service from Standby Generation service where these two issues are looked at independently Third in addressing the Distributed Generation issue of distribution service for excess generation the issue of bidirectional distribution service needs to be more fully explored In other words if the customer is expected to pay for distribution service as a load some of the costs of distribution service for excess generation should be offset by the payments already paid for distribution charges to the load Fourth the issue of voltage service levels is in part addressed with respect to interconnection Discounts for voltage service levels should be addressed with respect to both loads and generation Finally the issue of interruptible service should also be

these costs in noncompetitive service rates These are examples of competitive barriers that disadvantage ESPs Secondly the decisions reference to Standby Service on page inappropriate implies that

Residual CTCs may have two connotations The first connotation is the type of CTC recovery during the rate freeze period For example the California IOUs bill customers based on frozen rates From those frozen rates delive ry and procurement costs are subtracted What is left over residually is the recovery of CTCs The interpretation that you are implementing is the CTCs that are recovered after the frozen rate period Due to these two possible interpretations I believe that either the term residual CTCs needs to be defined or a better definition of the PreRolloff Period and PostRollof f Period After reading the cites that I referred to above if you believe the definition incorporates the guidelines implemented through Sections and then I will be comfortable with the current language My concern was that the CPUC may adopt changes to the recovery plan per Section that would disadvantage ESPs and DA customers and only benefit and protect Standard Offer customers Pursuant to Section the IOUs implemented co st recovery plans to recover costs that meet the criteria in Section I a m worried that customers may be confused by plans that may be implemented in a the PostRolloff periods that may look like the original cost recovery plan s ie SDGEs rate cap You can contact Susan Mara Jeff Dasovich or Mona Petrochko in Government Affairs for better clarification if needed Edwin Essandoh AM To Tim ES cc Roger ES Subject Re Contract for Gart Sports The reference to but not including any extension pursuant to Section gii should have been deleted from the contract It was in a previou s contract which provided for an extension period but is not applicable here Tim We could forward corrected page to customer but I agree that it may not be necessary as it does not add anything but may unnecessarily alarm Customer Roger Can you suggest a definition youd be comfortable with which references the code section I have not seen the code but your point is valid although I was under the impression residual CTCs is understood i n the industry and the second issue as raisesd by Tim previously would be to maek sure an amendment to AB does not extend the PreRolloff Period My initial suggestion would be along the lines of PreRolloff Period shall mean with respect to each Facility t he period of time commencing with the Effective Date and ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs other than residual CTCs it remains authorized to collect after said date in its service territory under AB as in effect on the Effective Date but in an y event not later than March Ed Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter AM Phone No tel fax pgr To Edwin ES cc Subject Contract for Gart Sports Ed please see comments below regarding the Gart Sports contract How shou ld we handle Forwarded by Tim CarterHOUEES on AM Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports Tim Thanks for forwarding me the contract In Section a there is a definition for PostRolloff Period which states shall mean with respec t to each Facility the period of time commencing with the day after the last day of the PreRolloff Periodbut not including any extension period pursuant to Section gii The problem is that I cannot find Section gi in the contract Further the definition of PreRolloff Period which states ending on the last day the UDC for such Facility is authorized to collect CTCs but excluding residual CTCs in its service territory under AB is ambiguous There are two possible solutions One possible solution is to define the term residual CTCs Another solution is to redraft the langua ge to be more specific referencing the PU Codes Section and enacted by AB Roger Enron Energy Services From Tim Carter PM Phone No tel fax pgr To Roger ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports You are correct regarding the impact to the mark if the transition period ends differently than we expect The contract specifies that the transition period ends in accordance with AB as noted in the attatched Gart contract We have however instructed the attorney to change the contract template to also specify tha t under no circumstances is the transition period to be later than I have not received a version of that contract Roger Yang PM To Tim ES cc Scott ES Subject Re DASH for Gart Sports I like this deal structure because it provides a hedge for our current book in California Correct me if I am wrong but if the end of the transition period ends earlier than priced then our mark for this deal should increas e because we are providing the discount off the frozen bundled price for a shorter period than expected Conversely if the rate freeze ends later th an how we priced it then the mark for this deal will decrease because we will have provided a discount off of the frozen tariff for a period longer than we had priced This impact on the mark is converse to the current risk profil e of our California portfolio My main concern is the contract language on how the transition period is defined It is important that this language is crafted to leave no loose ends Can you please send me a copy of the clauses that define the end of the transition period which is a critical date because the delivery risks hinge on that definition I just want to do some preventative maintenance such that we do not enter contract dispute over this issue in the future However we may proceed signing this contract if necessary I would just like to follow up on the issue for future deals if it is too late for this deal As a matter of fact I would not even try to change the contract language on this deal because the customer may become overly concern I recommend that Scott signs the DASH for Gart Sports for now Roger Enron Energy Services From

good intelligence for preparing our curves and pricing models however these customers are not our commercial focus and only tend to show up as a few sites in a portfolio of sites SDGEs plan was our preferred plan to the extent that the Legislature or Commission had implemented a mandatory rate cap for all size customers With respect to the larger optin customers I expect that this is only available to Standard Offer customers SDGE should prevent cost shifting to other customers who do not benefit from the cap ie SO customers who do n ot optin and DA customers who do not have the option Even customers who optin will vary by differing degrees in terms of the size of the customer and timeframe It seems to me the only equitable implementation plan for the optin customers is a customerspecific balancing account similar to that which is implemented for the balanced payment plan otherwise too much gaming will ensue which would result in the need for administratively burdensome tracking To the extent that SDGE makes all customers includi ng DA customers pay for the undercollections we can switch our customers to Standard Offer without any negative ramifications Note It would be difficult to exercise such a regulatory switching option if only those customers who benefit incur a surcharge into the future because our customers would balk at us exercising the option during our contract term a nd imposing a future liability on our customer beyond the contract term In fact it might be better if all customers were expected to pay for the undercollections so that we can exercise the regulatory switching option What do others think I think we can work with either implementation method If it is a customerspecific balancing account we will make customers know that the lower rates is the equivalent to a loan they will need to eventually pay off If it is all customers who are expected to pay we will exercise the regulatory switching option We need to be careful no t to share too much of this strategy and insights with the utility because they will counter by imposing new rules and charges for switching customers between DA and SO I dont believe that SDGEs shareholders should be held accountable for a percentage of the shortfalls This would provide a subsidy to SO service I believe it is more important that customers realize that the utilitys SO service is not the right solution versus trying to drive the utility away from SO service Either outcome works for us The last issue I will address is the timing of recovery of the undercollections Will recovery begin during the period of the cap such th at the cap will effectively be implemented as a freeze Or will the recovery begin after the cap expires resulting in otherwise higher future rates Defering cost recovery will always work to our advantage from a book perspective The key for me is to know asap the details so that we can properly model our curves for pricing new deals and reflect the changes in our book However since these questions largely pertain to the smaller customers in SDGEs service territory I do not anticipate a large impact on our book and our marketing efforts In fact I think the burdens of the modeling changes would outweigh much of the benefits of this legislation fo r us Thanks for the intelligence Roger Mona L Petrochko PM To Douglas ES James M

implement the bill He believes that th e optin provision for large CI customers and any associated undercollectio ns associated with the customers that optin would be handled separately from the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercia l customers I asked how they would collect any shortfalls It didnt soun d like they had a plan yet I suggested balancing account treatment for the customers that benefit from the optin with any shortfalls recovered as quickly as possible but no later than year Relative to ResSmall Commercial He said that SDGE will propose in response to ARM comments that the cap for res and small commercial customers would not disadvantage DA customers In other words they are concerned about the appearances that SDGEs rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and woul d make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism that in effect would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w SDGE For example If prevailing market prices were centskWh SDGEs res a nd small commercial customers would only be charged upto cents and DA customers would receive a centkWh credit against their TD charges so th at in effect there is no economic advantage to staying w SDGE However wh en it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections DA and bundled custome rs would again be treated comparably Their BIG concern

continued his commitment to easing the burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting process for new power plants One of the major achievements of this years legislative session is our aggressive response to Californias energy challenge Governor Davis said My Administration did not create this problem but we are percent committed to solving it And now after a long hot summer of unconscionab ly high energy prices relief is finally on the way AB by Assemblywoman Susan Davis DSan Diego and Senator Deirdre Alper t DCoronado will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal l business including schools and hospitals in San Diego at cents per kilowatthour These rates will be retroactive from June and extend to December In the short term this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy prices Governor Davis said When it comes to predicting their electric bills San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough This is an urgency measure I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take immediate action at its meeting tomorrow As a result of this legislation the average monthly bill for residential customers in San Diego will be reduced to Small businesses all school s and acutecare hospitals are included will pay an average monthly bill of Medium businesses consuming up to kilowatthours a month wou ld also have a price cap of cents per kilowatthour For large businesses AB would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDGE over a longer period of time AB by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny DSan Diego and Assemblyman Jim Battin RLa Quinta will help California overcome the inadequate supply of energy one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices by expediting the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for upgrades of old facilities Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those who would build more power generators in California Governor Davis said This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing demand It will also establish new programs to reduce demand Over the last three months Governor Gray Davis leadership has been demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis On June he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta te facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen cy and rolling blackouts On June he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission PUC to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa n Francisco Bay area the previous day including a statewide perspective on t he price and delivery of electricity Report was completed submitted to the governor and released on August On July Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in refunds In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two Californiabased panels charged with overseeing Californias power market he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short and longterm On August Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it take s new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies Please go to briefingexecorderindexshtm to view copi es of Governor Davis Executive Orders On August Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission PUC to establish a twoyear plan that would cut electricity rates by near ly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas Electric The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between and homes during periods of peak demand as grocers agreed to reduce power consumption by percent during Stage One emergencies On August Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi ng him to expedite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions investigation to determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust On August Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release emergency funds from the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP to the state to help lowincome Californians pay their rapidlyrising electricity bills On August President Clinton responded to Governor Davis request by releasing million in emergency funds to help lowincome Southern Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills The president also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the operation of US power markets and urged the Small Business Administration to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases On August Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers Todays bill signing is the culmination of that agreement GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

<7679868.1075843110624.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-09-21 08:25:00,PGE Strategy to End the Rate Freeze Early and Potential Book Impact Cc an email that I sent to my management earlier this week A also have a couple of questions and observations First do we have anything in writing from PGE when they refused to comply with our request to revise their Rolloff Matrix Also I spoke with Jeff who informed me of the various variables that the market has to work with to negotiate with PGE I agree with the following variables extend the rate freeze beyond but no later than the end of a to billion hydro valuation on January to cover TRA and TCBA undercollections at that point in time with future payments based on a revenue requirement calculation and a fixed rate of return These fixed payments will be offset by the wholesale market revenues for the hydro output Ratepayers will have to make up the difference in the future through a balancing account and fixed surcharge or surcredit in financial derivative terms this is is the equivalent of a negative index fixed revenue requirement market revenues presumed to be the PX This essentially NPVs the cashflows to payoff shortfalls today at the risk of creating shortfalls in the future to the extent that the value is too high increase the level of the frozen rate at some modest amount Keep in mind a per mWh increase in PGEs rates beginning January translates to a million hit to the book for through so we would need an offsetting benefit We could probably offset this hit if the rate freeze was extended through March allow PGE to hedge procurement costs for the extended frozen time period it is critical that the rate freeze does not end before July for all customers including large and small and DA and SO Preferably the rate freeze would end no earlier than December or They can also extend the rate freeze for a longer period of time for small customers or change the freeze to an SDGE type of mechanism beyond December The following is PGEs situtation As you can see that they will be trying to cut their losses even though they have still not fully collected all outstanding undercollections Undercollections are projected to grow through next year What PGE will be looking for is a way out or a swaption to switch customers from the fixed to index asap I dont think they will be so quick to do give up million at this point and will be interested in some type of settlement that would protect this amount There is still the political hot potato about rolling off early and selling out customers and the only way they could do this is with a quick valuation of hydro Maybe they would be willing to take some loss even in a settlement to avoid upsetting politicians and customers If the process is delayed PGEs exposure will probably be over billion by the end of the year and possible billion by the end of So you see there would be a need for some combination of a slight increase in rates extension of the freeze to capture the backwardation in commodity price and a higher hydro valuation with ratepayers incurring the risk for the higher valuation in the future in exchange for a deal that insulates ratepayers from volatility and rate shock today It is key that the extended Rate Freeze equitably treats DA customers in the form of todays rate freeze with a PX credit that is not capped Roger Forwarded by Roger YangSFOEES on PM Roger Yang PM To Dennis ES Scott ES cc Marty ES Subject PGE Strategy to End the Rate Freeze Early and Potential Book Impact PGE filed Advice Letter EA on September requesting to revise its hydro value estimate of a billion previously filed in June to billion retroactively effective on June Although PGE does not state the intent to end the rate freeze effective July it is clear that PGE will claim that the billion interim valuation will render the rate freeze as having ended retroactively on July if the CPUC approves this advice letter Our estimates show that this is viable however PGE will be undercollected by million in its Transition Revenue Account It is unclear whether PGE is willing to forego this undercollection in order to avoid incurring higher undercollections from the runup in electric commodity prices under a rate freeze or if PGE has some other plan to recover this undercollection as a postfreeze rate adder Even though Decision Nos and adopt ratemaking methodologies to establish an interim valuation that triggered PGEs Advice Letter filings this decision states that the CPUC will address the impact of this accounting on the end of the rate freeze at the appropriate time and in the appropriate proceeding p Hence there is no conclusive decision that states that this interim valuation should be used to end the rate freeze In fact the utilities had argued the contrary it could not be used in this manner Since PGE has already sent out bills for August and should alreay wdy have sent out bills for September by the final resolution of this Advice Letter I believe the earliest implementation date for ending the rate freeze would be October In addition I would have to believe that allowing PGE to implement an end to the rate freeze effective July would violate codes on retroactive ratemaking since it would result in an immediate increase to PGEs customers The book impact to EESI for a termination date of October would be a million loss A delay to an October end date would result in an undercollection for PGE greater than billion PGE will try to recover this undercollection in future rates if the end date is October To the extent that such recover is delayed and recovered over an extended period of time the impact on the book could be minor due to the expiration of many of our contracts in AB Section a states These frozen rate levels for each customer class rate schedule contract or tariff option shall remain in effect until the earlier of March or the date on which the commissionauthorized costs for utility generationrelated assets and obligations have been fully recovered The electrical corporation shall be at risk for those costs not recovered during that time period I interpret this to mean that the utility does not have the option to artificially end the rate freeze earlier However PGE may be trying to end the rate freeze early through an interim valuation of hydro assets AB Section a states For those assets subject to valuation the valuations used for the calculation of the uneconomic portion of the net book value shall be determined not later than December and shall be based on appraisal sale or other divestiture The commisions determination of the costs eligible for recovery and of the valuation of those assets at the time the assets are exposed to market risk or retired in a proceeding under Section or otherwise shall be final and notwithstanding Section or any other provision of law may not be rescindeded altered or amended PGEs original position was an interim valuation could not end the rate freeze when PGE had thought it could overcollect CTCs before the runup in market prices Now PGE is trying to rewrite history after the fact by using an interim valuation that is higher than their original estimate Per Decision No PGE and SCE were ordered to file an advice letter three months prior to the earliest forecasted date that the rate feeze will end or Sepetmeber if the rate freeze does not end earlyThe Advice Letter implementing rate changes shall become effective within days of the end of the rate freeze subject to Energy Division determining the Advice Letter is in compliance Ordering Paragraph To the best of my knowledge PGE has yet to file an advice letter providing months notice of an end to the rate freeze This demonstrates that PGE is taking desperate actions In that same decision the CPUC ordered that PGE and SCE shall provide to interested parties estimates of the date the rate freeze will end and file advice letters to effectuate the end of the rate freeze as set forth herein Ordering Paragraph To date every estimate filed with the CPUC showed that the rate freeze would end no earlier than January In fact Enron has notified PGE on prior occasions of the possibility of a potential earlier end date and PGE dismissed our concerns about the misinformation perpetrated by PGEs filings This demonstrates a willful act on PGEs part to commit fraud if they were to end the rate freeze before This would not be the first time that PGE has manipulated the regulatory process In its General Rate Case PGE was communicating an expectation of to rate drops at the end of the freeze which were later revised to drops The effect was to paralyze customers from choosing an alternate supplier which turns out was not in the customers best interest Finally the decision states the end of the rate freeze shall not occur before the generation assets of each utility have been marketvalued except as the law or the Commission determine otherwise Ordering Paragraph This provision clearly demonstrates that despite all of PGEs acts it will be the final decision of either the Legislature or Commission as to whether they will allow PGE to end the rate freeze retroactively without any advance notice and causing an immediate increase in utility bills to half of the customers of investorowned utilities in California If the Legislature or Commission is willing to commit this type of political suicide then PGEs grip on these bodies is tighter than we could ever imagine As opposed to PGEs desperate plans that would negatively impact California customers we willl pursue a winwin strategy Amongst various strategies would be to extend the rate freeze up to December A freeze ending any period between July and December will have a positive impact on our book Estimates from a month ago showed a positive impact in the ballpark of million if the rate freeze were to end on December Of course our preference would be to end earlier than so as to avoid a potential negative impact on future sales however we believe this PGE would require at least this time frame in order to mitigate its undercollections that it would incur for the next few years PGE will benefit by the opportunity to maximize recovery especially given an opportunity to now hedge this risk and with the hedge funded by ratepayers ENA will have the opportunity to sell to PGE Customers get a reprieve and will have an additional four years to prepare for the new market structure knowing what they may expect from the scare from this summers With a better informed customer we may even be able to still sell in California The Governor Legislature and Regulators can defer the concerns to someone elses term in office At a minimum we should try to negotiate some joint proposal with PGE that would extend the rate freeze to December or March with guaranteed recovery of undercollections for PGE for some time period beyond those dates If adopted by CPUC PGE would get the PL protection they need and customers can benefit from the reprieve from higher rates I think the key is to preserve the current AB rate freeze mechanism versus a mechanism similar to that enacted by the Legislature for SDGE because that legislation does not adequately protect all customers and competitors equally The only solution will be a winwin solution The Wall Stree Journal speculates that PGE will be reluctant to be too aggressive in selling out customers and may be positioning itself to negotiate a winwin solution We need to make sure we are part of that winning solution if not influence that solution Moodys Investor Services Inc issued a negative outlook on PGE and PGEs stock price has dropped from to

penalize customers for failing to curtail during Stage conditions This may be detrimental to EESI to the extent the customer does not curtail and EESI is expected to cover the cost of the penalties per our contract with the customer This penalty is unacceptable if we are expected by the customer to pay the penalties The plan does provide for putting the customer in a Rotating Outage queue if the customers fails to curtail on two occassions In my opinion there should not be any financial penalties and instead the customer is switched immediately to a Rotating Outage queue if the customer fails

<25041942.1075843122691.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,roger.yang@enron.com,2000-10-12 07:45:00,Re OII into the Operation of Interruptible Load Programs of SDGE S CE and PGE Cc that the decision was made to not comment due to customer relations concerns This is probably wise My take on our deals with interruptible customers is that we priced deals assuming that the customer would stay on an interruptible rate schedule and abide by the terms of that schedule and all tariff rules for that schedule through the expiration date of the schedule on March per PU Code Section These interruptible programs are programs administered by the local distribution company based on decisions to interrupt from the ISO As I understand the decisions to interrupt is based on system reliability issues thereby justifying recovery of the cost of the program from all customers whom benefit from system reliability The customers decision to contract with the LDC to be on an interruptible schedule and in some cases contract with an ESP under the assumption that the customer remains on the schedule is primarily an issue between the customer and the LDC If a customer elects to not abide by the terms of the rate schedule the customer should be responsible for the consequences Hopefully are contract language specifies that the customer must pay the penalties for defaulting on rules for interruptible service I dont know how tight are contract language is with respect to the expectation to stay on interruptible service through March and passing through penalties If one of customers elect to leave the interruptible schedule before March I presume this would be grounds for nullifying the contract or renegotiating the contract In addition to the system reliability reasons for curtailing it looks like the utilities ISO and CPUC are looking for curtailment programs as demandresponsiveness programs in order to mitigate purported supplyside market power and reduce prices to California Under the current crisis this is a good thing The question is who pays for these programs I have heard arguments that all loads should pay since all loads benefit from the externalities of lower prices from lower demands This is only true for those loads be supplied by the spot market On the other hand we have made the argument that only those customers that directly benefit should pay for the cost of the program In other words a program for SO customers should be funded by SO customers because the cost of programs sponsored by ESPs for DA customers are not recovered from SO customers I think that we need to divide this issue into a solution and longerterm solution Arguable the and perhaps solutions are to benefit all load including DA so long as the current rate freeze structure is maintained However in a postfreeze structure the policy should probably be that only those who directly benefit should pay Another longterm policy guideline should be based on participation In other words eligibility of participation should also determine whether DA customers should also pay for the program Direct Benefits Eligible to Participate Who pays LDC Administered Program to address System Reliability All Customers All Customers with the proper metering and telemetry All Customers LDC Administered Program to address economic conditions under current market conditions and current rate freeze structure All Customers so long as the rate freeze is maintained and prices are high SO customers with proper metering and telemetry If all Customers must pay then the program should accommodate participation by DA customers as well LDC in a default provider role administered program to address postfreeze economic conditions SO Customers SO Customers SO Customers ESP Administered Program to address postfreeze economic conditions DA Customer DA Customer DA Customer It is important to make the distinction in what capacity is the LDC administering interruptible programs as seen above Also it is important to understand the role of SCs and the ISO SCs are just the vehicle by which ESPs and wholesale marketers implement DA curtailment programs and participate in ISO and PX markets for energy and ancillary services The ISO like the utilities wears two hats The ISO implements directions to the LDCs to curtail based on a last resort need to curtail The ISO is also trying to develop market solutions involving SCs and the LDC in their role as a default provider in order to avoid having to issue general directions to utilities to curtail The utility similarly tries to first use interruptible rate schedules then as a last resort relies on rolling blackouts It may be important to determine what category do new LDC programs fit into in the shortrun and the longrun What are our plans to participate and help California clearly define these issues Any thoughts Roger Mona L Petrochko AM To Harry ES Roger Yang cc West GA Subject OII into the Operation of

into the Operation of Interruptible Load Programs of SDGE S CE and PGE The Commission is looking to suspend the termination of interruptible contracts by requiring existing participating customers to

S CE and PGE Sue Mona Jeff and Sandi Mike and I wanted to give you a preview of the Commissions latest actions in response to the crisis in the California electric market In short the Commission has instituted an Investigation in to operation of the interruptible load programs of the three UDCs and the effect of these programs on energy prices other demand responsiveness programs and the reliability of the electric system The item which has gotten the most press from the OII so far is the proposed temporary suspension of the tariff provisions of the three UDCs that allow customers to opt out of their interruptible program contracts during the day window commencing November st The Commission is using its authority under PUC Section which gives the Commission specific authority to amend interruptible contracts between the UDCs and qualified heavy industrials to propose such suspension Although parties are allowed to comment on the suspension by this Thursday the th the Commission does have the apparent authority to effect the change and it will most likely proceed with the suspension Apart from the enforced extension of the interruptible contracts however the OII potentially could have broader ramifications The intent of the OII is to examine all interruptible curtailable and demand responsiveness programs being currently offered andor proposed in California and to determine how these programs can best be structured andor reformulated to serve the Commissions goal of ensuring reliable and reasonably priced electric service within California especially for the summer of It is hard to tell exactly what the Commission has in mind However it is possible that such reformulation of curtailabledemand responsiveness programs could interfere with Enrons and other ESPs ability to make interruptible demand responsive deals with customers Moreover the OII is not merely looking at larger customers It states as one of the purposes of the rulemaking the identification of if and how smaller customers can participate in curtailable programs Specifically the OII states that we need to examine the ability of smaller customers to participate the development of rate design and incentive polices of such participation a costbenefit analysis of such programs and the marketing of any such programs Such investigation and potential implementation of demand responsiveness programs for smaller customers could impact and interfere with ARMs attempts to structure a competitive default provider program We would like the opportunity to discuss with you the implications of this newest OII for EnronARM at your convenience Jeanne
