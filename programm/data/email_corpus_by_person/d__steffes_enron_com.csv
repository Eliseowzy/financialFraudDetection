for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and

Original Message From Shapiro Richard Sent Friday July PM To Steffes James D Subject FW Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments Original Message From Novosel Sarah Sent Friday July AM To Robertson Linda Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Subject Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments Forwarded by Sarah NovoselCorpEnron on AM EMILY HARRIS AM To cc Andrea Settanni Subject Portland General Electric Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments FERC UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Before Commissioners Curt Hbert Jr Chairman William L Massey Linda Breathitt Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell Portland General Electric Company Docket No ER Enron Power Marketing Inc Docket No ER ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT PREJUDICE Issued July In this order we reject without prejudice proposed amendments of Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI and Portland General Electric PGE to their respective marketbased rate tariffs that would allow them to make interaffiliate sales using the EnronOnline trading platform I Background On May in separate filings affiliates PGE in Docket No ER and EPMI in Docket No ER collectively Applicants filed to amend their respective market based rate schedules to allow for interaffiliate sales through the EnronOnline trading platform and to prohibit communication among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on EnronOnline This amendment does not supplant the existing provisions of PGEs and EPMIs currently effective tariffs which allow for interaffiliate sales subject to conditions that the Commission generally imposes on interaffiliate sales where there are captive customers eg allowing a public utility to sell to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges nonaffiliates requiring simultaneous offers to nonaffiliates or requiring use of a relevant established index Rather PGE and EPMI propose to amend their respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks an Enron Corp subsidiary EnronOnline is a free Internet based transaction system which allows EPMIs customers to view real time prices from EPMIs traders and transact instantly online EnronOnline is not an EPMI application but rather EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in buying from and selling power to third parties Docket Nos ER and ER interaffiliate sales via EnronOnline with restrictions different than those in place but that they state will still prevent affiliate abuse Applicants state that the Commissions requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in electronic commerce and in particular the Commissions requirement that PGE post on its website notice of a potential purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline since EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not provide for a waiting period before consummating the transaction According to Applicants this deprives PGE of the ability to buy or sell power from perhaps the largest marketer in its region to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers II Notice of Filing and InterventionsProtests Notices of the filings were published in the Federal Register Fed Reg Docket No ER and Fed Reg Docket No ER with motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before June None was filed III Discussion The Commission allows power marketers and their public utility affiliates to sell to one another at marketbased rates when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate abuse As the Commission has explained affiliate abuse can occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers sells power at belowmarket prices to or purchases power at abovemarket prices from an affiliate without captive customers such as a power marketer affiliate One way in which the Commission has sought to prevent this type of crosssubsidization by captive customers is to require the pricing of interaffiliate sales at an established relevant market price or index Another way when there is no assurance that the affiliates are transacting at the prevailing market price is to adopt various conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse EPMI Application at PGE Application at EPMI Application at PGE Application at See eg DPL Energy Inc FERC accord First Energy Trading Services Inc FERC at Eg GPU Advanced Resources Inc FERC at continued Docket Nos ER and ER Here Applicants request that the Commission permit them to use EnronOnline to make interaffiliate sales subject to the following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient protection against affiliate abuse PGE when buying from EPMI using EnronOnline will be required to take the transaction price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment In addition PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders or engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity of the counterparty is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction being finalized Applicants also propose to amend their respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication regarding prices posted on EnronOnline Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at continued GPU Detroit Edison Company FERC at Detroit Edison In GPU the Commission allowed sales from a power marketer to its affiliated traditional public utility at a rate that was no higher than the lowest rate the public utility paid nonaffiliates under certain standard supplier agreements Accord First Energy Trading Power Marketing Inc FERC at rehg denied FERC Detroit Edison provided that a traditional public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non affiliates that the utility simultaneously offer through its electronic bulletin board to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to its affiliate and that all prices charged to the affiliate be simultaneously posted on its electronic bulletin board Accord Jersey Central Power Light Co FERC at Commonwealth Edison Co FERC at EPMI Application at PGE Application at In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline EPMI would know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or lower than that currently available Applications at While Applicants do not define Limit Order the common understanding is that unlike a market order which instructs a broker to transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in the marketplace a limit order instructs a broker to fill the order only if certain conditions are met Generally a limit order may be either a day order in which case it expires when the market closes if unfilled or gooduntilcanceled in which case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled Docket Nos ER and ER the posted price a price that is offered to all market participants and there will be no transactions in which EPMI knows that PGE is the counterparty before the transaction is finalized Thus Applicants contend that not only will PGE be unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of PGE In addition because the EnronOnline price is posted electronically and is available to all market participants Applicants state that PGEs customers have the opportunity to transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and conditions that are available to PGE Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the Commissions affiliate abuse requirements and conditions eg protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its transactions with its affiliate EPMI The thrust of Applicants argument is that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline a public medium for selling power between affiliates We disagree While perhaps faster and easier to use than phone calls faxes or letters an Internetbased platform is just another medium for trade and speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commissions affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied There is for example no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline represent prevailing market prices Applicants contend that since PGE can transact with EPMI via EnronOnline only at the posted price there can be no affiliate abuse We are not certain however that the posted price necessarily represents the market price While on the surface Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an auction the posted prices for any product may not be the result of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers in fact for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to sell at and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to buy at For other transactions through media other than EnronOnline including other exchanges EPMI might be See supra notes and accompanying text citing cases that discuss Commissions underlying concerns with affiliate power sales See supra note and accompanying text All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a participant For sales EPMI is the seller For purchases EPMI is the buyer Docket Nos ER and ER willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices Moreover Applicants provide no information about how product prices posted by EPMI are determined or whether there would be any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via EnronOnline or even whether there are other similar but non affiliated Internetbased venues where PGE can electronically trade those products to attain similar benefits Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline we now turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE through EnronOnline there is nothing in the Applicants proposed restrictions that would require PGE to simultaneously offer to sell to nonaffiliates at the same rate offered to the affiliate The Commission requires that with respect to any power offered to its affiliate PGE make the same offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its electronic bulletin board But it is unclear whether PGE can or will make the same offer to nonaffiliates Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited from submitting Limit Orders which would prevent EPMI from knowing that PGE is the counterparty to a transaction Again this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above market prices The Commission is not assured by the Applicants proposal that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commissions expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for interaffiliate power sales transactions There is for example no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how unaffiliated customers or other interested parties would monitor interaffiliate transactions For the above reasons we will reject the proposed amendments without prejudice to Applicants revising their proposal to address the Commissions concerns and incorporating appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse Likewise PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and sell at higher prices Docket Nos

Kitchen Louise Dietrich Janet Mara Susan Robertson Linda Kingerski Harry Denne Karen Palmer Mark A PR Shapiro Richard Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Subject Important Update on California Legislation Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzbergs chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today With respect to DA the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend DA The Governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize So it looks like the Governors plan is to have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of and have the PUC temporarily suspend DA from September to Were continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August yesterday will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs behalf between Jan and the date of the switch The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept be responsible for DWR going forward contracts though details of how that would work were not clear The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August rd date is to prevent a rush to Direct Access between now and Sept There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept Finally the bill apparently will also give selfgeneration priority over Direct Access in each open season The bill would set aside MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen If the self gen is not subscribed the MWs would go to DA The bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly The politicians are very reluctant to pass any Edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing But the Governor is working the bill very hard Mirant is actively working against the bill Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose reelection Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes The bill also has to make it through the Senate Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President John Burton who said flatly that hes not doing anything But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is With respect to the bills provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers Edison also said that under the Assembly version of the bill Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds More info to follow as it becomes available If anyone has any questions dont hesitate to contact me Best Jeff Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday August PM To Dasovich Jeff Subject Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis and Hertzbergs staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers They also said that favorable provisions with respect to selfgen would also be added to the bill They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow Note In addition to the DA provisions the bill also includes provisions that explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edisons undercollection and permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of Edisons debt for Edisons management and shareholders to address Summary of Direct Access provisions The program would begin January Its unclear what would happen to DA between now and January Presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the California PUC days after the effective date of the bill and every months thereafter DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position Every months the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA KWandabove customers would have days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season under kw customers would have days Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying the customers proportionate share of the utilitys undercollection and the customers proportionate share of DWRs receivables if any for power previously delivered by DWR but not yet fully paid for by customers In addition if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed Best Jeff

Badeer Robert Williams III Bill Mallory Chris Denne Karen Belden Tim Yoder Christian Sanders Richard B Subject As the CAISO Turns CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWRs longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the email from our CAISO representative Original

Volume Management who first brought this scam to my attention Original Message From Blair Kit Sent Thursday August PM To Hall Steve C Legal Cc DLPortland Volume Mgmt Subject Revelation Steve Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

Original Message From Dadson Aleck Sent Tuesday August AM To Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Subject FW Ontario Market Opening Strategy Importance High As I discussed earlier with Rick sasha Jacob is leaving GPC at the end of the month to join another firm sash is particularly valuable becuase of his impeccable connections with Jim Wilson the Minister of energy and the staffers on the government side of the Legislature What I wouldnt mind talking through with you is the continuing need for assistance re the media here as Tom McLaren proposes I think we need it and Peter Varley would be good to work with in that regard he is the Premiers former Press Secretary and has conections with the major Toronto dilies that have proved helpful Original Message From McLaren Tom mailto Sent Tuesday August AM To Dadson Aleck Subject Ontario Market Opening Strategy Importance High Aleck Further to our phone call as promised I am sending you this email to confirm our interest in ensuring that Enron Canada can secure the consulting resources it requires at the current time to ensure an expeditious and assured opening of Ontarios electrical power market As well as you know we have superior resources in Alberta and elsewhere to augment your government relations media and public affairs resources I would like to meet with you today or early Wednesday to discuss an amended goingforward task assignment for GPC given the likelihood of assigning the Queens Park contact program to Sasha or his new firm I would ask that should you be successful in concluding an engagement agreement with Sasha or his firm that you inform us and I will have our inhouse counsel confirm the removal of any restrictive covenants that Sasha has with GPC that would prevent him from doing consulting work with you While the contact program you want Sasha to work on is key to your objectives it is nonetheless only one element of a comprehensive campaign so whatever your arrangements with Sasha or his firm may be we see GPCs critical areas of support as follows GPC would continue to provide strategic advice on the overall program to secure Enron Canadas market opening in Ontario including advice to you on the Queens Park Contact Program Assuming that you will be working with Sasha to execute the Queens Park contact program we still believe that our assessment of the situation will be very valuable particularly with the opposition parties and for giving you an independent back channel to gauge your success GPC would also provide advice to you on the management of other important stakeholders such the municipal utilities major power consumers consumer and environmentalsocial advocates and others who may slow down or derail the market reforms Regarding the opposition parties we endorse your strategy of maintaining the current support of the Official Opposition Liberals GPC is well positioned to assist in this political arena It should be separated from the government program in our view if possible The media will also perform a pivotal role in shaping the publics understanding of the issue In this respect we would recommend that GPCs Peter Varley assist you Our approach would be to ensure that the major media outlets in key government constituencies are targeted to have an accurate and favourable response to Enron Canadas position Ideally we would work to ensure that these outlets are proactively supportive of the market opening in their respective editorial positions and that Enron is a preferred media contact This would enable you be in a better position to shape the media debate To accomplish this we would recommend both a proactive and reactive approach ie media plan contact program program delivery and daytoday monitoring and rapid response Aleck this is much like we did for project Stanley GPC would also develop all collateral materials for all audiences including the media government regulators and market stakeholders This would include briefing notes QA media releases policy papers etc Outside Ontario there are other concerns including some current issues underway in Alberta which Enron Canada should be alerted to from time to time and GPC can help you understand those concerns as they arise and assess the value of strategic intervention As we discussed I will be the overall account manager for GPC and I strongly recommend that you Sasha and I meet as a team twice a month to coordinate our efforts and to exchange intelligence I have also reviewed our current contractual arrangement with you our letter agreement from June and I believe a new contract is not required as our current contract would seem to be appropriate It sets out a comprehensive set of deliverables which covers all the points I have outlined above and an agreed understanding between you and me on a budget will fit within the terms of that contract Once again Aleck thanks for your support and patience and as you can tell we value your business very highly I will call you to set up a convenient time to meet to ensure this overview is consistent with our discussions and also to review with you the members of the GPC team Tom McLaren Executive Vice

the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge nerators may have withheld power the basic argument is that DEREGULATIO N ITSELF NOT FAIL RATHER IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED In addition the paper states that MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIAS ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE S TO THE STATES RESTRUCTURING PLAN BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE ELECTRICIT Y DEREGULATION In addition Californias response of DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the States poor plan and actions created the financi al and political crisis The CBO finds that WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKETbecause FEATURES OF THE RESTR UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out toge ther with our details of the policy failures This CBO report clearly und ercuts the political arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l ongterm contracts but has passed

Crisis by the CBO Subject to receiving more information my recommendation is not to make a federal case out of the CBO report In other words we should be aware of Daves comments and concerns but I would not suggest we contact CBO or an ything like that If others think some response is needed this is the typ e of thing EPSA should do if done at all We should refrain from carrying water for the generators The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen largely because the CBO report says that what Cal ifornia did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by dere gulation That feet view is worth a mint politically and while th ere are parts of the report that we differ with I think its value far outw eighs its blemishes Original Message From Perrino Dave SentTuesday October PM ToShelk John CcRobertson Linda Steffes James D SubjectRE Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis by the CBO John My take on the paper is that is wasnt particularly flattering to the gener atorssuppliers It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement It is reasonably sound as f ar as history of the formation is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with Off the top of my head they use the term idle In my mind as a utility person idle means available but just not running As they apply the term they use it to describe any unit not running either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance I realize its only a word but it carries many different inferences mostly unfavorable Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su pply to manipulate the price They never substantiate this claim In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric es but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und erstood the full picture They also dont really touch on the lack of supp ly side response According to Greg Conlin the President of the PUC when AB in CA was designed was a key part to the equation they spend litt le if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed Th ey also give insuffucient explaination of the perse reasonablness clause There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later ti me I left my notes on the document back in my office I can give you a summary early next week if thats OK I am currently

by the CBO Jim Last week some time I had been on the distribution of a paper published by the CBO entitled Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis In re viewing this paper several things struck me The paper is not particularly accurate they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse they ign ore the lack of implementation of demandside response programs that were s upposed to be a integral part of the AB and they use inappropriate term s such as Idle when describing plants that were unavailable because of m aintenance or repair My reason for writing is to ask you how politically influential is a paper like this Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA And if so because of some of the misrepresentations it contains do we want to develop a fact sheet for our folks in DC to use to refute some of the claims made in this paper Thanks Dave David F Perrino Director

deregulation unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians It hasnt MATTHEW C QUINN STAFF Nov Atlanta JournalAtlanta Constitution Home Page E Copyright The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas theres widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to million homes and businesses the goal was to drive prices down and improve service Instead heres what resulted A relentless wave of billing errors confusion and customer service complaints Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winters record cold Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills Three marketers have gone bankrupt reducing competition Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong No easy fixes are at hand No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what theyve had to go through said Paula G Rosput chief executive of AGL Resources parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers Rosput who joined the company in when deregulation was already under way now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably swimming against the tide Georgias relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit she said Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly Theres plenty of blame to go around here she said noting that never in the history of Georgia has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide Gov Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers but he has profound concerns about the impact on consumers Barnes said hes not out to scrap deregulation Thats a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in According to Atlanta Gas Light more than consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored except in certain hardship cases The PSC has allocated million to help lowincome senior citizens pay their bills and the federal government has kicked in million for lowincome families but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers As a result social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers The Sullivan Center a southwest Atlanta nonprofit is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills Many of them havent paid since last winters frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut offs but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term When the moratorium expired in April more than customers were targeted for disconnection and marketers were stuck with a reported million in bad debt Since then homes and businesses have been shut off of those were reconnected after paying their bills Nancy D Coveny executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry which offers assistance to lowincome residents said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies Before deregulation it was a lot easier to straighten out problems Coveny said We would call Atlanta Gas Light We had relationships High prices Jessie Champion of southwest Atlanta said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a bill dating back months Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light and was told by the company that the computer messed up Shes been using an electric heater for her household which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son Catherine LandWaters vice presidentcustomer service at Georgia Natural Gas said Champions service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas even though she sent a check Service was restored two days later but only after she yelled and screamed and complained to the PSC I have to have gas she said I have seven children Dave Benfield a spokesman for Infinite said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection The small Floridabased marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment If people dont pay us in days they get a notice Benfield said In most cases they pay The PSC has logged more than complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing billing inaccuracies disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications People arent being treated right says PSC member Stan Wise a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out and complaints to the PSC have tapered off What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months residential prices charged by marketers remained high Last week wholesale prices shot up percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch Its not clear how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley Reeling from bad debt Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price which was not heavily promoted as an option A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was compared with an average of for six regulated utilities in nearby states Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service plus Atlanta Gas Lights distribution charges PSC member Robert Baker says AGLs charges which account for percent of typical bills may be partly to blame for high bills On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to million a year above whats authorized the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates AGL meanwhile claims its entitled to a rate increase of up to million With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers its hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas What was supposed to be Georgias gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted That touched off an array of billing problems and errors When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed many consumers already angered by the billing problems blamed deregulation and didnt pay their bills While those problems were evolving in Georgia California had its electricity implosion Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation theyd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services including electricity and telecommunications But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power said Warren Darby retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia SC When Georgias moratorium on shutoffs expired in April marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated million in bad debt Instead of building market share they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality Darby said Shell Energy an affiliate of Shell Oil Co recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas The crash program by Georgias No marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints Darby said Shell is circling the wagons Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia has not been an exciting profit picture for us but he insists his company has no plans to pull out He added however Unless things get better no company can survive this Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer has been one big headache for AGL Resources its parent which recently took a million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner Its not been a good business for us said Rosput of AGL No marketer Scana Energy has reported million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year or about per month per customer after accounting for bad debt The South Carolinabased company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses The company says its in for the long term New Power Co made a late and aggressive entry into Georgias natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets Wall Street didnt like the idea The companys stock has plunged from a year ago to less than Its top financial backer Enron Corp last month wrote down about million of its investment But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that its not planning to pull out Still theres concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business The ranks of marketers has already thinned from three years ago to eight The top four control percent of the market PSC member Baker already sees an oligopoly with limited competition Consumer choice is supposed to be the hallmark of deregulation said Commissioner David Burgess Instead he said consumers have less and less Reregulation calls So far no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems Calls for reregulation are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January Already a key backer of the deregulation law has jumped ship We cant let Georgia consumers suffer for another year said state Sen Sonny Perdue of Bonaire who said he will introduce legislation to reregulate natural gas Perdue the main Senate sponsor of the deregulation law is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor He would oppose Barnes State Rep Jimmy Skipper DAmericus the main House sponsor of the law said hes concerned about gas prices but hes not sure reregulation is doable at this point Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance We believe a year from now weather permitting that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems including dilemma No If its reregulated who takes the ball says PSC Chairman Lauren Bubba McDonald Jr Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for million customers which was turned over to marketers Then theres the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a bailout to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light or even a marketer offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated Other measures could include new standards for billing customer service and meter reading more authority for the PSC including emergency power to regulate prices reducing the sales tax for gas bills and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for fixing deregulation In fact there may be no good fix Rosput said shes prepared to get to a solution but like everyone else she doesnt have an answer It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship she said and theres no safe shore or good place to land

Barnes Lynnette Subject IMPORTANT Illinois Creditworthiness Issues Unlike TX creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers ARES in IL is not uniform accross utility lines The creditworthiness standards vary by utility and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES However the single billing option SBO has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative Enrons Credit Rating of BBBSP and BaaMoodys General Creditworthiness Under Section Subchapter C of the IL Admin Code as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement In IL EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of MW or more To secure this license EES was required to post bond in the sum of The bond is valid for one year and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES If the license bond is cancelled modified expires or is drawn upon EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount The EES license bond expired on June EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June and annually thereafter Registration Under SubPart B EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only nonresidential customers with maximum demand of MW or more Subpart B has additional financial qualifications To maintain certification under Subpart B EES needs to maintain at least one of the following longterm credit ratings of BBB SP Baa Moodys BBB Duff Phelps or BBB Fitch or Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall not be less than or of EES revenue for last fiscal year or Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in an amount not less than or of EESs revenue for the last fiscal year or Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES contractual failure This certification shall be covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in the sum of times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next months multiplied by the average of the highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year or EES maintains a line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of or of its revenue for last fiscal year from an A rated financial insitution or EES earns points on the financial ratios pretax interest coverage funds from operations interest coverage funds from operations to total debt and total debt to total capital Enrons Credit Rating and downgrades To satisfy the Subpart B requirements EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp Given our current credit rating of BBBSP and Baa Moodys that guaranty is still valid However if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness IMPACT The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EESs ability to do business in IL Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical Please note that EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP Single Bill Option Pursuant to Section Subpart F any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option SBO must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities monies that it collects under the SBO tariff To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards EES must either Post and maintain bond in the amount of of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an A rating Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings a BBB SP Baa Moodys BBBduff Phelps BBB Fitch Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings Enrons Current Rating EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings EES is not rated However given Enron Corps current credit rating of BBB and Baa a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff Further Downgrades If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings EES will need to provide a bond or LC or forego the SBO option IMPACT EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical However there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables Instrument Fund Charges akin to stranded costs Under the Illinois tariffs EES can choose annually one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges To remit IFC charges within days of receipt of customer payment or more frequently as required or within days of utility invoicing whether or not customer has paid If EES chooses the nd option it has to provide a security deposit equal to one months estimated IFC charges for all EES customers Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage and the IFC charge per KWH If the expected IFC charge for EES customers is or more this deposit amount will be revised monthly If EES chooses the nd option remittance of bills within days of utility invoicing we will be required to provide the deposit IMPACT This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd For ComEd IFC charges nets out to zero and customers do not pay those charges EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IPs service territory and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement However this may have operational implications

the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge nerators may have withheld power the basic argument is that DEREGULATIO N ITSELF NOT FAIL RATHER IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED In addition the paper states that MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIAS ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE S TO THE STATES RESTRUCTURING PLAN BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE ELECTRICIT Y DEREGULATION In addition Californias response of DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the States poor plan and actions created the financi al and political crisis The CBO finds that WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKETbecause FEATURES OF THE RESTR UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out toge ther with our details of the policy failures This CBO

would not suggest we contact CBO or an ything like that If others think some response is needed this is the typ e of thing EPSA should do if done at all We should refrain from carrying water for the generators The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen largely because the CBO report says that what Cal ifornia did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused

Dave SentTuesday October PM ToShelk John CcRobertson Linda Steffes James D SubjectRE Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis by the CBO John My take on the paper is that is wasnt particularly flattering to the gener atorssuppliers It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement It is reasonably sound as f ar as history of the formation is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with Off the top of my head they use the term idle In my mind as a utility person idle means available but just not running As they apply the term they use it to describe any unit not running either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance I realize its only a word but it carries many different inferences mostly unfavorable Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su pply to manipulate the price They never substantiate this claim In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric es but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und erstood the full picture They also dont really touch on the lack of supp ly side response According to Greg Conlin the President of the PUC when AB in CA was designed was a key part to the equation they spend litt le if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed Th ey also give insuffucient explaination of the perse reasonablness

be a integral part of the AB and they use inappropriate term s such as Idle when describing plants that were unavailable because of m aintenance or repair My reason for writing is to ask you how politically influential is a paper like this Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA And if so

arrange a brief call for u s with Stacey Elliot Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strateg y going forward Jennifer Overall Concerns The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilat eral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid p resents limitations and could drive up costs Its unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from the underlying commodity The above requirement indicates that it is not This would negatively impact and even negate the main reasons to have a R EC trading program to provide flexibility and act as verification for the RPS The biomass definition is too limiting Would be difficul t to detail this amount of information on a REC Need to have language tha t distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed lan guage in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Departm ent of Water Resources SB only is instructed to purchase renewables o n their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the

probability of success of being signed by the Governor the customer would pay for SCE undercollection PGE isnt being discussed on this piece DWR bond costs and DWR net unavoidable The hardest piece to calculate which Belden said on the last call he simply couldnt given the tremendous uncertainty is the DWR net unavoidable If the customer has been DA since July the customer could avoid the DWR net unavoidable but the legislation could change or not pass and the CPUC could do something else Each customer needs to appreciate this latest information and make a determination about what these amounts will be the key question Id ask a customer is that they need to try and keep their options open Of course all of this assumes that the CPUC doesnt go back and suspend DA even earlier than July

swirling around There is legislation pending right now as I write this email The outcome is uncertain But here is what I know and what I have been working on for BOMA First the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September th including any DA contract signed since last January The PUC has threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending action on the issue by the legislature Even if the PUC were to act the legislature could override their action with a statute But I anticipate that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September th The real action is in the legislature There is a comprehensive bill SB XX the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen the Governor and the Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison Here are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it The state would securitize billion in bonds to help SCE pay its debts Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use kW or more in peak daily demand That would translate to about as in ths of a penny per kW The original proposal was to place the bailout burden only on SCE customers who use kW peak demand which would have been maybe cents per kW since the base would have been much smaller but we beat that back to the current proposal of kW The Edison surcharge would be nonbypassable That means that Edison customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or from a DA contractor If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand load which exceeds supply as calculated as follows DWR contracts IOU retained generation IOU long term contracts If this delta or headroom exists as of then per PUC regswhich are yet to be devloped the Calif Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount of headroom without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee An exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a customer for the customers proportional share of the states stranded costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR but for which there is no market If no headroom exists a customer still could go DA but pay the exit fee to do so A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to to continue without penalty It looks like contracts signed between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty but that date is not definite Contracts signed between June and August th would also be permitted but may have to pay some sort of retroactive exit fee on a sliding scale depending on the date they were signed All DA contracts after August th would be subject to the schedule described in above In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers and exit fees for DA customers when no headroom exists there will be another surcharge for all nonmunicipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since January th That surcharge would be to payoff billiion in state revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR bought since January Where does BOMA and the rest of the business community stand on these issues BOMA has been OK with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market power While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR long term contracts we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for them and wants to be held harmless for their costs BOMA and other business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without exit fees BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any surplus electricity revenues after the first million to ratepayers based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate payments This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on customers who have experienced rate increases greater than in the last few months Finally BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison But the Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone he can see including all business groups to help get it enacted In that light BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers residential as well as business pay the debt The legislature however did not want to pass this cost on to residential customers so then it became a fight over where the consumer threshold would be As stated above we have suceeded in getting it as low as kW peak demand NOTE There are those that feel it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to get the state out of the energy business You can decide for yourselves It should also be noted that the Edison bond and DWR surcharges may all be covered in the existing rates you are now paying That is to say that there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since the market price for power has come down substantially But this remains to be seen There is more to this package and moer to come in terms of changes The committee is going back in at this evening and we will see what happens I hope tis helps you in understanding the situation Les Spahnn The information contained in this communication may be confidential is intended only for the use of the

see Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our MMBtuday of Block capacity on El Paso In fact I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March even before we signed up for the capacity You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far Original Message From Lawner Leslie Sent Wednesday September PM To Cantrell Rebecca W Miller Stephanie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies Their concern is not the same as PGEs And to the extent anything is agreed to reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms and I dont think we want to go there We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PGE and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived Original Message From Cantrell Rebecca W Sent Wednesday September AM To Miller Stephanie Cc Lawner Leslie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP Steph Leslie and I were just talking about this and one thing we need to keep in mind is that

capacity in light of the dueling recall rights but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more Original Message From Lawner Leslie Sent Tuesday September AM To Miller Stephanie Cc Cantrell Rebecca W Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP As to the hour recall I can only tell you what the FERC order says I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the recall to work The order is fairly terse and just says and if it so recalled by PGE that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PGE service territory upon hours notice The language says to me that you can recall it hours before you want to use it However I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it As to the traditional rate making valuation of the million I have to confess I dont understand what you mean PGE paid the million as part of a negotiated settlement Typically that is part of a black box settlement meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment but I would doubt it If your question relates to how PGE is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out Original Message From Miller Stephanie Sent Tuesday September AM To Lawner Leslie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP When is the hour notice on rerecall effective hours from the day of recall varies depending on term or hours before the recall is supposed to start How would you value whats left of the million that PGE paid based upon traditional rate making policies

the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago Alt hough I did not see the word congestion the implication of what I read i s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i mpacts that it makes on the grid The implication of the last statement is that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in b ut for the new generator That is great assuming I did not skim from too high an altitude Did I I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott en about until recently That is if the generator pays for all of this up grade and but for stuff and then gives it to the utility are there ta xes due on the gift When we developed our project in Pittsburg CA PG Es initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax es on the upgrades about additional charge which they turned ov er to the state and fed This is potentially A LOT of money to waste on an interconnect if it is an expensive one Working with Enrons tax dep t I do not remember specifically with whom we convinced PGE that taxes were probably not due for various reasons and we mutually agreed to get a private letter ruling from the IRS confirming We also agreed that IF the taxes were ever due that we would pay them I understand that that IRS ruling was put in abeyance pending some sort of law congress was consideri ng I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the project from us and I lost track of the various machinations The point of all of this Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t o address the tax issue Is it too late Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro cess Does anyone know the status of the law making process I am concerned about taxes for two reasons First many of the opponents t o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid for by the utility and included in rate base In other words all gener ators are good and benefit the ratepayers On fundamental grounds they w ill resist paying for upgrades If they believe that they will get the ins ult after injury treatment pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades they will resist the NOPR more strenously FYI to everyone Calpine str ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it And guess what Now with all of the new plants MW added by Calpine within a mile area of MW of existing there are congestion problem s around all of the projects just as we forecasted ISO is now considerin g adding a new zone andor charging PGE andor the projects for congestion Because PGE did not and probably never will in our lifetime add the g rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase the projects will be hurt Beca use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project in a timely manner this outcome exactly as we had forecasted is why we s upported the approach in the proposed NOPR Second perhaps naively I am assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than for electric transmission system upgrades On a project we are now develo ping in Roseville CA we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up grades in PGEs system Significant grossups for tax impacts of the gift are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburgs electric transmissi on system upgrades Since it sounds like the same issue sure would be nic e if we could get some appropriate precedence going Any possibliity of de aling with the tax

Report CN summary The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation JUDGES FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo del the one Enron likes best to fullest extent possible and that remainin g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process Ho wever since complete consensus was not reached FERC should provide its de termination of which of the two models best meets FERCs expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO This should be done by FERC quickly There should be no further delay Regardless of the model FERC should enc ourage the collaborative process She thinks that this should be done by t he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER C orders I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down Parties should reconvene within days after FERCs order adopting a m odel and the FERC order should direct the participants like us to submit a joint proposal within days thereafter She recommends to FERC that pa rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within days however she reco mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations may reject he r recommendations or change something I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations while allowing further mediatedt ype discussions on some issues hopefully FERC will adopt many of our sugg ested changes Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern etal group then provides the stakeholde r participants comments almost verbatim from all submissions to her Wh ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly she does not ad opt any timeframes we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec Day start date for LMPfinancial rights congestion model to be implemented The attachments below are her report the Southern etal proposal and the G rid pricing congestion management operating and planning protocols with out any changes Clearly our response FERC will include our proposed cha nges to the documents Highlights from her report below She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input r egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC Her opinion is that the Grid Entergy GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s ponsored Model transco in RTO LMPfinancial rights congestion managemen t is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No based on a best practices analysis of other RTOs and C ommission precedent This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model However she does provide the Commission information on Southern et als proposal independent system administratorlike National Gridtype in her report even though she has concerns that the Southern etal model i s not Order No compliant The Southern etal model has a hybrid phy sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a nd LMP in real time with penalties and significant control area responsib ilities The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below Grid Governance RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement the Independent Market Administrator IMA The IMA was a dded to facilitate public power participation worried that transmission ow ner on top even if divested from generation would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution The IMA would a dminister the markets exercise operational authority over the transmission system administer one OASIS with one process for interconnection and tra nsmission requests and assume the Security Coordinator function She str ongly encourages this split Good stakeholder advisory Committee provides majority and minority views and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets Allows for Independent Transmission Companies Entergy wants to be one wi th RTO oversight Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation such as switching transmission elements pur suant to operating procedures approved by the RTOIMA Recognizes that con solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures Protocols should be subject to further discussion RTOtransco has primary responsibility for tariff administration including rate changes and tariff filings All load under the rates terms and conditions of OATT GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders and thus retains their rights should they win on appeal transmission pricing zones initially Entergy Southern GridSouth and G ridFlorida Allows for participant funded direct assigned and merchant t ransmission Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal for existin g facilities and regional charge for new facilities other than those abo ve There will be one through and out rate plus a Grid Management Char ge for RTO operation Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT Financial RightsLMP includes real time spot market is clearly the pref erred model and represents best practices model from PJM and SPP many details need to be worked out in continued discussions Model allows parti es to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges FCH Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation auction and nondiscriminatory release The Grid model includes a balancing resource requirement that we will provide comments against Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported control area operators required to provide before such market establishment RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC RTOtransco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process Numerous comments from marketers IPPs on reduction of control area functio ns all of our comments from last weeks response are included Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners Many a re still concerned that FERC had not conducted a costbenefit analysis an d had concerns over the costs She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the economies of s cale and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure In any event FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions concerned about cost shiftin g mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo wed Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t ransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a ssets concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re tail open access concerns with Cal Judge encourages the Commission to u tilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant jump sta rt it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Jud ge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions Furthermore the in itial results after days show the majority of participants favoring a b est practices PJMSPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with L MP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent b oard structure that accommodates a forprofit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process The Commission should consider

effort PGE is included in the in favor group in Howards message but both Al and I have since let him know he should not include us as being in favor unless and until weve coordinated this with Enron Im relying on you to do that Time is very short Howard needs to be moving on this now if he has any shot at all of influencing the outcome While I agree the message ought to be delivered Im not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point If nothing else it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result so they cant say no one told them dn Original Message Date pm Tuesday From AL ALEXANDERSON To IXGateWIZ CC DOUGLAS NICHOLS Subject RENew Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the billion shortage to sellers Were still trying to get Enron guidance on this Possibly wed rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution Im traveling with my cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list Sorry for the mixed signals al Howard J Weg PM I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues As you know I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible and to protect the interests of all members Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee

Subject disruptive technology short and simple and confidential We produce politicalpublic affairs television programs which air in state capitols Currently we are in Pennsylvania and Ohio expanding into NJ Md and DE The disruptive technology is this the real target of the TV show is the guest not the audience Lobbyists have trouble scheduling time with politicians and regulators and when they get on the schedule lobbyists have time getting genuine intellectual focus from government decision makers We dont have trouble with either Every politician and appointee wants to be on television they always say yes When they ask us what the topics will be and we mention something like telecommunications competition or electricity deregulation they want briefing material which they actually study in order to do well on television In addition by inviting journalists and radio and television commentators as members of out panel we have the same effect on them In short Step one identify govt decision makers that our sponsors want to influence Step two invite them on the program and in doing so develop rapport with their key staff members on the relevant issues Step three send briefing materials andor give a briefing in person before the the taping Step four towards the end of a show in which the Newsmaker has largely been bragging about hisher policy agenda Step five steer the conversation to sponsor selected topics framing the issue in such a way as to make it very difficult for the guest to resist the conclusions suggested by the host Step six take the statement of support for the position we favor eg tort reform privatization deregulation tax cuts etc which by the way we almost always are able to get from the guest on the air and in addition to airing along with the airing of the rest of the show we digitize it and send it out to legislators regulators and the proper beat reporters via email making it almost impossible for the newsmaker to back off later Current sponsors Medical Society Hospital Association State System of Higher Education Manufacturers Association Cornell Corrections ATT Levels K K K per year for Pa k for Ohio one level only This is an amazingly simple elegant and direct way to influence policy makers and opinion molders and we do not have an energyoriented firms in partnership with us Enron and Newsmakers are a very good fit Ill

A Landwehr Susan M Hoatson Tom Nicolay Christ i L Steffes James D Alvarez Ray Shelk John Rodriquez Andy SubjectRE RTO Week Comments ICAP The FERC Staff report on RTO Week states that most panelists agree that so me type of long term capacity obligation is needed as long as demand is no t very price responsive in order to allow generation to recover its fixed costs and support investment The report also notes that some panelists support a recent staff proposal supporting an LSE holding foward call option s on energy YES and a capacity obligation being a transitional obligation until demand b ecome price responsive As I describe below I believe that placing the res ponsibility on the LSE should be sufficient I dont think you need a trans istional period I have cut and pasted our Executive Summary from the ICAP comments as our r esponse see below but I have a couple of questions for this group We say in our comments that a real time energy market through an R TO will give consumers the means to adjust their demand curve because they will see real time prices However if a state has a rate freeze in effec t andor if retail access is not permitted in a state how can retail load respond to the RTOs real time spot market prices The short answer would b e they wont But we need to remember that some states still are moving f orward with some type of retail access mostly for the CI customer market These are the folks who can make a difference and the ones with the most potential to benefit In the areas of no retail access it is still importa nt to have a transparent market to send the correct signals for development of transmission and generation but even without retail access and a fixed rate depending upon new technologies and innovations some larger CI cust omers may opt to build their own inhouse source of energy and sell off any excess without market signals this would not be possible We need to inc lude this response in our comments What do we think of a proposal where LSEs hold forward call options on energy as a way to achieve a capacity requirement This is the proposa l I believe we should support because it places the procurement for suffici ent resources where it belongs on the LSE The generators will still be a ble to receive a capacity payment the one they like so much now from the ISOs in PJM and NY Your thoughts are greatly appreciated Also any thoughts you have on othe r parts of the Staff report would be greatly appreciated thanks Dave Perin o for sending you comments Thanks Everyone Sarah EPMI opposes the continuation or implementation of installed capacity requi rements Four appropriately sized Regional Transmission Organizations RT Os that encompass robust competitive spot markets for energy and operati ng reserve products including demand side management products will provid e an efficient and timely solution for the construction of adequate generat ion the siting of appropriate transmission and efficient use of demand sid e management products to ensure that demand is met in real time Spot mark ets reveal the cost of procuring or not using electricity based on actua l supply and demand conditions and thus signal the need for new generatio n capacity They also ensure that consumers see the cost of procurement decisions through transparent spot market processes and adjust demand based on discovered prices These markets will keep supply and demand in balanc e in both the long and short run without the use of artificial planning cri teria Therefore there is no need to continue separate installed capacity requirements in an RTO environment The use of the spot market to establish pricing for all energy products is new to the electricity industry Regulated consumers have historically pai d utility tariffs that reflect regulatory decisions These regulated tarif fs provide little if any meaningful supplydemand price information to th e consumer so the response has been to consume even during times when the u nderlying cost of doing so has been high As a result demand curves hav e been categorized as inelastic or vertical suggesting the need for ca pacity related products to meet any unexpected price insensitive demand The creation of RTOs and the resulting spot markets they include will for the first time give consumers the means and incentive to

Tony Fisher cc Subject CMTA Energy Leg Update from Dorothy TO CMTA Energy Committee FROM Dorothy Rothrock SUBJECT Legislative Update As of this morning we have not seen language from the Senate to replace the SBX that passed out of the Assembly last week Rumors are that the elements of SBX will be broken apart into separate bills put into Assembly bills now in the Senate and sent over to the Assembly for concurrence today or tomorrow There will probably be a hearing in Senate Energy this afternoon on the issues We have been working to gain bipartisan support for direct access assuming that it will be pulled from the MOU and run as a separate bill if at all It is likely that direct access as a stand alone issue does not have the votes because of concerns about small customer opposition and a big business jail break Our only chance is a coalition of Republicans and moderate Democrats that requires the CPUC to suspend direct access letting customers currently on direct access maintain and renew their contracts and hopefully preserving the right for future direct access without fees if there is net short Given the short time we have left and that we have no leverage if the issue is separate from the SCE MOU I fear this is a long shot In the absence of legislation to overturn ABX the CPUC will probably suspend direct access later this month The proposed decision would leave open the effect to be given to contracts signed before today including renewals of such contracts to a later decision Draft proposed decision issued September not yet acted upon The other information at this time is that the Senate will propose MOU language similar to what originally went over to the assembly in SBX a cutoff for paying SCE debt of greater than kw probably kw and over and no direct access SCE has previously stated that this is insufficient to allow them to issue bonds thus no creditors could be paid and bankruptcy would follow CMTA will oppose an MOU bill that proposes a disproportionate spread of the debt without any counterbalancing value to us such as direct access Another piece of this puzzle is the Renewable Portfolio Standard SB that was attached to the SBX in order to gain some Democrat support in the Assembly SB bill got stuck in assembly UC but will come over from the Senate in another bill CMTA worked to get some improvements in this bill including a procedure that could lower the cost cap from cents and in exchange withdrew opposition We are NOT in support My guess is that this bill could pass in the Assembly and I wanted to make it better The other business groups have not yet determined their positions I will call Pam with updates to share with you in the next few days

see our website wwwpennfutureorg or call November Vol No When is Bigger Better The Acquisition of Orion by Reliant The possible acquisition of Orion Power the owner of many plants that ser ve the Pittsburgh area by Reliant Resources is the fifth major transactio n affecting Pennsylvanias generation and electric service since Rel iant Resources attempt to buy Orion Power however raises issues not see n before in other transactions Those transactions the PECO Energy and Unicom merger the GPU and First Energy merger the sale of GPUs power plants and Duquesne Light Company s swap of plants with First Energy and subsequent purchase by Orion did not increase the market power of a particular generation owner Why not All the other transactions involved companies operating in differ ent markets or companies that did not own generation or sale of power pl ants from one company to one or more companies In fact taken together the se transactions reduced consumer costs protected rate caps and decreased stranded costs They also led to important environmental improvements lik e new pollution control investments and support for renewable energy Reliant Resources however already owns generation within PJM and the pur chase of Orion would add generation to its PJM share once Duquesne joins PJM West For this reason the transaction should be carefully reviewed an d used to formulate a new policy concerning consolidation of generation as sets within a single market Specifically regulatory bodies should make increased demand response a co ndition for any transaction that increases generation consolidation as dem and response strongly mitigates market power Funds should be devoted to e nsuring that all consumers with a load of kilowatts and above are equipp ed with timeofuse meters This measure is necessary as the single bigge st regulatory mistake to date in electricity restructuring is the failure to make demand response a central part of restructuring Without it worka bly competitive markets will not develop or be sustained Apart from increasing demand response regulators and the Office of Consum er Advocate should get answers to the following questions Will Reliant Resources permit Duquesne Light Company the local distribu tion utility to offer in its service territory a competitive default serv ice CDS program modeled after the successful CDS program operating in th e PECO Energy service territory Will Reliant Resources exercise market power within local markets and sh ould particular plants be excluded from this acquisition to eliminate mark et power Will Reliant Resources commit to supporting economic demandresponse pro grams within PJM instead of voting against demand response as it has done recently Will Reliant Resources acquisition help finance installation of timeof use meters for all customers with demand more than kilowatts within the Duquesne control area What will Reliant Resources do to clean up some of the heavily polluting plants that it owns now or will acquire from Orion Reliant owns portions of Keystone and Conemaugh and Shawville power plants It would buy from Orion the Cheswick unit Keystone and Cheswick have no scrubbers installed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions while Shawville ha s been scrubbing one out of four boilers In Keystone Shawville and Cheswick respectively released tons tons and tons of SOx into Pennsylvanias air Keystone is also the biggest emitter of m ercury in the entire country and all four plants spew huge amounts of nitr ogen oxide at a rate more than double the modern standard of lbsmmb tu Thats not all all four plants produce an amazing million tons of carbon dioxide helping Pennsylvania to contribute percent of the entir e worlds humaninduced global warming gases Reliant can begin cleaning up by implementing in the Duquesne area the equ ivalent of the PECO Service Territorys CDS program which includes a Rene wable Portfolio Standard that increases annually the amount of renewable e nergy that must be supplied to customers CDS customers there are served b y New Power and Green Mountain Energy at cents per kilowatthour kWh more than three cents less than the cents per kWh PECO Energy char ged its residential customers in for coal and nuclear power Market Power Issues In addition to environmental issues market power issues must be examined Such an inquiry hinges on defining the relevant market and products Nationally total generation capacity is approximately MW with mo st of it subject to base rate regulation in the retail market Despite reg ulation at retail wholesale generation transactions are generally price d eregulated in all states whether or not the entities engaged in the tr ansactions are deregulated generation owners regulated public utilities municipal utilities or electric cooperatives and whether or not necessary market institutions required for workably competitive markets exist Orion Power has been participating in the deregulated wholesale market It owns power plants in New York Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia producing approximately MW and has another MW under constructi on Orion has done an exceptional job improving the forced outage rates especially among its New York City resources The proposed acquisition of Orion Power by Reliant Resources will form the nations second largest deregulated power generation owner controlling MW or percent of the deregulated generation market that totals MW of the countrys total capacity Reliant Resources has a small er share of the nations total generation capacity Yet these small national shares do not guarantee that Reliant Resources co uld not have market power in portions of the PJM Market Prior to this proposed acquisition Reliant Resources owned about percen t of total PJM generation or MW of generation capacity within the MW PJM market These facilities include MW of base load M W of intermediate load and MW of peaking capacity They are quite o ld and formerly owned by GPU and Sithe see table in attached document R eliant Resources is also developing another MW within PJM These numbers would indicate that regulators should focus on possible mark et power within the Duquesne Control Area of the units that Reliant Energy is purchasing from Orion The Duquesne Control area is scheduled to becom e part of PJM West in but regulators and the Office of Consumer Advo cate should ensure that no plant is strategically located within the trans mission system so that it possesses market power even after incorporation of the control area within PJM West If any plants that would give Reliant Resources market power are identified they should be removed from this a cquisition Addressing Market Power The combination of large generation owners creates concerns over market po wer that can only be identified and addressed by sound regulatory action In all three of the Northeastern ISOs there have been incidents of market power which have resulted in numerous rule changes There are several rea sons that the electric industry is sensitive to market power First is the inability to store energy In many other industries surpluses can be buil t up in low demand periods and used to fill in gaps during high demand per iods In the electric industry energy is produced and consumed virtually instantaneously Second there are barriers to entry in the electric indus try including discriminatory interconnection practices and other incumbent advantages Third historically the demand for electricity has been inela stic and creates the opportunity for inflated prices Inelastic electricit y demand is not surprising when most customers see average prices and do n ot have metering or the ability to respond to prices For these reasons concrete steps to combat market power in the electric i ndustry must be taken For starters the existing market mitigation measur es such as PJMs price cap should be examined to determine if the y are sufficient while not being burdensome as to limit new generation re sources from entering the market Secondly barriers to entry should be reduced especially for distributed generation and environmentally beneficial grid technologies like wind ener gy Lastly and most importantly demandresponse programs can and must be deve loped California has shown that energy efficiency can preserve reliabilit y and break the market power of generation owners Changing the demand for electricity is the biggest and best protection against market power A Deeply Troubling Tale Unfortunately Reliant Resources did not support PJMs Economic Demand Res ponse programs voting against them last year in the Members Committee It had company with all generation owners voting as a block with one excep tion against demand response Three cheers for the exception Edison Miss ion In the face of the mass opposition of generation owners PJM wobbled but d id not cave It changed but submitted demandresponse programs to FERC whi ch were approved for the summer of The moral of this tale is that the public interest needs regulators the P JM Board and other interested parties to further demandresponse initiati ves because generation owners will likely be roadblocks In particular r ealtime metering residential air conditioning and heating programs and wholesale markets all need to be developed It is time for strong action on these points Regulators must begin by req uiring Reliant Resources to finance the installation of timeofuse meters for all customers with demand of kW or more within the Duquesne contro l area This is especially important as the transition there may be comple ted by Our events calendar is full at PennFuture Our Global Warming Conference i s coming up on November in Camp Hill and our

to respond although it is not clear to me that a response is necessary to these emails Im a little unclear about the positions of the people in the emails I think our best response to Ron Cinergy is that MISO does not serve load so MISO is not accountable to IURC Do we agree that MISO is considered an Indiana utility If we agree with that statement are they subject to any IURC oversight Even if they are I dont think it should be because of the bundled retail load issue but rather because IURC has the right to regulate all public utilities perhaps for safety reasons within its state But if we agree that IURC does have some authority over MISO as an Indiana Public Utility then we may need to revise the statement below I did not go into the issue of whether there will be any bundled retail load in Indiana once MISO is operating In a prior order FERC says that all transmission must be under the MISO tariff If this is the case one could argue that the service is no longer bundled but I dont think we want to get into that argument with these guys Here is some language that I put together What does everyone else think The MISO is a FERC jurisdictional entity that will provide interstate transmission service throughout its region MISO will not serve retail load nor will it operate the distribution systems that move power to retail customers Therefore we do not believe that MISO is or should be accountable to the IURC Responsibility for serving retail customers will remain with the individual entities who are currently responsible for serving those customers They will contract for transmission service with the MISO and will have the obligation to serve their retail customers It will be these load serving entities who are accountable to the IURC not MISO Original

FERC approval In other words come December or January or January we could have Indiana utilities still being operated in accordance with their own Open Access Tariffs just as they are today Do you agree or disagree with that proposition If my proposition is correct then the issue becomes whether the proposed transfer of operational control to MISO meets the requirements of Section ie a public interest standard As you know I think that MISO has done a creditable although by no means perfect job in considering and balancing the interests of affected parties and has a meaningful stakeholder input process So I think that it would be a mistake for Indiana parties to try and load up the IURC approval process with a lot of partyspecific Christmas tree ornaments By the same token I am quite concerned about a rubber stamp approach to IURC review I think that the statelevel parties and the IURC have a significant interest in the transfer being for a term of years which does not exceed five I think the State should retain the ability to withdraw its approval of the transfer of operational control and investigate the effects of MISO operation on Indiana retail load I think that the statelevel parties and the IURC have an interest in defining the goals or standards for MISO performance during the initial transfer period based on which an extension of the authorization would subsequently be granted or denied I think that the statelevel parties and the IURC have an interest in the MISO acknowledging that it is an Indiana utility with SOME degree of accountability re at least bundled retail load to the Indiana Commission and the Indiana parties And I do not see those interests being recognized or accommodated very much if at all in your settlement proposal Do you disagree If so tell me how you see those interests addressed in your proposal I want to hear what others say but as matters stand my inclination would be to pursue these issues in the hearing brief

Peter Vint Robert Gresch Beth Goodman and their groups on all new market issues We worked as a team and no matter at what point of the new market spectrum problems came up we all pitched in to resolve the issues Your group appears to have a more territorial approach to new market issues and in the past have rejected my offers and efforts at networking I have tried to respect that Prior to sending out the IL analysis I placed a call to your group indicating that I was working on that analysis and had some questions I did not get a call back Taking the time to return that call may have saved us

to talk about in a general context is how we are going to address the Enron swipes in these types of forums I imagine they are going to continue for many months to come and my initial thought is to make sure that we have Enron people at as many forums and conferences as there are out there and not shy away from public visibility Im not sure how I feel about whether we should be trying to get spots on the panels and whether if we do that it should be a high level person like a Rick or a Jim A strategic discussion on this issue in the near term would be appreciated Original Message From Hoatson Tom Sent Tuesday November AM To Landwehr Susan M Hueter Barbara A Nord Sue Novosel Sarah Cc Staines Dan Robinson Marchris Connor Joe Subject NARUC Day Mondays NARUC convention consisted of three sessions opening remarks FERC RTO Policy Update and a session on attracting capital to the energy infrastructure Opening Remarks The convention opened with remarks by NARUC President William Nugent FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell PA PUC Chairman Glenn Thomas substituting for former Governor Ridge and the featured speaker Comcast Cable President Brian Roberts a Nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didnt much of anything b Brownell introduced a Georgia Commissioner named Bubba who sang several patriotic songs she did not address anything relative to FERC policy or activity c Thomas spoke about the great state of PA Benjamin Franklin William Penn and Philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy d Roberts talked about the future of cable television The FERC Policy Update this panel consisted of moderator Nugent FERC Staff Dan Larcamp Southern Company Chairman Allen Franklin James Torgenson of DPL and PA Commissioner Terence Fitzpatrick a Larcamp and did not provide very much information or insite into FERC RTO policy He did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the RTOs what he didnt say was that they would be the same rules and protocols He said that they are looking at RTOs at least In the Midwest the Alliance is moving forward and MISO is getting bigger with the addition of SPP and that FERC is looking at if the Midwest RTO should be or RTOs in the Northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered I took this to mean that on governance they are going to go threethreethree from each ISO but others I talked with outside the session didnt get that time will tell and the Southeast will be slower to develop there are small but clear regional differences that are important and that it must accommodate the forprofits and the notforprofits public power b Franklin from Southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for RTOs interesting comment and there are two major issues to be considered in forming RTOs cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted He promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate He promoted the SETRANS model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south c Torgenson of DPL gave a very dry overview of the status of MISO with nothing new to report d Fitzpatrick of PA one of the Commissioners Steffes Montovano and I met with in July began by stating the PA Commission is fully supportive of the NERTO must have been our July meeting for two reasons i advantages of a bigger market and ii FERCs clear preference for PJM as the platform He mentioned the concern of commissions in other PJM states but in general there is support He then went on to stress the merits of DSM The last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an Enron perspective we have quickly become the fodder for case studies and Enron is now a verb that is more akin to a fourletter verb The panel consisted of moderator Iowa Commissioner Diane Munns Charles Cicchetti of Pacific Economic Group Jeff Miller of JP Morgan Partners Christine Uspenski of Schwab Capital Markets and Walter Rogers of Merrill Lynch Asset Management a Cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators job harder and that they must be market participants he used the term GONZO market participants He also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the RTOs no one will build transmission no reason given and that regulators need to be involved b Rogers of Merrill Lynch most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions California the downturn in the economy and ENRON c Uspenski from Schwab told the regulators Dont get Enrond That if something presented to you doesnt seem to make sense then it doesnt and they should investigate further d Miller from JP Morgan also mentioned Enron several times in the same context as the others Signed Hoatson Robinson Staines Connor

model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond and may then apply for PGE I agree that if you were to go to a bottoms up it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs nongeneration for example QFs and a second surcharge for Negative CTC overpayment Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC overpayment On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim my concern is that to understand how much the overpayment was during Oct Feb we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period Otherwise we dont know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks Jim Original Message From Comnes Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Steffes James D Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT After the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit no So a customers CTC payments should not be affected by refunds If refunds are distributed prospectively we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PGEs expected refunds divide it by total load and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Wednesday November PM To Comnes Alan Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT Alan

Thanks for the thoughts I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs I believe that you are right on Est RT CAISOM Imbalance but I need to check On the question of retroactive ratemaking it is my understanding that you are correct PGE probably wont rebill but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to collect the overpayment of Negative CTC All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than c on the for the Negative CTC Jim Original Message From Comnes Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Steffes James D Dasovich Jeff Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Jan Paul Acton Email Swain Steve Mara Susan Cc Alvarez Ray Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable HC in the formula laid out in the attachment It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs but I assume its Est RT If I am right that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price MMP for CAISO imbalance energy My comments are The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and given appeals it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price MMP as declared by FERC and the PX credit That is a reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a effect on the PX credit assuming it can be recalculated at all Specifically only some of the HC or Est RT costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders Also the PX credit is a tariffed rate I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account eg a balancing AC To my knowledge no such account exists here Finally I do not see a relationship between MMPs and block forward costs on any date and PGE andor DWRs procurement costs

incorporating some of it almost verbatim as Im working on the letter Well get a draft to you soon so that we can have this letter ready for when Congress returns I have one question regarding the SawyerBurr bill in Section there is a paragraph on negotiated rates This is basically the same paragraph that was in the draft legislation we discussed in the DeLay meetings in July and it is also in the Landrieu draft transmission legislation What is your interpretation of this negotiated rates section I cant think of a situation in which this would be beneficial to transmission users and I cant really figure out how this would even work in an RTO After talking to a couple of regulatory people all I can think is that this section is meant for the benefit of transmission owners who are thinking in an Order type system where it could be possible for individual transmission owners to negotiate a rate deal if this provision were enacted Any feedback Thanks Andrea Andrea L Spring Electric Power Supply Association phone x fax New York Ave NW th Floor Washington DC wwwepsaorg Shelk John John NRONcom PM This note follows up on our discussion at the EPSA Leg Affairs Committee meeting last week We very much appreciate EPSAs willingness to send a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on HR the SawyerBurr legislation introduced on August nd as part of a broader effort to educate committee members about the serious problems with this legislation First as we discussed while the overall transmission thrust of the bill is largely acceptable there are two major problems there are antiRTOprovoluntary RTO nuggets see below and the bill has the old or old old NERC reliability language The antiRTOprovoluntary RTO nuggets are as follows Sec transmission pricing page You will note that the bill says that the required FERC transmission pricing regulations shall provide incentives to utilities to promote voluntary RTOs without having the effect of forcing utilities to join RTOs the regulations shall limit pancaking but not during a reasonable transition period and in any event transmission rates can be based on a single utilitys costs Sec voluntary development of RTOs starting on page The bill requires FERC to approve RTOs where the participation is voluntary Of particular note is page lines which says that the form structure and operating entity of the RTO must be approved by the participating utilities At a minimum this language gives the utilities a veto over other market participants This could also be read as saying the utilities and only the transmitting utilities make these critical governance decisions without participation by others The section prohibits FERC from conditioning any order under the Federal Power Act on a utility transferring operational control of facilities to an ISO or RTO Second we agreed that some talking points are needed to include in the letter and in our lobbying A review of the rest of the bill shows that we can actually use the general thrust of the bill against the sponsors as follows below We need to let them save face by separating the protransmission system features of the bill from the antiRTO language Please let me know if EPSA wishes to write a draft for review or whether you wish us to supply one The suggested talking points are a EPSA welcomes the bills acknowledgment of the importance of improving the transmission system generally and the critical role of RTOs in particular eg sec of the bill has a central role for RTOs in siting of key transmission lines b EPSA agrees that transmission pricing is important to providing incentives to improve the transmission system c However EPSA also believes that it is inappropriate to tie FERCs hands on RTOs in the name of improving the system when reducing FERCs authority will make it harder not easier to improve the transmission system FERC tried a voluntary approach to RTOs and it has been painfully slow RTOs need to be of a size and configuration that parallels natural trading markets and power flows and this is not a federal v state issue as regions exist and would be encouraged under the bill the real question is what type of regions perhaps this latter point goes before the one on size and scope d Congress can address the transmission pricing and siting issues without the voluntary RTO language e Point out the problems with the NERC reliability language Let me know how EPSA wishes to proceed We strongly recommend that the final letter go out next week so it is received as Congress returns from the

Tapscott Ron Cc Zisman Stuart Steffes James D Subject RE Sale of our interest in Doyle to Walton County EMC Since this is a transfer of jurisdictional assets the filing required is pursuant to Section of the Federal Power Act and Part of the Commissions regulations Part lists information to be provided and it is fairly extensive In order to show that the transaction is in the public interest the Commission requires that you provide a description of each applicants business activities ownership affiliates and subsidiaries with a description of their business activities a list of wholesale power sales customers of the applicants and of course a description of the transaction We made a similar filing recently for the New Albany sale There may also have to be a Section filing made if any tariff revisions are required This is usually a pretty quick filing to prepare In the case of the New Albany sale some minor changes had to be made to the affiliate portion of the tariff sheets For the New Albany sale we used LeBoeuf Lamb as our counsel Christi is this typical or do we sometimes use Bracewell instead In any event if closing is imminent it sounds as if we need to proceed very

Message From Sullivan Lora Sent Wednesday September PM To Dernehl Ginger Cc Sullivan Lora Subject Federal Government Affairs Report September FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MEMORANDUM FOR HOUSTON Update on Legislative Issues September ENERGY ISSUES Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman DNM released his draft Chairmans Mark of electricity restructuring legislation The draft is positive for Enron on transmission issues including access jurisdiction and RTOs and reliabiilty We have concerns about provisions on transparency marketba sed rates and merger review We have said we are generally pleased while we work to amend those provisions about which we have concerns We drafted testimony for Jim Steffes to be the EPSA witness at a Hous e Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing on reliability siting and tr ansmission pricing issues the hearing was cancelled due to the tragic even ts of September TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY House Speaker Dennis Hastert RIL said that he didnt expect the House to vote on Trade Promotion Authority until next month citing a need for House Republicans to get all our ducks in a row Senate Finance Chairman Bauc us DMT has stated that he would wait until the House took action on TPA before he would introduce his measure With the House pushing the vote unt il October it lessens but doesnt eliminate the likelihood that a bill w ill be done this year Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas RCA who is taking the lead for the House Republicans has vowed to spend more time working with Democrats to c raft a bipartisan product Ways and Means Ranking Member Carl Levin DMI has not yet introduced his bill He is still meeting with Democrats and h as stated that he wants to introduce the most balanced bill he can that w ill include labor and environmental provisions The Administration continues to push hard for TPA They have made securing trade promotion authority their chief trade objective this year Presiden t Bush recently said that he wants TPA before the World Trade Organization ministerial in November BANKRUPTCY REFORM House and Senate Conferees are hoping that conflicts between the House and Senate versions of the Bankruptcy Reform bill will be worked out expeditiou sly House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner RMI who is chair of the Conference has stated that the Conference will meet formally for the f irst time next week There are two sections of the Bankruptcy Reform bill that have significant importance to Enron financial contract netting provisions which are in cluded in both the House and Senate versions and a technical correction s amendment regarding production payments which is currently included in t he House version only There are members of the House and Senate who have been appointed to the Conference which is unusually large The Conference has to deal with amendments that the Senate made to the House bill including the technical corrections amendment regarding production payments The Administration h as some problems with the bill none that pertain to our issues The progr ess is expected to be slow FY TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS MEXICO TRUCKING BAN Just prior to the adjournment for the August Recess the Senate passed the FY Transportation bill which contained provisions that called for stric t safety standards for Mexico trucks gaining unrestricted access to US ro ads Senator Phil Gramm RTX and Senator John McCain RAZ both vehemen tly oppose the restrictive language but in the end allowed a final vote on the appropriations measure They have vowed however to hold the bill up in the HouseSenate Conference until the Mexico trucking language is resolv ed note the House prohibitive language is more restrictive effectively p rohibiting Mexico trucks from ever going beyond the current mile radius they now have access to The White House has on several occasions reite rated their objection to any language in the bill that would halt or slow d own NAFTA provisions allowing crossborder transit which were to have been enacted January making the provision wellbehind schedule alread y While the Mexicos Economic Minister has stated that he would not seek sanc tions against the United States for violations of the NAFTA Mexico Preside nt Vincente Fox has stated that he would consider limiting or even prohibit ing US trucks on Mexicos roads A recent study indicated that the US s failure to execute the crossborder transit provisions of NAFTA could cos t Mexicos economy upwards of billion per year The Senate and House will now go to conference on the measure and its exp ected to be a contentious debate in Conference MINIMUM WAGE HIKE The House will likely act on a minimum wage measure following Senate action which is expected this fall House Republican leaders are insisting how ever that any increase in the minimum wage be accompanied by tax breaks fo r small businesses Additionally it is likely that the minimum wage bill will be a vehicle for other business tax credits and probusiness measures Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle DSD said that the Democratic minimum wage bill will come to the floor in the fall It is expected however tha t Senate Republicans will attempt to add several tax cuts which Democrats would oppose unless there are offsets meaning the tax measures would have to be paid for elsewhere in the budget The White House has said it favors a minimum wage increase providing it con tains flexibility provisions President Bush would be unlikely to veto a m easure absent state flexibility provisions if it contained certain tax cut components

Subject CMTA Legislative Weekly Legislative Weekly November Issue Volume A weekly publication from the California Manufacturers Technology Association detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento CMTA PARTICIPATES IN GOVERNORS ECONOMIC SUMMIT Press Release Today at Governor Davis Economic Summit at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank California the California Manufacturers Technology Association CMTA proposed three recommendations to help bring immediate relief to the states faltering economy California is in a dramatic economic decline said CMTA President Jack M Stewart Manufacturing employment is down this year and by more than jobs in September alone The states unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months peaking at its present percent Its time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later said Stewart CMTA today will introduce proposals to Implement a Sales Tax Exemption presssalestax presssalestax on Manufacturing Processing and Telecommunications Equipment Reduce Electricity Rates presselectricrates presselectricrates and Provide Customer Choice in Energy Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees pressstopfees pressstopfees and Taxes These initiatives will comprise the associations focus in the coming months and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stocktickers and cable financial networks They are the human toll of jobs that are lost mortgages that fail and families that go with less added Stewart These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the states workforce Californias manufacturing sector currently produces percent of state exports One sixth of state payroll percent higher wages than the statewide average And for every manufacturing job an additional jobs are produced These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis concluded Stewart BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS According to just released data from Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Association NVCA venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the rd quarter dropped percent over the nd quarter of this year Investment has slowed significantly this year and the rd quarter investment is percent lower than the billion high reached during the nd quarter of The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the rd quarter Venture capitalists invested billion nationally during the quarter down percent from the previous quarter and percent from the billion high of last year Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors the venture industry will persevere Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the longterm venture capital cycle Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through commented Mark Heesen NVCA President CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association CMTA and other employer organizations Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB by Senator Gloria Romero DLos Angeles The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child parent or spouse in any absence control program Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child parent or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds high temperature sore throats etc that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care However employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions When employees dont show up or show up late for work it negatively impacts production In order to mitigate this problem employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling suspension and termination After the above provision became law employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse SB would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem In addition to insuring that production schedules are met the main reason for an employers absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled andor on time Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning For example if an employees attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes no disciplinary action could be taken In other instances it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late SB would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees CMTA discussed with legislators the counterproductive nature of restricting an employers ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB and could end up eliminating the

deregulation unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians It hasnt MATTHEW C QUINN STAFF Nov Atlanta JournalAtlanta Constitution Home Page E Copyright The Atlanta Journal and Constitution Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas theres widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to million homes and businesses the goal was to drive prices down and improve service Instead heres what resulted A relentless wave of billing errors confusion and customer service complaints Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winters record cold Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills Three marketers have gone bankrupt reducing competition Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong No easy fixes are at hand No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what theyve had to go through said Paula G Rosput chief executive of AGL Resources parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers Rosput who joined the company in when deregulation was already under way now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably swimming against the tide Georgias relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit she said Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly Theres plenty of blame to go around here she said noting that never in the history of Georgia has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide Gov Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers but he has profound concerns about the impact on consumers Barnes said hes not out to scrap deregulation Thats a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in According to Atlanta Gas Light more than consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored except in certain hardship cases The PSC has allocated million to help lowincome senior citizens pay their bills and the federal government has kicked in million for lowincome families but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers As a result social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers The Sullivan Center a southwest Atlanta nonprofit is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills Many of them havent paid since last winters frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut offs but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term When the moratorium expired in April more than customers were targeted for disconnection and marketers were stuck with a reported million in bad debt Since then homes and businesses have been shut off of those were reconnected after paying their bills Nancy D Coveny executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry which offers assistance to lowincome residents said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies Before deregulation it was a lot easier to straighten out problems Coveny said We would call Atlanta Gas Light We had relationships High prices Jessie Champion of southwest Atlanta said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a bill dating back months Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light and was told by the company that the computer messed up Shes been using an electric heater for her household which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son Catherine LandWaters vice presidentcustomer service at Georgia Natural Gas said Champions service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas even though she sent a check Service was restored two days later but only after she yelled and screamed and complained to the PSC I have to have gas she said I have seven children Dave Benfield a spokesman for Infinite said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection The small Floridabased marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment If people dont pay us in days they get a notice Benfield said In most cases they pay The PSC has logged more than complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing billing inaccuracies disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications People arent being treated right says PSC member Stan Wise a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out and complaints to the PSC have tapered off What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months residential prices charged by marketers remained high Last week wholesale prices shot up percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch Its not clear how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley Reeling from bad debt Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price which was not heavily promoted as an option A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was compared with an average of for six regulated utilities in nearby states Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service plus Atlanta Gas Lights distribution charges PSC member Robert Baker says AGLs charges which account for percent of typical bills may be partly to blame for high bills On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to million a year above whats authorized the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates AGL meanwhile claims its entitled to a rate increase of up to million With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers its hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas What was supposed to be Georgias gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted That touched off an array of billing problems and errors When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed many consumers already angered by the billing problems blamed deregulation and didnt pay their bills While those problems were evolving in Georgia California had its electricity implosion Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation theyd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services including electricity and telecommunications But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power said Warren Darby retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia SC When Georgias moratorium on shutoffs expired in April marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated million in bad debt Instead of building market share they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality Darby said Shell Energy an affiliate of Shell Oil Co recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas The crash program by Georgias No marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints Darby said Shell is circling the wagons Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia has not been an exciting profit picture for us but he insists his company has no plans to pull out He added however Unless things get better no company can survive this Georgia Natural Gas Services the states top marketer has been one big headache for AGL Resources its parent which recently took a million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner Its not been a good business for us said Rosput of AGL No marketer Scana Energy has reported million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year or about per month per customer after accounting for bad debt The South Carolinabased company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses The company says its in for the long term New Power Co made a late and aggressive entry into Georgias natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets Wall Street didnt like the idea The companys stock has plunged from a year ago to less than Its top financial backer Enron Corp last month wrote down about million of its investment But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that its not planning to pull out Still theres concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business The ranks of marketers has already thinned from three years ago to eight The top four control percent of the market PSC member Baker already sees an oligopoly with limited competition Consumer choice is supposed to be the hallmark of deregulation said Commissioner David Burgess Instead he said consumers have less and less Reregulation calls So far no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems Calls for reregulation are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January Already a key backer of the deregulation law has jumped ship We cant let Georgia consumers suffer for another year said state Sen Sonny Perdue of Bonaire who said he will introduce legislation to reregulate natural gas Perdue the main Senate sponsor of the deregulation law is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor He would oppose Barnes State Rep Jimmy Skipper DAmericus the main House sponsor of the law said hes concerned about gas prices but hes not sure reregulation is doable at this point Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance We believe a year from now weather permitting that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems including dilemma No If its reregulated who takes the ball says PSC Chairman Lauren Bubba McDonald Jr Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for million customers which was turned over to marketers Then theres the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a bailout to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light or even a marketer offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated Other measures could include new standards for billing customer service and meter reading more authority for the PSC including emergency power to regulate prices reducing the sales tax for gas bills and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for fixing deregulation In fact there may be no good fix Rosput said shes prepared to get to a solution but like everyone else she doesnt have an answer It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship she said and theres no safe shore or good place to land

because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative Enrons Credit Rating of BBBSP and BaaMoodys General Creditworthiness Under Section Subchapter C of the IL Admin Code as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement In IL EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of MW or more To secure this license EES was required to post bond in the sum of The bond is valid for one year and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES If the license bond is cancelled modified expires or is drawn upon EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount The EES license bond expired on June EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June and annually thereafter Registration Under SubPart B EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only nonresidential customers with maximum demand of MW or more Subpart B has additional financial qualifications To maintain certification under Subpart B EES needs to maintain at least one of the following longterm credit ratings of BBB SP Baa Moodys BBB Duff Phelps or BBB Fitch or Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall not be less than or of EES revenue for last fiscal year or Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in an amount not less than or of EESs revenue for the last fiscal year or Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES contractual failure This certification shall be covered by an unconditional guaranty bond or LC in the sum of times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next months multiplied by the average of the highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year or EES maintains a line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of or of its revenue for last fiscal year from an A rated financial insitution or EES earns points on the financial ratios pretax interest coverage funds from operations interest coverage funds from operations to total debt and total debt to total capital Enrons Credit Rating and downgrades To satisfy the Subpart B requirements EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp Given our current credit rating of BBBSP and Baa Moodys that guaranty is still valid However if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness IMPACT The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EESs ability to do business in IL Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license This will trigger contractual default for all our customers both financial and physical Please note that EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP Single Bill Option Pursuant to Section Subpart F any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option SBO must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities monies that it collects under the SBO tariff To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards EES must either Post and maintain bond in the amount of of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an A rating Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings a BBB SP Baa Moodys BBBduff Phelps BBB Fitch Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings Enrons Current Rating EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings EES is not rated However given Enron Corps current credit rating of BBB and Baa a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff Further Downgrades If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings EES will need to provide a bond or LC or forego the SBO option IMPACT EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical However there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables Instrument Fund Charges akin to stranded costs Under the Illinois tariffs EES can choose annually one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges To remit IFC charges within days of receipt of customer payment or more frequently as required or within days of utility invoicing whether or not customer has paid If EES chooses the nd option it has to provide a security deposit equal to one months estimated IFC charges for all EES customers Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage and the IFC charge per KWH If the expected IFC charge for EES customers is or more this deposit amount will be revised monthly If EES chooses the nd option remittance of bills within days of utility invoicing we will be required to provide the deposit IMPACT This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd For ComEd IFC charges nets out to zero and customers do not pay those charges EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IPs service territory and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement If EES chooses the first remittance option it will avoid the deposit requirement However this may have operational implications

mailtoIMCEANOTESPennFutureCpennfuturepennfutureEorgE NRONcom Sent Wednesday September PM To Friends of PennFuture Subject PennFutures ECubed Straight to the Source PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market September Vol No Straight to the Source Last year when PECO Energy and Unicom merged to form Exelon it was big news Importantly the merger settlement provided million to fund the development of renewable energy in Pennsylvania This year the companys wholesale trading and marketing unit Power Team presented renewable energy advocates with a big surprise signing longterm contracts to purchase the output of three new wind farms in Pennsylvania These contracts were not required as part of the merger settlement and are not included in the million earmarked for renewable energy funding Now a key force in renewable energy development in the East the Power Team contracts are essential to bringing MW of generation online from these new wind farms two of which will be operational next month The MW Mill Run wind farm is scheduled to being operation next week and the MW Somerset wind farm is scheduled to begin commercial operation the following week Mike Freeman the Power Team trader who made the burgeoning wind energy business in Pennsylvania possible gave us some insight into Exelons renewable energy commitment as well as how wind energy can be integrated into Americas power grids Whats in Power Teams renewable portfolio We have MW of hydro that is not pumped storage MW of wind MW of landfill methane MW of Municipal Solid Waste MW of wood waste and MW of scrap tires All of the wind is Greene certifiable as new resources All of the landfill methane is qualified under Greene but only MW is new generation Of the hydro all of the generation is in larger projects that have been or are eligible for certification under the lowimpact hydro standards The MSW and tire projects are not qualified under Greene but the biomass plant is Why is Power Team developing a renewable portfolio There were two principal reasons a perceived demand for renewable energy products in the wholesale marketplace and a desire to diversify our portfolio from the perspectives of fuel emissions and cost Was there internal resistance or other issues to overcome I think the initial reaction was that renewable projects would be a very minor sidelight to our overall business I dont think many people paid attention to the implications of renewable portfolio standards or external corporate mandates for renewable purchases Part of the handsoff approach was due to I believe a sense that renewable products only meant the repackaging of existing generation not changing the power system in any way Over time I think many people got comfortable with the idea that the creation of products potentially could initiate new projects that would change the power system For me thats the most important part of our participation to help encourage new development I also think that management began to get comfortable with the idea that renewable energy products could be profitable and that demand for these products could be sustaining Will this encourage new development Generators get a creditworthy counterparty that is not only willing to buy all of the energy at the generator location but is also willing to talk about additional new projects Over time other market intermediaries such as power marketers and retail suppliers may become interested in doing the same If this chain of events occurs I think we may even see renewable credits traded over the counter just like other energy products now How do renewables fit into Power Teams overall business strategy We are a growth company and are constantly in search of ways to sensibly increase our overall generating portfolio So bringing on new renewable generation into our supply mix really is part of that overall strategy More specifically we believe there is sustainable demand for renewable energy not only because of mandates such as renewable portfolio standards but also because of natural demand The average person may not think of it this way but in supporting the idea of paying a premium for renewable energy I think that people implicitly are accepting the notion that renewable energy is an essential component of how we as a country intend to manage our future energy requirements Why Wind Theres no question that the momentum for wind projects began to build as a result of the PECO restructuring and merger settlements under which PECO provided funds for new wind projects A second reason is that the forward electric markets began a steep upward climb beginning in and especially the offpeak power market beginning in and continuing into this year A third reason was the rapid increase in electric demand in the last five years and a realization that we need to develop a wideranging set of answers to meeting the demand including supplyside and demandside solutions We felt that wind generation could play a role on the supply side while meeting what seems to be a growing demand for renewable sources What are the primary financial considerations for a wind deal The first is probably the need for a longterm contract Wind generators typically want to enter into fixedprice longterm agreements to make it easier and cheaper to borrow money and to provide a stable revenue source over a long period We dont have a problem with longterm deals per se although we do want to emphasize diversity in our contracting as well We dont want to hold multiple longterm agreements and nothing else In my discussions with generators so far there has been some flexibility on contract length In fact our willingness to enter into a longterm contract is perhaps the key ingredient to getting a wind project financed and built Beyond the longterm contract the wind developers want to do business with a creditworthy company that has an investmentgrade rating Exelon Generation is rated A by SP so we are a natural counterparty for project financing Right now there are not very many long term buyers out there with the kind of creditworthiness that we have Will that always will be the case No If were right about longlasting demand I think other large companies including distribution companies will participate in the purchase of energy from these projects Weve teamed up with a retail marketer Community Energy to stimulate demand and market wind energy in ways that will move companies to buy it In the development of conventional generation it is not always necessary to enter into year agreements for a project to get built For example a developer may want to hedge off a portion of the output on a longterm basis but will be willing to sell the rest of the output for shorter periods And in some cases the financing source may be comfortable with a shorterterm agreement for the whole thing Is there a financial advantage for wind If ones view is that the future value of energy is higher than the present value a generation source with no fuel risk obviously is good to have Wind has one key advantage over other resources perpetual availability without any fuel costs or price volatility This helps mitigate the other risks that wind does present It is of course difficult to predict what will happen even in the near term But I am a believer in broad trends or cycles that are relatively easier to project outside of significant advances in technology Over a long period of time or years I think the probability of fixedprice wind energy riding out the low cycles while providing a greater amount of benefits in the high cycles is higher than the opposite I do believe that the demand for wind generation will be sustained at a moderate premium over generic electricity prices for the next to years Is it difficult to integrate wind into your portfolio With conventional generation and firm transmission paths a power marketing entity such as Power Team can bring its resources to the highest markets whether they are hourly daily monthly or longer Such transactions are supported by a complex communications network that notifies transmission providers of the timing amount and ultimate sink of expected output The contracts that we enter into on conventional generators depend to a great extent on economic structures that ensure as much as possible that the generator will fulfill our dispatch schedule as close to of the time as possible so we can avoid the punitive imbalance fees that transmission providers impose when delivered energy doesnt match scheduled energy The approach we take on wind generation must be quite different because wind plants provide intermittent output that is difficult to predict within reasonable boundaries of accuracy I think the serious wind developers know we are serious about incorporating wind energy into our portfolio Were one of the biggest physical movers of power in the country and have a significant amount of assets that must count for something in terms of our ability to more easily integrate a MW wind project into our overall mix How does intermittent generation add complexity A wind farm generates electricity when the wind blows not when you flip the switch on It takes a lot more than I expected to accommodate intermittency even for an experienced organization like ours because the transmission system and the operational rules and procedures were not developed with wind generation in mind You dont have the ability to give transmission providers realtime information for purposes of regulating the system between supply and demand In PJM where generators can offer increments of generation on a dayahead or realtime basis and receive or pay marketclearing prices depending on actual generation wind energy can be offered into the system in one of several different ways without experiencing significant imbalance penalties An obstacle and were working with PJM on this right now is that PJM as the transmission provider typically requires no shorter than minute notice when selfscheduled or mustrun generators expect to produce electricity or expect to stop producing electricity For purposes of regulating the system PJM then has the ability to tell the selfscheduled generator to go ahead and generate or to hold off until the energy is needed as a result of the realtime balance of supply and demand This will not be practical with wind generation Wed literally have to assign a trader to the task of monitoring highly suspect expected output from our wind plants and then calling PJM every hour to determine what to do In the mustrun scenario wed still have to notify PJM of expected output so PJM can regulate the system with other generators Either way wed have to predict output which is a dicey proposition Does that make wind generation unreliable Not at all Weve got excellent modeling to predict the output from wind generation over a longer period of time such as a full year Those predictions underlie our contracts But its another thing to tell the wind when to blow The wind energy industry is working on this from the perspective of improved wind forecasting and a more automated approach than what Ive described In PJM a MW system this may not seem to be a problem when there is only about MW of wind generation in the system right now but PJM wants to institute market rules that will be appropriate for a larger amount of wind generation when it arrives A certain magnitude of wind generation will cause PJM to change the way it now regulates the system The complexity cannot be underestimated and we will be part of the solution How can scheduling and other rules better accommodate intermittent resources like wind An alternative is for the transmission provider to model the output from a wind plant as negative load instead of generation Which is to say when the plant is generating electricity the system load will be reduced by the amount the plant is generating When the plant is not generating the load will increase A tradeoff of that approach is that load typically pays ancillary services expenses such as regulation and spinning reserve In this unique circumstance which of the ancillary services apply to negative load and at what level Were working with PJM on these questions Im uncertain whether a significant amount of socalled negative load will require any kind of realtime notice to the transmission provider Of course the transmission systems are operated to react to the unpredictability of load and one can view the unpredictability of wind generation in the same way Other countries and the western US transmission systems have figured out how to handle large amounts of wind generation and so can we Are you working on other approaches Another possibility is to dynamically schedule the output from a wind plant that is situated in a control area without a realtime energy market to a control area that does have such a market The output signal from the plant would be available to the transmission provider in the second control area on an automated basis The output then becomes part of available supply from moment to moment However notice requirements would not be sidestepped with this approach Will PJM resolve these problems Yes PJM is progressive and innovative and has indicated to us that they are willing to work with us to find solutions to the schedulingimbalance issue Its hard now because were breaking new ground I expect that it will be much easier for the next projects developed How big might your renewable portfolio get Will you keep signing more contracts for new projects As long as we continue to see demand for renewable energy well continue to look at projects where there are energy markets whose longterm forward economics support the purchase of energy Id like to aggregate a significant amount of wind generation in a single market such as PJM to be able to provide PJM with a more diversified supply curve with multiple projects it may be possible to smooth the output We need to do business with companies that have the financing and the organizational will to get these projects completed We are looking to form relationships with companies that we can build on If we execute a contract successfully wed like to apply the same concepts to additional projects with the same company Examples of that are Atlantic Renewable Energy Corp and National Wind Power What are some key developments to make the industry grow faster We need technological efficiencies to drive down the cost of the equipment standardized approaches to the transmission of wind generation financial innovations to allow more risksharing and hybrid approaches such as wind and energy storage Perhaps most importantly we need consumers to buy the wind energy Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other

speak with Ashley He indicated that NG has no specific inclina tion to avoid LMP in the realtime He did not however confirm that NG w as indifferent I am very concerned with the implication that Mike highlights in his p oint NG may simply have misstated its intentions But clearly this po sition makes it difficult for NG to join MISO under Appendix I they would be giving up too much I agree that what NG is really saying is a forprofit RTO with ownersh ip of some but not necessarily all transmission plant in its footprint Lets try and coordinate our discussions with Paul Dawson in the Londo n office to gather his thoughts on NG in the UK market Luiz Can you please develop some questions talking points based on the attached comments that we can transmit to Ashley Brown prior to the meetin g Thanks Original Message From Roan Michael SentMonday November PM ToSteffes James D Nicolay Christi L Maurer Luiz Stroup Kerry SubjectRE Alliance Just been through the paper and have the following thoughts or concerns dep ending on your viewpoint The model is inconsistent with the approach taken by FERC NG propose that every transco sets its own rates runs its own OASIS and manages cong estionhow can this ensure seamless practices within each RTO footprin t I suggest the opposite will occur that is balkanization For example Transcos can join MISO under Appendix I and a number are proposing to do so Based on NGs proposed split of functions each transco could join MI SO with its own tx rates OASIS platform and congestion protocol regardless of whether they are consistent Under this scenario transmission rates an d markets would remain balkanized and vary depending on transmission compan y geographic reach similar to today NG state that the benefit of a for profit entity is that it can and w ill manage risk commercially i agree However NG miss the point hereI f an RTOISO is a non profit organisation it will only provide services su ch as tariff admin OASIS and congestion management such an RTO will not own tx assetsthe tx companies that it provides services on behalf of w ill continue to do so In providing these services the RTOISO only mana ges risk associated with non provision of service not the underlying trans mission delivery risk The transmission companies for whom the RTO provid es services will continue to be for profit entities and will continue to manage risks commercially RTO benefits result primarily from aggregation of services not from more appropriate commercial risk managementthere is nothing to stop tx owners from managing risk more effectively regardless of proposed RTO structure For example NG as a transco Translink or Cine rgy transmission could propose liquidated damage clauses for overselling fi rm transmission under the non profit RTO structure Likewise NG as transco and RTO could make the same proposal Commercial form is a second order issue NG should have concentrated on supporting FERC policy RTOs rather than stating one parties view on separation of RTO functions between profit non profit entities FERC policy suggests that the key structural issues are increasing market size regional markets and third party access l evel playing field This was the basis for the CGM proposal that came ou t of the SE mediation Separating CM and OATT admin from planning and sec urity coord improves third party access to real time information which in turn will facilitate market based investment decision making being investm ent in transmission generation or DSM Suggesting that transmission inve stment is necessary to resolve existing transmission constraints either sho ws ignorance or more likely the conflict that NG hasi suggest that inves tment in generation or DSM could resolve the problems just as adequately The model seems to be based on the assumption that transmission charges will continue to be based on contract path congestion managed through r edispatch I assume that NG and other transmission companies prefer thi s approach as it allows them to both maximise cash returns above appropria te regulated rates and control information that facilitates new investment retain monopoly I agree with Jim that this suggests a physical approac h to congestion management NGs concept that third parties can energy ma rkets is consistent with the ARTO approach ie allowing an APX to provid e day ahead market functions for example I would propose that a transco should not care what tx charging methodology was in place as long as it i s perceived to be reasonable by customers and receives its aggregate regula ted revenue requirement Thus CM and OATT administration are not core tran sco functions at all In summary I suggest that NG actually propose the paper to reflect a for profit RTO but they do not state this anywhere even if true they do not state anywhere that a transco should have consistent OATT and CM protocols if the assets they own are non contiguous or the transco has a number of owners I agree with Luiz that in this form it is a hard sell and does not resolve Enrons ongoing concerns regards Mike Original Message From Maurer Luiz SentTuesday November AM ToSteffes

reaction is The simple answer to your question is yes I think the proposed governa nce and organization structure can live with an LMP model I am not familia r with other MISO CM model but at least in terms of LMP my feeling is tha t those are not mutually exclusive It may be worth asking Ashley Brown National Grid and other proponents of ForProfitTranscos may have other ideas on how to manage congestions eg different reliability level produ cts by customer segment However the attached paper makes no allusion to avoid LMP and to introduce other congestion management models The paper do es not imply a physical model either Your feeling may be right but it doe s not surface from the paper per se National Grid proposal is in fact an expanded version of the Southeast Model proposed at the Mediation It reinforces the role of the Transco Com pany preempting to some extent the role of the System Admininstrator Th is was a very controversial topic in the mediation the System Adminstrator was in charge of some functions to avoid potential bias particularly fr om transmission companies who are not willingable to transfer their T asse ts National Grid will face a lot of resistance when selling this idea Your concerns on generation redispatch and long term transmission planning are surfaced in the paper by creating a concept of core vs additional fun ctions and a chinese wall if

Erin Boyd Bud Krogh Cook Gregory Hull Gerit Nabors Ottie F PMB Subject RE Draft Meeting Notes From SSGWI Market Monitoring Workin g g Group Meeting After looking at the latest version I have two observations to make given the earlier emails Concerning the state role this will be defined within the framework of the current FERC process to address just this issue For our purposes I am not sure that the wording really state how openended this issue is for the RTOMMUs or Westwide Monitor until some FederalState ground rules are in place I think we just need to state our flexibility and openness to work with the states in areas where interests converge given the concerns Dave Perrino raised As for the use of the term audit I too am uncomfortable with its use I believe that a more appropriate description of the role of the MMU in evaluation of the RTOs is to describe the role as one of evaluating the effectiveness of RTO rules operations or behavior in promoting the development of electricity markets In other words does the RTO ensure fair and open access to the transmission system Does it promote a robust and transparent market for transmission Does the operation of the RTO promote robust and transparent energy markets by decreasing barriers to entry removing geographic and temporal constraints and arbitrage opportunities and barriers related to resource allocation transmission vs generation additions or demand side responses I guess what I just described is something other then an audit whos meaning is somewhat more legalistic fiduciary or governance in nature

Monitoring Working Group Meeting Steve Kristi Steve thanks very much for circulating a draft summary of last weeks meeting Also I appreciate Kristis clarification in her email below From Dynegys perspective we would oppose the MMU having police and enforcement power The MMU should monitor the market and RTO according to carefully articulated criteria Enforcement should be by those with the appropriate authority states FERC SEC etc Unfortunately I was not on the call for the discussion of the role of the States but I would appreciate further discussion in this area Also was there any discussion of a Market Monitoring Committee The idea would be to establish a Market Monitoring Committee consisting of representation by stakeholders from each Cooperating RTO The Committee would interface with the independent market monitor provide input on appropriate data collection and screens evaluate the need for ruletariff changes and review and provide comments on periodic reports The Committee would have no authority to impose fines penalties etc Last week during our meeting I referred to the MISO independent market monitor model The FERC Order Providing Guidance on Continued Processing of RTO Filings issued Nov points to the Midwest ISO Alliance and Southwest Power Pool model as a single regional market monitoring unit The ideas in this proposal perhaps will be useful to

Yeung Charles Yoho Lisa SubjectGovernment Affairs Organization Announcement With the announcement of Enrons acquisition by Dynegy behind us and with the initial severance process completed it seemed an appropriate time to e ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future Before I turn to the organizational changes I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t he company as a result of the initial severance youll know who they are b y their absence on the organizational chart Leading and being a part of t his group has been a privilegeI am thankful for every day that I have had that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re sponsibility This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat ed group of professionals and support staff and who to a person are also very decent and good people To say goodbye to some of our colleagues is not easy I want to on behalf of all of us thank them for their hard wor k their integrity their decency and the good times and laughter that we shared I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special Thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done As to the organizational structure it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization with a mix of groups organized along fun ctional and regional lines particularly within the US has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times The nee d to rationalize the organizational structure in order to consolidate all US energy functions is a strong need from my perspective As a result Jim Steffes will lead the US Energy group along with Sue Nord who will j ointly report to Jim and myself Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h elp Jim shoulder a significant burden Also reporting to Jim will be a lea dership group for US Energy that will be as follows Wholesale Electrici ty will be led by Christi Nicolay Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will be led by Harry Kingerski Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner La st but not least Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara who will continue to focus o n California energy issues will report to Jim Sue Mara will also be part of the Wholesale electricity team Steve Montovano who will continue to report to me will lead a commercial development effort along with Dan Allegretti With the elimination of the regional groups I also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our politicalleg islative needs across the US Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w ill address that need and that will focus on state political support Paul will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev elopment efforts across the US Much of the rest of the group remains the same Linda Robertson will conti nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel who reports to Linda taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC Amr Ibrahi m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function Maggy Huson will take over su pport of the nonenergy business units which are as follows Global Market s Industrial Markets Networks and Broadband Rob Hemstock will continue to lead the support of Enron Canada Paul Dawson who heads up government affairs for Europe Sergio Assad who heads up government affairs for Sout h America and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther who head up our Asian efforts will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company That Comm ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock Maggy Huson Amr Ibrahim Paul Kaufman Harry Kingerski Leslie Lawner Steve Montovano Christi Nicolay Sue Nord Sarah Novosel Linda Robertson Jim Steffes and myself We will also con tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson Harry King erski Sue Nord Linda Robertson Jim Steffes myself Finally I am form ing a DynegyEnron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of Jose Bestard Paul Dawson Paul Kaufman Sue Nord Sarah Novosel and myself No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf ect or permanent I believe these changes will make us better and more pre pared for the future However we must be prepared to further adjust as th e future unfolds for the company One final note I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company We are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr oup fundamentally altered but we must resolve to do our best for each othe r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges f or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy reflects the excelle nce and integrity that has characterized our group Personally I will do all I can for as long as I can to steer the group through this to the ver y best place possible Your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated Hang in there and thanks

From Twiggs Thane Sent Monday October PM To Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean Subject RE FERC Looking at ERCOT The conventional wisdom around ERCOT is once direct assignment of the CSC congestion costs takes place then flowing across the CSC does have a cost and those who schedule across will be more judicious The second assumption is that the stakeholders chose the wrong limiting element to be the monitored constraint of the congestion charges can be attributed to that wrong element If direct assignmnet of the congestion andor designating the correct limiting element are not feasible and ERCOT continues to see very large congestion it will move to an LMP model John Meyer Shmuel Oren and most parties would agree with that

Sarah Shapiro Richard Cc Robertson Linda Ryall Jean Subject RE FERC Looking at ERCOT Here are a couple of clarifying points The congestion charges that have been incurred are million or million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is MM based upong the ERCOT protocols The actual cost to redispach and clear congestion as of Sept was MM Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation When the MM trigger was hit August ERCOT has month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion rather a direct assignment of the charge The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit It would be difficult to know if Pat Wood will try to push the ERCOT congestion management model as the model of choice The staff and Brett Pearman have been in favor of a movement to an LMP model as a fall back position initially but have been more concerned with retail acess as of late rather than the ERCOT congestion Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Sun PM To Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Shapiro Richard Twiggs Thane Cc Robertson Linda Subject RE FERC Looking at

and Steve Walton from Enron will make a presentation on transmission planning and expansion Comments will be submitted to FERC in midNovember regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs In addition the Commission stated that RTOs would not be required to begin on the Order No start date of December however all public utilities are now required to commit by December to join a FERCapproved RTO or lose their market based rate authority Standards of Conduct NOPR Several issues are raised in this proceeding including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utilitys marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal Comments are due late November ICAP Inquiry Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements whether they are needed and what impact such requirements have on the market Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed We will submit expert testimony on this issue Comments are due October California Audit and West wide Price Cap Mitigation Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible Furthermore a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California Californias summer peaking season is over but the Pacific Northwests winter peaking season will be starting soon and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest where it will be needed this winter Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints Californias Path and the Central East Interface in New York and plans to have the study completed later this year The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it In a relating proceeding the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market participants to provide more information than is currently required including at least seven additional data points per transaction This will have a significant administrative burden on Enron and will require the disclosure of commercially sensitive information Enron filed comments on October California Refund Proceeding The Commission has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the California ISO from October through June and has established a hearing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact Hearing will be held in midDecember Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding The Judge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that refunds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest We expect a Commission order shortly MidwestAlliance RTO Proceeding Various filings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTOs in the Midwest the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO Enron is advocating consistent with the Commissions recent pronouncements one single RTO in the Midwest The Commission is expected to act on these filings by the end of October Northeast RTO Proceeding Mediation to create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission Enron filed comments advocating a NE RTO based on the PJM congestion management system with a proposed start date of December PJM has proposed an implementation date of November Commission action is expected on or before October Southeast RTO Proceeding Mediation to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judges report is pending before the Commission advocating an independent transco structure for the RTO and an LMPfinancial transmission rights congestion model Enron filed comments in support and advocating a December start date Commission action is expected on or before October West wide RTO Proceedings The Commission stated that it wants the proposed Desert Star RTO and RTO West to marry up into one RTO It appears that the Commission will treat California separately The Desert Star RTO has collapsed and the transmission owners are now proposing a transco structure Commission action is expected later this year Interconnection proceeding The Commission is expected to address interconnection issues with standardized procedures and agreements likely at its meeting on October Enron has strongly advocated standardized procedures and will participate in the proceeding Market Based Rate Authorization The Commission is expected to address procedures for qualifying to sell power at market based rates which may include an assessment of localized generation in a particular region supply margin assessment The Commission is also considering adding tariff language that could make market based rates subject

at CAEM Jim Original Message From Jamie Wimberly Benjamin erizonnetENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJamieWimberlyCBenjaminEWimberlyVerizonEnetE NRONcom Sent Monday August PM To Steffes James D Cc Subject Response from Jamie Wimberly Jim Thank you for your thoughtful response Even if Enron is a hot button these days we remain big fans of yours In regard to your comments on the letter I disagree with some of the assertions First I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislation will be passed this year As you can see from the attached congressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones former VP for Consolidated Natural Gas Jimmy Hayes former Member of Congress and Nancy Etkin former head of Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition there is every indication that legislation is going to get bottled up in the Senate I agree with the assessment Moreover the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing in it of direct relevance to getting it right in regard to restructuring Without pressure I expect no federal leadership on restructuring issues While I do agree that commissions are usually a stalling tactic both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus resources ie DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring and lack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition in the energy market While you and I may have some idea of what is necessary and that is a stretch for me given the complexity of the challenges I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no idea what to do especially about the tricky jurisdictional questions involved I personally think one way to craft a new federalism on restructuring is to bribe the states into more action The federal government does this with education housing etc Why not with restructuring A carrot for those states which are moving forward linked to definite metrics of progress and openness I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERC are being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish given declining budgets and personnel I further think that this slows the whole process down Think about it telephone deregulation a growing crisis in regard to water record levels of mergers and acquisitions historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation all piled on top of each other for these folks Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter This has been corrected I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting Jamie PS Speaking of the DE Task Force have you and Bob Frank made a decision yet to participate I hope you do but I need to know as soon as possible Original Message From Steffes James D mailtoJamesD NRONcom Sent Monday August AM To Jamie Wimberly Email Cc Shelk John Subject Letter from Leadership Council to Bush WH Jamie Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter First I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages Enron is a hot button in DC and will change the proper focus In addition I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action which is imminent while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC thus supporting the forces against competition Lets not study this too much we know what to do Move away from the commission Also Im not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill Finally I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry While Enron wants markets that work well the core problem is that we havent deregulated enough not that markets arent working Also I dont know where the recommendation numbers from the BushCheney plan came from I think it was an earlier document there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the

Subject Direct Access Gary I need Enrons comments on this ASAP Forwarded by Frank FrankiniEngineeringCorporateEquityOffice on AM Les Spahnn To om cc Subject Direct Access PM All A lot of runors are swirling around There is legislation pending right now as I write this email The outcome is uncertain But here is what I know and what I have been working on for BOMA First the CPUC continues to threaten that it will suspend DA on September th including any DA contract signed since last January The PUC has threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending action on the issue by the legislature Even if the PUC were to act the legislature could override their action with a statute But I anticipate that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September th The real action is in the legislature There is a comprehensive bill SB XX the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen the Governor and the Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison Here are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it The state would securitize billion in bonds to help SCE pay its debts Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use kW or more in peak daily demand That would translate to about as in ths of a penny per kW The original proposal was to place the bailout burden only on SCE customers who use kW peak demand which would have been maybe cents per kW since the base would have been much smaller but we beat that back to the current proposal of kW The Edison surcharge would be nonbypassable That means that Edison customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or from a DA contractor If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand load which exceeds supply as calculated as follows DWR contracts IOU retained generation IOU long term contracts If this delta or headroom exists as of then per PUC regswhich are yet to be devloped the Calif Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount of headroom without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee An exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a customer for the customers proportional share of the states stranded costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR but for which there is no market If no headroom exists a customer still could go DA but pay the exit fee to do so A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to to continue without penalty It looks like contracts signed between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty but that date is not definite Contracts signed between June and August th would also be permitted but may have to pay some sort of retroactive exit fee on a sliding scale depending on the date they were signed All DA contracts after August th would be subject to the schedule described in above In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers and exit fees for DA customers when no headroom exists there will be another surcharge for all nonmunicipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since January th That surcharge would be to payoff billiion in state revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR bought since January Where does BOMA and the rest of the business community stand on these issues BOMA has been OK with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market power While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR long term contracts we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for them and wants to be held harmless for their costs BOMA and other business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without exit fees BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any surplus electricity revenues after the first million to ratepayers based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate payments This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on customers who have experienced rate increases greater than in the last few months Finally BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison But the Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone he can see including all business groups to help get it enacted In that light BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers residential as well as business pay the debt The legislature however did not want to pass this cost on to residential customers so then it became a fight over where the consumer threshold would be As stated above we have suceeded in getting it as low as kW peak demand NOTE There are those that feel it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to get the state out of the energy business You can decide for yourselves It should also be noted that the Edison bond and DWR surcharges may all be covered in the existing rates you are now paying That is to say that there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since the market price for power has come down substantially But this remains to be seen There is more to this package and moer to come in terms of changes The committee is going back in at this evening and

dont get it right the hope is that the FERC can do that without too much legislative guidance which of course would be wrong Not sure that setting up a new federalism on this will ever work not enough to states to get them to overcome the political power of the utilities Jim Original Message From Jamie Wimberly Benjamin erizonnetENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESJamieWimberlyCBenjaminEWimberlyVerizonEnetE NRONcom Sent Monday August PM To Steffes James D Cc Subject Response from Jamie Wimberly Jim Thank you for your thoughtful response Even if Enron is a hot button these days we remain big fans of yours In regard to your comments on the letter I disagree with some of the assertions First I am fairly confident that no major piece of energy legislation will be passed this year As you can see from the attached congressional update for the DE Task Force prepared by Bev Jones former VP for Consolidated Natural Gas Jimmy Hayes former Member of Congress and Nancy Etkin former head of Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition there is every indication that legislation is going to get bottled up in the Senate I agree with the assessment Moreover the legislation that is being considered has almost nothing in it of direct relevance to getting it right in regard to restructuring Without pressure I expect no federal leadership on restructuring issues While I do agree that commissions are usually a stalling tactic both Ken and I are dismayed at the lack of focus resources ie DOE has devoted almost nothing of any sort to restructuring and lack of qualified personnel directed at promoting more competition in the energy market While you and I may have some idea of what is necessary and that is a stretch for me given the complexity of the challenges I can safely say the vast majority of folks have no idea what to do especially about the tricky jurisdictional questions involved I personally think one way to craft a new federalism on restructuring is to bribe the states into more action The federal government does this with education housing etc Why not with restructuring A carrot for those states which are moving forward linked to definite metrics of progress and openness I also strongly believed that state PUCS and federal agencies like FERC are being pushed to the limit about what they can accomplish given declining budgets and personnel I further think that this slows the whole process down Think about it telephone deregulation a growing crisis in regard to water record levels of mergers and acquisitions historic changes in regard to natural gas and electric regulation all piled on top of each other for these folks Good catch on the numbering of the recommendations cited in the letter This has been corrected I look forward to seeing you in September at the Board meeting Jamie PS Speaking of the DE Task Force have you and Bob Frank made a decision yet to participate I hope you do but I need to know as soon as possible Original Message From Steffes James D mailtoJamesD NRONcom Sent Monday August AM To Jamie Wimberly Email Cc Shelk John Subject Letter from Leadership Council to Bush WH Jamie Thank you for keeping me in the loop on your activities While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter First I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages Enron is a hot button in DC and will change the proper focus In addition I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action which is imminent while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC thus supporting the forces against competition Lets not study this too much we know what to do Move away from the commission Also Im not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill Finally I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry While Enron wants markets that work well the core problem is that we havent deregulated enough not that markets arent working Also I dont know where the recommendation numbers from the BushCheney plan came from I think it was an earlier document there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have If you want to talk please let me know Thanks Jim This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may

The Million Rip Off Running back Ricky Walters a native of Harrisburg once responded to a que stion about why he did not lay his body on the line to catch a ball over th e middle by saying For who For what Residential and business customers in the Duquesne Light service territory should also cry For who For wha t to the news that starting in January when Duquesne Light joins PJ M West they will be charged million per year to meet PJM Wests new ca pacity requirement called ACAP the close relative of the rogue PJM ICAP ru le Actually in this instance for who is clear PJM and Orion are the parti es for whom customers will pony up million or per year for a kWh monthly customer Orion is charging per MWday for capacity the equivalent of cents per kWh The cash goes into Orions pocket and is a windfall for a product that typically has a marginal cost of zero see the affidavit of Professor Peter Cramton filed with FERC on behalf of the New England Independent System Operator who properly concluded that ICAP s hould be scrapped But the windfall to Orion is delivered courtesy of the PJM Independent System Operator that stubbornly clings to its failed ICAP m arket and wont replace it with forward operating reserve markets and requ irements The real mystery is for what will customers be paying million Has a nyone shown that Duquesnes reliability record has been unsatisfactory Has PJM demonstrated that the million would reduce Duquesnes loss of load probability There are no good answers to those questions ICAPACAP remai n the biggest consumer ripoff in the wholesale market Its past time for FERC public utility commissions and especially the offices of consumer ad vocate to insist on their abolition and replacement A few things must be remembered about ICAP Along with the huge ECAR region an area twice the size of PJM the Duquesn e Light Control Area prior to January had no ACAP or ICAP rules And y et for the last years the lights have stayed on in Pittsburgh as well as or better than in PJM Even when PJM had rolling blackouts on January the Duquesne control area continued to provide reliable power So what will the million buy consumers More reliability No ACAP won t increase the Duquesne control areas historic level of reliability And e ven if it would why is it necessary Reliability in the Duquesne control a rea has been excellent In fact Duquesne and the rest of the ECAR area ens ure reliability through different equally effective but lowercost reliabi lity rules The Current ECAR Model The ECAR model could be summarized by the phrase pay only for what you nee d The current reliability mechanism is met through purchasing percent o perating reserves These are made up of Load and Frequency Regulating Spin ning Reserves percent and Contingency Reserves of percent divided in to percent of contingency Spinning Reserves and percent of Continge ncy Supplemental Reserves These reserves margins have served western Penns ylvanians well resulting in reliable service equal to and in some cases exceeding PJM Reserve payments compensate only those units that are not operating at the time but have the capability of generating in less than minutes The cos t for these reserves is not easily calculated due to lack of a transparent market Yet they appear to be approximately less than MWday during onp eak periods and often less than MWday This would result in costs of le ss than MWday based on the Allegheny Power peak load The cost for a typical residential customer would be cents per kWh The Current PJM Model The PJM model could similarly be described as pay for everything and stil l pay extra for what you need Generators receive three payments the rese rve payments mentioned above a capacity payment and an energy payment PJ M like ECAR has a need for operating reserves and purchases these in orde r to maintain reliability Additionally the PJM model provides an Unforced Capacity payment to all generators based on their historical performance Generators receive this payment whether or not they are able to operate on a particular day or are already being compensated for providing electricity PJM currently compensates generators based on a percent reserve margin The overall cost of ICAP has varied considerably over the three years of competition The average since has been MWday This results in overall costs of over billion per year Residential customers have ex perienced ICAP costs ranging from about to cents per kWh Moreover on top of ICAP a PJM customer must purchase additional spinning reserves costing approximately the same as the reserves in ECAR Ending the Ripoff PJM should move to a reservebased reliability methodology similar to ECAR An Operating Reservebased methodology used in tandem with PJMs competiti ve electricity market will furnish the same level of reliability but at gre atly reduced prices This methodology should pay for those products that ar e really needed excess reserves to be used during peak demand periods A strong forward energy and operating reserve market can send the right price signals to build new generation a fact that is readily apparent as we lo ok to the Midwest where thousands of megawatts of new generation have been built in response to clear price signals over the past few years All this tells us that ICAP has its selfinterested defenders but no justif ication

James D Sent Friday October PM To Ruffer Mary lynne Subject FW CA question on PX Credit Mary Lynne Do you need anything on this Jim Original Message From Swain Steve Sent Friday October PM To Dasovich Jeff Mara Susan Steffes James D Subject RE CA question Before we carry this much further let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now unless you include DWR costs which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC AA was wondering why we werent holding some reserves for this eventuality Mary Lynne and I told them we werent reserving bc we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months reCTC but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess bc no one can agree on what PX credit market price is now that there is no PX Besides though SCE and PGE are arguing for different methods the socalled topdown and bottomup in the end the result will be about the same CTC especially now that PGE has supposedly stopped adjusting the PX credit to recover past undercollections And of course the DWR contracts muddy the waters since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation Bottom line we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run In light of all this we thought we might further quell AAs skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit we were now simply arguing that DA should pay TD only and that CTC should become a relic of the past I think by now it may be a dead issue I believe AA has accepted our arguments wo this extra bit of persuasion else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne Thanks for all the background and input from everyone and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Friday October AM To Mara Susan Steffes James D Swain Steve Subject RE CA question Recognizing that it was Sues idea though Im not sure Sue if youre referring to the DJ index or the bottomsup approach isnt it also true that Harry submitted

Dasovich Jeff Steffes James D Swain Steve Subject RE CA question All I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a RAP case three years ago The case is long closed and our suggestion was not

Dasovich Jeff Sent Thursday October AM To Steffes James D Swain Steve Mara Susan Subject RE CA question We did recommend using the DJ index But subsequent to that I believe we filed as part of the ARM coalition recommending a bottomsup approach Is that right Sue However I dont think its accurate to say that we withdrew the DJ index recommendation Both our original DJ recommendation and the bottoms up recommendation are still sitting at the PUC I think thats how things currently stand Best Jeff Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Thursday October AM To Dasovich Jeff Subject FW CA question FYI Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Thursday October AM To Mara Susan Swain Steve Subject FW CA question Steve We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ

SentTuesday October AM ToYeung Charles Cc Steffes James D Inger soll Richard SubjectRe Stakeholder Committee Notes To add to Charles memo The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders c ommittee That was very positive The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m ake the required transition If not alternatives would be pursued example EISB Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations should be taken as a package as a necessary first step These include Committee Representation The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent ation and voting to reflect the Task Forces attached Initial Sectors and Criteria Model This Model is based on the Task Forces preference for rep resentation by sector and incorporates the Task Forces general recognit ion that an RTO sector should be included The Task Force recognizes that s ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th e criteria for belonging but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately Assumi ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode l including the new weighted voting procedures the Task Force recommends that two ISORTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f or ISOsRTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen ted Committee Participation and Voting The Task Force recommends open part icipation in each sector subject to certain criteria and qualifications T he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure s used in several Regions ERCOT and MAAC and has incorporated features o f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures Specifically the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac h sector similar to what is done in MAAC Due Process The new Organization Standards Process which will be pres ented to the Board in October addresses most due process issues and concer ns The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately OneStop Shop The Task Force favors having a single organization for d eveloping Reliability Standards Market Interface Practices and Commercial Practices The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven t itself to become this organization and should take definitive steps in t hat direction at its October Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings Funding The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils The Fun ding Task Group recommendations adopted by the Board in February sho uld be pursued MIC Role in Standards Approval The Task Force recommends as an immedi ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce ss and to provide a bridge until the new Organization Standards process is implemented requiring the MIC to vote on all newproposed NERC Operatin g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board includin g consideration of any minority positions Lots of

some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco uver this Monday The customers met for almost hours before the start of the SHC meeting Reps from Enron Mirant Dynegy DENA APPA and ELCON were present All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the customer side This may mean putting aside some internal positions Cust omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o rganization for both reliability and commercial issues The Goulding Task F orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action Agenda Item Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues To ensure unity in appearance customers agreed to maintain discussions in front of the Independents at a higher policy level Many details are need ed to get individual entities on board however such details should not i mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles i eonestopshop balance of membership etc Therefore all agreed to kee p details out of the discussion iefunding seats charter etc The actual SHC discussion was constructive and persons articulated the nee d for a package deal to the room The debate brough the expected concerns o f the transmission providers to the surface TVA Terry Boston was most v ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side Dominion Resources G lenn Ross supported the customers position PJM Phil Harris was also su pportive Agenda Item Independence of Security Coordinators Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC does not have the authourity to require corporate independence Suggestions made to perform better and more audits Dave Penn brought up the memo fro m Roy Thilly Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu tion Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c ompetitive market structure FRCC Wiley made arguments that the NERC sho uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples Should deal directly and specifically with the problem A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci fic actions to safeguard independent judgement audits The vote was There were strong comments that this vote was not inte nded to be an industry representative vote only to show how split the indu stry is over this issue The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting reconvened The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following Establish a goalvision to become the one stop shop for development of wholesale electric industry standards Add words that we need to go forward from where we are Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in new Board agenda item Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an d US government entities Facilitate jointly with interested trade associations federal state and provincial regulators and other stakeholder organizations an open a nd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus try standards and practices an on a course

points We had heard from a friend of Carins in the Burr office that Burr andor the staff did not have favorable view of Enron I checked with the head of the Duke office a personal friend of mine who said the staffer has friends who work for Southern However at the meeting the staffer said that Burrs office had had difficulties with prior Enron lobbyists no longer with the company and that they looked forward to a fresh start Burrs main interest is transmission legislation that provides incentives for more investment so Wall Street will look favorably on transmission His main interest is in the incentive pricing section He said the bill was put in as they left so could stake out an opening position before Barton releases a draft in September This confirms Pats observation that Burr likes to be a player Staff said Burr has done interviews in which he said that a handful of RTOs are inevitable and desirable the question is how to get there To date he has been most influenced by the NC PUC Commissioner Ervin son or grandson of the late Senator is a family friend of the Burr staffer The PUC says that the FERC RTO plans for the SE would force NC to act on retail competition before which it is not in a position to do We need to respond to this argument Burr staff acknowledged that the final subcommitteeapproved bill if there is one would move far in the direction of the FERC plan He said that the draft to be sent out from committee staff next week will be a staff draft and that it may not even address the tough issues like RTOs leaving those decisions to Members I will check with Andy Black who told me a few weeks ago that it would either affirm FERCs authority or make RTOs mandatory Burr would be very interested in meeting with Ken Lay per the request letter we had faxed earlier yesterday Pickering is important for the added reason that he is the primary House sponsor of PUHCA repeal His staff confirmed many of the details about process in the House that we had heard elsewhere The staff draft will be out next week may not cover all issues yet There will be hearings in September That will be followed by a Barton draft that would be formally introduced reflecting additions and changes from the staff draft On PUHCA I raised our concerns about the recordkeeping provisions and gave him the clarifying language from VE included in our draft package of language we gave DOE He said he has spoken to Kelliher whose advice he respects and that Joe said the recordkeeping language needed to be clarified Joe referred him to the version in HR in the last Congress which I will check to see if that solves our problem Staffer is willing to look at our language On RTOs Pickerings office has not too much The staffer is under the impression that Entergy might actually like them in the way FERC has proposed He said Southern has raised concerns about FERCs plans with Pickerings office but the staffer gets the impression that Southern thinks they are inevitable it is all a matter of timing The disturbing thing is the staffer said something about perhaps staging the RTO process so there would be more of them of smaller scope now on a preset path to later I said this was a bad idea wasted resources to form the interm steps and likely that the final would then never happen Instead Congress needs to follow FERCs lead that make sense based on natural trading markets power flows etc I was encouraged by these meetings in terms of not encountering stiff resistance but coming away knowing we need to fully implement our aggressive campaign plans to keep the legislative process from becoming a hindrance to achieving our RTO goals

imbalance proposal by Portland General FYIto the extent that FERC accepts Portlands proposal it could be used as precedent for other utilities PGE proposed a price to clear imbalances that was rejected by the FERC FERC told PGE to look to the Exelon order for guidance After an extension the compliance filing is due Monday They have sought your reactioncomments They had a discussion with FERC staff on how to comply Staff agreed that under the Order PGE could use the average spot price excluding long term purchases of purchases and sales in the hour before to clear imbalances Schedule The PGE situation does not fit the Exelon model because PGE does not have purchases and sales in every hour apparently Exelon did FERC staff agreed the situation was different but had no suggested solutions Staff requested that PGE propose something and the FERC would react The something is A variant of the proposal recently approved for Pacific Corp PGE would use Mid C prices but use PGEs actual daily load shape Apparently Pacific Corp proposed Mid C prices but would use the load shape from California This load shape is quite different then PGEs and could lead to arbitrage opportunities against PGE by thirdparties Right now PGEs traders and outside counsel disagree on the best approach The traders want to just proposeuse the Mid C price proposal for all hours Outside counsel believes they should proposeuse the average spot price proposal when PGE does make purchases andor sales in the hour before and the Mid C proposal in other hours Do you have a preference

lose without the PPO what do we have Jim Original Message From Kingerski Harry Sent Saturday October AM To Steffes James D Subject RE ComEd wants to limit power purchase option First I think the gig may soon be over since at least one commissioner is catching on to our chirade Second since thats not a particularly helpful observation I think we ought to be very blunt that the reason we had to play the chirade is that the PPO price is far and away better than anything we can match and that it is a subsidized price because it does not explicitly recognize ancillary service imbalance and retailer costs except for the pittances we got added in the case a year ago So we can ask that the same subsidies be maintained for customers wo have chosen thusfar grandfathered in other words Going forward it seems that elimination of the PPO would be helpful to market development so its hard to argue against that So maybe we offer a trade support for elimination of PPO in exchange for

Wednesday October PM To Landwehr Susan M Hueter Barbara A Cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject ComEd wants to limit power purchase option Attached is an article that appeared in the Chicago Tribune this morning regarding Edisons presentation to yesterdays ICC Electric Policy Committee Meeting that we thought you would find to be of interest From the Chicago Tribune ComEd wants to limit power purchase option By Melita Marie Garza Tribune staff reporter October Commonwealth Edison Co on Tuesday proposed weaning its largest commercial and industrial customers from a power purchase plan that the company asserts stifles competition in the states emerging market for electricity Under the proposal the utility would differentiate between industrial customers that use less than kilowatts of electricity at any given moment and those that use more Pamela Strobel ComEds chairman told the Illinois Commerce Commission A standard Jewel or Dominicks grocery store uses about kilowatts of electricity at a given moment Strobel said Under deregulation corporate customers have three options Stay with ComEds standard regulated electricity service based on rates set in pick an alternative supplier or opt for ComEds socalled Power Purchase Option Customers who pick the last option get ComEds market rate but are allowed to choose ComEd competitors as their primary power suppliers ComEds proposal would bar its largest customers from that option which the utility says has stymied deregulation because it allows competing suppliers to merely resell the power that ComEd produced So long as the utility is providing this option real competitive markets wont work said Arlene Juracek ComEds vice president for regulatory and strategic services Some suppliers have taken the easy way out by telling their customers to sign up for the plan Terry Harvill an ICC member agreed There was an unintended problem rather than alternative suppliers coming into Illinois with diverse sources of energy essentially you have them just taking power from ComEd and reselling it to customers Harvill said Specifically ComEd proposes to limit the Power Purchase Option to nonresidential customers paying competitive transition charges effective June The transition charges cover costs incurred by the utility prior to deregulation I think its a step in the right direction but the details remain to be worked out Harvill said He noted that companies still would have the option to fall back on ComEds traditional regulated plan But Marty Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board was skeptical There are certain inherent conflicts in the way that Edison sees the world because they are a subsidiary of a much larger companyExelonwhich is in fact the largest producer and seller of electricity in this market Cohen said So you have ComEd on the one hand being the largest buyer of electricity and you have Exelon its parent company being the largest seller of electricity This proposal doesnt address that issue David I Fein Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe North LaSalle Street Suite Chicago Illinois phone fax email The information contained in this communication may be

Stacey Elliot Mary and Jesse to discuss where we stand and strateg y going forward Jennifer Overall Concerns The requirement for retailers to enter into a direct bilat eral for the power from renewable energy and schedule it into the CA grid p resents limitations and could drive up costs Its unclear if the REC is truly separate instrument from the underlying commodity The above requirement indicates that it is not This would negatively impact and even negate the main reasons to have a R EC trading program to provide flexibility and act as verification for the RPS The biomass definition is too limiting Would be difficul t to detail this amount of information on a REC Need to have language tha t distinguishes whether the REC is RPS eligible or not Utilities are given preferential treatment in proposed lan guage in that utilities can recover costs through rate base and the Departm ent of Water Resources SB only is instructed to purchase renewables o n their behalf if it is cost prohibitive for the utilities While the cost cap is positive from a retail perspective it might be out of the market from a wholesale perspective to cover the ren ewable premiums for new sources

amendments to SBX proposed by many interested parties Some passed some failed and most of them served to further confuse the c ommittee members Eventually the committee stalled on detailed propo sals

Jeff and Mike Day Richard said he is willin g to make more technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations Subsequently Hedy and I spoke to DJ Smith at Jeffs request DJ agre ed that the bill needs to use the August th date as a grandfather date for executed DA contracts but specifically asked that we Enron not speak to Richard about it He said he will have the business entities request it a s a clarifying amendment If we request it he thought Richard would be le ss likely to believe its clarifying since he believes our motives to be too selfserving Also we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct access We suggested that shall be changed to may in or der to give more leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension He didnt ne cessarily oppose the policy but his position is not to amend a bad bill unle ss you can totally rewrite it which he later attempted to do A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to push Edison into bankruptcy along with the Canadian governm ent if this bill passes There is no consensus that this measure will ever get to the Governors desk The committee will meet again tomorrow at approximately pm to vote on additional amendments and ultimately to vote on the complete bill

out in one of two ways lump sum netting ie if they owe MM and the share of the undercollection is MM then they pay the ESP MM or future reductions in PX Credit ie they pay the ESP MM and then reduce the PX going forward until the MM is paid down The numbers are illustrative only In addition he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about whether DA customers pay

Subject Crains Article October ComEd seeks rate hike for biz Second proposal spurs opposition among regulators Crains October By Steve Daniels mailto Commonwealth Edison Co is pressing for another big hike in its charges for delivering electricity to customers of rival power suppliers The Chicago utilitys Aug filing with federal regulators to nearly double transmission rates for carrying electricity over its longhaul highvoltage lines for these customers has triggered opposition from state regulators That request followed a June proposal for a increase in distribution charges for moving power through the utilitys more local lowervoltage wires Crains June That bid is subject to approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC If approved the two rate hikes together will increase transmission and distribution costs by about for business customers that leave the utility for competing power suppliers Perhaps more important the new rates would clear the way for delivery charge increases of the same magnitude on all Chicagoarea power users in three years when a freeze on ComEds rates expires Transmission and distribution rates account for to of a typical business customers total power bill so a typical bill could rise as much as with these increases Apart from the bottomline hit to businesses ComEd competitors and local government officials also warn that the hikes could stymie the nascent competitive market because they could prevent alternative suppliers from offering savings from the utilitys bundled rate AES NewEnergy Inc the largest alternative supplier in Illinois with more than customers says of its customers will see their bills increase if both proposals are approved What this means is that large numbers of customers would be down to the point where bundled utility service is cheaper or its so close that they wouldnt bother choosing an alternative provider says Philip OConnor president of AES NewEnergys Chicago office You cannot have competition being viable when your base of potential customers is so small Arlene Juracek ComEd vicepresident of regulatory and strategic services counters that few businesses actually will pay higher rates in the short term because the rise in delivery charges will be offset in many cases by a corresponding decrease in transition fees paid to the utility when customers use another supplier The Aug transmission rate proposal filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC surprised the Illinois Commerce Commission which asked FERC two weeks ago to block the rate hike The latest rate hike proposal incorporates a proposed change in ComEds account methodology in which the utility would wipe off its books more than million of accumulated depreciation of transmission assets and ask ratepayers to shoulder that investment again Unjust and unreasonable In its filing with FERC the ICC said the proposed change would result in artificially high transmission rates and an unjust and unreasonable windfall to ComEd at the expense of transmission ratepayers Theyre essentially changing the rules of the game halfway through the game says ICC Commissioner Terry Harvill ComEd responds that FERC itself in an order last year pushing utilities to combine their transmission assets into large regional networks said utilities could consider changing the accounting method ComEd believes we have an obligation to the shareholders of parent company Exelon Corp to receive compensation in accordance with what is permissible by law says Steven T Naumann ComEd vicepresident in charge of transmission services The commission will determine if this is what they meant in their order or if it is not what they meant Meanwhile the city of Chicago frustrated by ComEds resistance to sharing detailed financial data is poised to ask the ICC formally to order an outside audit of ComEds books for The state attorney generals office and the Cook County states attorneys office are joining the city in the petition which could be filed as early as Monday sources say The audit which ComEd opposes would be aimed at separating ordinary maintenance and improvement costs from the extraordinary measures ComEd took in and to beef up its distribution system after acknowledging it had neglected that infrastructure during the previous two decades The behindthescenes skirmishing spotlights how seriously local government officials are taking the regulatory proceedings While the new rates affect only those customers in the competitive market theyll be the benchmark used for the power delivery charges all other ComEd customers will pay in when the utilitys bundled rates are no longer frozen Setting the rules The company is very much aware of the fact that the rules for the future are getting set now says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment Basically the next months are going to set an awful lot of the fees for the future Mr Abolt says the audit request is one option the city has to pressure ComEd into opening its books but says it wouldnt be necessary if the company agreed to do so voluntarily A ComEd executive says the data will be made available to those who sign a blanket confidentiality agreement which intervenors in the case including the city arent likely to sign Ms Juracek of ComEd says the utility already has sifted extraordinary costs associated with its billion infrastructure upgrade out of the rate base But she allows that most of those are minimal treetrimming expenses Large amounts of overtime paid to unionized workers as well as contractor expenses are included in the rates Theres no free lunch here she says Says Mr Abolt Now its time to sort that all out So lets sort it out David I Fein Piper

Haedicke Mark E Mellencamp Lis a Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Huddleson Diann SubjectEES Billing Issues Privileged and Confidential AttorneyClient Communication This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issuesrecoupment of the PX Credit and the surcharge I would appreciate it if those of you with more firsthand information particularly Wanda and Diann correct or clarify anything Ive misstated Also please forward this to anyone e lse with an interest in this matter A Recoupment of the PX Credit also known as the Negative CTC Background The issue here relates to the fact that PGE and SCE are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers P rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March the bills would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to TD charges SCE and PGE have now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo r TD despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in PX Credits This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opini on of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be col lected as a bill credit and not in cash Mike Day our regulatory lawyer expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was i mproper and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with th e CPUC Note the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which ac crued to prior to December the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrued during that time frame and there is no dispute as to the p roper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame Further more PGE and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that had accrued as of December Action ItemsIssues a With respect to SCE Legal is evaluatin g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC The CPUC has a process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust omers while the issue is being determined by depositing the payments in an interestbearing account controlled by the CPUC while there is no equiva lent procedure in federal court one can request that the court enter an in junction against the utilities disconnecting customers While the analysi s is worth doing I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the CPUC for relief b With respect to PGE the banruptcy team is evaluat ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court Timing Late fees will begin accruing August The first discon nect notices would not be received until September Effect on other CTC issues Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effec t on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated postJanuary and pr ospectively B Surcharge Backgound Although when provisionally imposed in January the surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent when ma de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWRs purchases of power on behalf of the utilities This evolution gives rise to two bases f or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the sur charge First since the surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene ration for bundled customers only and not direct access customers direct access should not have to pay it This is the same logic that caused the C PUC to exempt direct access customers from the surcharge Secondly if legitimately applied to direct access because it is of no dir ect benefit to direct access customers it arguably can only be viewed as a tax Under EESs contracts with its customers taxes assessed at the del ivery point are borne by the customer Note SCE unlike PGE may not im pose the surcharge on direct access customers according to a filing ma de at the staff level at the CPUC so this action may relate to PGE only Action ItemsIssues a Regulatory Jim Steffes has the lead i n advising us about a challenge to the application of the surcharge to direct access customers at the CPUC It may be advisable for an industry g roup rather than Enron to make the filing b I would expect that we wou ld follow the same procedure outlined abovedepositing the payment with th e CPUCto prevent any customer from being disconnected In the interim we would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success ful c A decision will need to be made on how far we go backto July w hen the customers became DA again or to January when the surcharge was fi rst imposed Timing Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no tices Effect on other CTC issues Regulatory Jim Steffes will analyze with the appropriate people the effect if any of taking this position on other CTC issues principally how CTC should be calculated postJanuary and prospectively End

Hirstcom Subject New Report on Lessons from California MimeVersion ContentType multipartalternative boundaryALT Dear Colleague The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper The California Electricity Crisis Lessons for Other States which I wrote The paper is available on the Publications page of my website wwwEHirstcom File Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper Here is a summary of the paper California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future That future as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants Although the first two years of restructuring beginning in April seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disaster for Californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilities Part of the fallout from Californias electricity crisis is considerable concerneven oppositionin other states to restructuring the electricity industry Although a few states have decided based on the California experience not to restructure I believe that is the wrong outcome Instead the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work competition is not to blame for Californias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand and prices affect market outcomes Section of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May Section the heart of this paper offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry This section makes several points Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads Ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loads maintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support large regional markets and provide fuel to power plants Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamicpricing and voluntaryloadreduction programs ie couple retail and wholesale markets Create honest retail competition avoid standardoffer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy ancillary services and transmission congestion Monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation and vertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission Ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improve reliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options But this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern hightech society electricity is our most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment Also electricity truly is a realtime product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the longterm benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible shortterm problems that may occur They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state Finally competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and pricerisk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric Eric Hirst Consulting in ElectricIndustry Restructuring Capital Circle Oak Ridge TN phone fax Hirstcom File

wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit Consumers will enjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services and pricerisk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers Eric Eric Hirst

Opportunity for Renewable Energy PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market If you have trouble reading this email please see the document on our website wwwpennfutureorg under Pressroom Publications August Vol No Pittsburgh A Golden Opportunity For Renewable Energy The end of large stranded cost charges to consumers will usher in a golden opportunity next year for the Pittsburgh area to become the renewable energy capital of America In the Duquesne Light Service Territory in rates for some customers approached percent above the national average with residential customers paying more than cents per kilowatthour kWh Of this cents plus total about cents was for just generation And what did consumers get for this premium cents generation price well above any price including for todays percent renewable energy products seen in Pennsylvanias competitive retail market since Did they get clean and safe energy Not unless you believe that coal and uranium are renewable resources In fact the Pittsburgh area was powered by incredibly expensive nuclear plants that often were shut down more than they ran as well as some of the highly polluting coal plants that kill Pennsylvanians each year with microscopic dirt cause acid rain produce smog and contribute to global warming Both the pollution and the high costs were jammed down the throats of consumers by monopolyfriendly regulators Those who challenged the legacy of high rates and dirty power and asked the old Pennsylvania monopoly utilities about renewable energy were often lectured that renewable energy technology would cost more or was not practical Todays competitive retail market shows how wrong those lectures were Right now in Pittsburgh four competitive suppliers two are Greene certified are offering percent renewable energy products for prices ranging from cents to cents per kWh Those prices are less than the cents Duquesnes customers paid for coal and nuke generation five years ago In fact they are more than a full cent less per kWh Since renewable energy products exist in the marketplace are exponentially cleaner and cost less than Duquesnes traditional power products why have they so far not swept the marketplace Can You Say Stranded Costs or Competitive Transition Charges Customers who switch to renewable energy products pay not just the price of the product but also a regulatory stranded cost charge of up to cents per kWh On a system average basis the stranded cost charge is percent of each customers total electric bill and for residential customers it is a whopping percent of the total electric bill The stranded cost charge is paid even if you switch from Duquesne Light to another company and allows Duquesne to recover uneconomic investments in nuclear power made when it was a regulated generation monopoly Without the collection of stranded cost charges Duquesne may have gone bankrupt Yet adding the stranded cost charge to the otherwise less costly renewable energy products has the effect of increasing a customers total bill when she bought renewable energy products Thus stranded cost charges are a real barrier to renewable energy products and other competitive retail electric products But in in the Duquesne Light service territory the regulatory ball and chain of stranded cost charges will be eliminated by giving a large total rate cut of probably percent to all residential customers and by increasing the shopping credit from cents to about cents for residential customers The removal of stranded cost charges means many Pittsburgharea customers will soon be able to switch to renewable energy products and pay less or no more than what they were paying for electricity in Yes they could save even more by buying even lower cost dirty power products But the coming opportunity to power Pittsburgh with renewable energy and pay less than bills is a onceinacentury chance The Duquesne Transition The reason why Duquesne will be the first Pennsylvania utility to eliminate stranded cost charges is its successful sale of its generation plant Duquesne first swapped some generating assets with FirstEnergy and then sold all of its generating assets to Orion while contracting with Orion to continue to provide default service to Duquesnes native load customers Duquesne has provided distribution service and Orion has provided default generation service at capped rates without notable problems Without a former monopoly utility with a vested interest in keeping generation customers a far greater portion of customers switched to a competitive supplier than anywhere else in the US Competitive suppliers now serve about percent of all Duquesne customers The number of Duquesne customers served by competitive suppliers rose steadily until peaking in late at about held steady through spring and then declined to about as of July The recent decline occurred when retail offers exceeded the systems shopping credit but remained well below Duquesnes generation rate of cents Today there are four competitive suppliers offering six different products to residential customers in the Duquesne territory one of which is priced below the shopping credit and enables customers to switch and save and four of which are renewable energy products Recent sharp declines of more than percent in forward electric markets make it likely that more products will soon be able to beat the current Duquesne shopping credit of cents and of course the cent monopoly rate After the two remaining principal impediments of completing a successful transition to competition in the Duquesne Light service territory will be the full integration of its control area and wholesale market into PJM and wide deployment of demandresponse technologies Timeofuse meters and appliancecontrol devices allow customers to profit from reducing usage in summer peak hours protect reliability reduce market power and can lessen pollution The failure to achieve PJM integration and demand response could derail the benefits of stranded cost elimination and what has been so far a successful transition for the Duquesne Service territory No More Stranded Costs Stranded cost charges will likely be first removed for residential customers starting in March Up until now average system customers have had to pay cents on every dollar paid for total electric service so that Duquesne could recover its stranded costs With the end of stranded cost charges different classes of customers and different individual customers depending on their usage will receive a substantial rate cut Current Prices for Electric Service from Duquesne Light Rates in centskWh RS Rate GS GL Distribution Transmission Generation CTC portion of Gen Shopping Credit Total The portion of the bill that is the Competitive Transition Charge represents the basic rate reduction that each class will enjoy when the charges are terminated The charges are scheduled to end in March for general residential customers RS April for smaller commercial customers GS and September for larger commercial customers GL The charges end for other customer classes as late as April Residential customers using kWhmonth for example will stop paying centskWh for stranded costs reducing their total electric bill by percent Real Market Prices Generation rates will still be regulated for customers receiving default generation service under Duquesnes contract with Orion However the rates will no longer reflect the remnants of prerestructuring costofservice rates Instead they will be based imprecisely on market rates When the PUC approved the sale of Duquesnes generating plants and the transfer of the default service to Orion it approved tentative default rates at market prices as determined by the Duquesne contract with Orion The precise level of default rates remains unknown however Consumers would see total rate reductions of about percent if the default rate is set at centskWh and a total rate cut of percent if it is pegged at cents Again these default rates are well below the cent monopoly rate Although the DuquesneOrion contract set and the PUC approved the default rates the rates did not assume that Duquesne would be joining PJM West There have been some nonpublic discussions taking place between the PUC Orion and Duquesne as well as some public discussions but at this point it is unclear whether the existing rates should or will be adjusted Whatever the precise answer the PUC needs to move these proceedings to the public domain and resolve the issues expeditiously so that customers and suppliers may plan to take advantage of the new market opportunities Competitive Market Opportunities In the shopping credit will increase for customers who choose to buy generation from a competitive supplier instead of Orions default service Given reasonable assumptions about market prices and what the shopping credit may be it appears that competitive suppliers will have substantial opportunities to provide competitive service at prices below the shopping credit For example if the present residential shopping credit of centskWh is raised to centskWh as presently scheduled consumers would have a modest opportunity to save by shopping in addition to the savings that all customers including those remaining on default generation service will experience from the end of stranded cost charges If the residential shopping credit is increased to about centskWh suppliers competing on price would have a substantial opportunity to offer consumers meaningful savings by shopping One might presume that the percent of all customers already shopping in the Duquesne service territory include many of those most interested in shopping Will the opportunity to save a bit more after receiving a percent rate decrease without shopping be sufficient to entice many of the remaining customers to shop Setting the rate too low will provide a disincentive to shop by delivering even more savings to nonshopping customers who already will be getting a huge rate cut because of the end of the stranded cost charges Given that market rates are a prediction that no one has been making accurately perhaps the PUC should err on the high side to increase competitive market opportunities There is no better time for doing so than when all customers are about to receive a huge rate cut from the elimination of stranded cost charges Renewable Energys Time is Now Even moderate additional shopping based on price does not mean a noncompetitive market however Perhaps the most successful competitive suppliers will be those that offer products or services that encourage customers to switch for reasons other than price Renewable energy energy efficiency and demandside response products may well provide suppliers with the competitive edge The opportunity for renewable energy market penetration is in fact unprecedented Two new wind farms are under construction at this time in Somerset and Fayette counties bringing the total installed wind capacity in the region to about megawatts MW Two additional wind farms are under development in the same area and another is under development about miles across the state line in West Virginia potentially bringing an additional MW of wind power to serve the Pittsburgh market Depending on the precise shopping credit it is likely that wind electricity from these developments could be sold to retail customers at prices close to or not too far above the shopping credit Even if buying renewable energy is not the lowest cost option consumers would still be investing a portion of their percent rate cut in renewable generation and still receive a reduction in their electric bill from what is now paid For example a residential customer could buy one of the five renewable products presently available to consumers in the Duquesne territory and still save from cent to cents per kWh Alternatively consumers probably will be able to buy percent wind energy and still receive a total electric bill more than percent less than it is today and was in Large institutions government agencies businesses and families can without increasing their current electricity bills become renewable energy consumers With

huge surplus in generation and there shouldnt be in a competitive market Instead of focusing on something the NYPSC cant control why not work on demand responsiveness Better metering technology would certainly help Let me know when a good time would be Jim Original Message From Sullivan Kathleen Sent Thursday August AM To Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Steffes James D Montovano Steve Subject Highlights of the Recommended Decision in NYs Energy Competition Case Sarah Ive attached an article from todays Megawatt Daily regarding NYs generic energy competition case Ive also attached a summary of the RD written by Kevin Brocks our NESPA Counsel As you can see the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better Furthermore the RD states that until supplies increase and markets stabilize ratepayers must be protected In addition a PSC official is quoted as saying that it will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets and that it could be at least years before retail competition is viable Is there anything in the RTO Order or your participation thus far in the mediation process that could refute the claim that it will be or years until there is sufficient supply in NY to allow for workably competitive markets Kathleen File nespa rd highlights doc MegawattDaily New York PSC draft report sees competition in years New York regulatory staff expects comments tomorrow on a recommended decision about the future of competitive power market development in the state The recommended decision issued last month by two administrative law judges for the state Public Service Commission and a PSC official M says it will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets and that it could be at least years before retail competition is viable Two principal problems in transitioning to a competitive market are inelastic supply and demand both of which are inherent in energy markets the proposed decision issued last month says Until supply consistently exceeds demand by a certain margin the PSC must play a prominent role in the states power markets Markets characterized by largely inelastic supply and demand where demand is approaching or is equal to supply are not workably competitive and will not produce just and reasonable rates the recommended decision says Until supplies increase ratepayers should be provided some measure of protection from those markets Once supply exceeds demand sufficiently to eliminate the exercise of excessive market power the markets can become workably competitive and will likely produce just and reasonable rates The recommended decision goes on to warn Unrealistic expectations concerning the timing of market development either too long or too short can have serious consequences to the public and can in the extreme result in the worst of all possible outcomes the creation of an unregulated monopoly If competition is assumed to develop very rapidly and wholesale market prices are imposed on customers without regulatory intervention and from a market that is not workably competitive higher prices and rates that do not meet the statutory standard of just and reasonable are likely On the other hand if a long transition is assumed and significant regulatory control continues to be exercised over prices competition and its benefits could be stifled indefinitely In March the PSC initiated the proceeding to examine the states progress toward competitive markets It sought information on the difficulties that have emerged lessons learned and directions for where to go next The recommended decision says that in a competitive market utilities should play no role in providing electric or gas service But before the PSC removes a utility from the market certain preconditions must be met including a determination that the wholesale and retail markets are operating without the exercise of market power As a general matter the utilities should not be removed from any market until multiple suppliers offering a variety of products are available for the entire customer class throughout the utilitys service territory The PSC also should wait for state lawmakers or the courts to confirm its authority to take such action The recommended decision also says that robust fully competitive retail markets will develop at different times for different customer classes The PSC should encourage investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure for both electricity and gas including if necessary ordering the franchised utilities to construct any needed facilities the recommended decision says Although the PSC should restate its support for retail competition and proceed with deliberate speed in fostering market development the agency should maintain just and reasonable rates throughout the period of transition to competition We are confident that a flexible oversight process that encourages competition and allows it to develop wherever the economics can support it will protect consumers during the transition permit markets to develop freely and will serve the public interest the recommended decision says Exceptions to the proposed decision are due

Street Houston TX August Dear Steve Rick and Jim I thank you for the opportunity to work with you and your staff over the past six months I truly expanded my understanding of the scope and challenges of government affairs work since our initial meeting about a year ago In particular I appreciate more the important internal role that GA plays in supporting other units at Enron the academics tend to focus more on external actions in the public policy arena I hope that I was able to contribute to the projects that I was assigned The GA Assessment more below was particularly interesting and clearly is important for decision making about GA activities I also enjoyed assisting GAs work with EIMs steel traders Please give my thanks to your employees with whom I worked My overall assessment is that they work extremely hard and are dedicated to solving Enrons GArelated problems I thank Maureen and Ginger for taking care of the logistical details and making me feel part of the GA team I also thank Gus Earleen and the other support staff Finally I want to recognize Lisa Yoho I really enjoyed working with her and feel shes an important contributor to the GA team If you need anything from Rice please do not hesitate to contact me I hope that we continue to keep in touch Cordially Doug Schuler also sent by attachment To Steve Kean Rick Shapiro Jim Steffes From Doug Schuler Rice University Re Government Affairs Assessment Process A Brief Analysis Date August This brief analysis is based upon my assignment with Amr Ibrahim and Elizabeth Linnell to review the Accomplishments for the Period November to April reports filed by the GA professional staff It is also based upon some of the academic literature on valuation of business activities where we are interested not only on the costs side in a traditional cost center approach but also the benefits moving towards a profit center approach The importance of considering benefits is that it allows the senior GA managers to assign professional staff to areas reflecting their highest benefit considering the opportunity costs of that assignment Additionally it should allow senior GA managers to articulate more clearly GA needs eg budget requests personnel to internal constituents at Enron What I saw Data were collected from about GA professionals in the Accomplishment Report for the period November to April Each individual was asked to list his or her accomplishments the unit it served the area eg deal support origination etc its value and the methodology used Regarding the accomplishments done during the period about involved activities aimed at other Enron units such as improving communications between GAPA and ENA and EES in the New York market developing a GA website with EBS and working with EIM to design a risk management program for a client About of activities were externally oriented although in support of internal Enron customers primarily towards regulatory and legislative bodies at various levels of government Very few individuals provided data for value and methodology Probably less than of the activities were valued and the methods used varied widely For these relatively few entries GA professionals claimed a contribution of billion a figure that appears to be highly overstated My analysis would be despite the considerable efforts that went into compiling and completing these reports that senior GA management has not gained significant insights as to the value of these activities or as to an accurate methodology to calculate such values What is needed If our goal is the identity and measurement of GA activities it is crucial that these be tied to the broad strategies of Enron Otherwise we run the risk of creating a system that desires A but rewards B Thus the first step needs to be the identification of the most important broad strategies of GA The Government AffairsPR Communications report appears to be a first step it identified such strategies as business unit support create open markets and other business opportunities and regulatory and governmental risk identification and mitigation For each of these strategies some primary objectives need to be articulated For example for business unit support some objectives might be information provision timeliness and accuracy transaction support new market development and asset protection note these are just my off the cuff objectives Then we need to look a ways to assess the attainment of each of these objectives For example with information provision we might go to our users in other units of Enron to see how they would rate perhaps on a scale such things as timeliness accuracy criticality for their transaction etc We might also count the number of projects meetings memos etc that GA produced with information for other units We would do likewise for the other objectives Note that the Balanced Scorecard Approach BSA may be used to make such linkages and measures The BSA is a strategy implementation tool where activities are measured and compared to the goals of the firm BSA gives guidelines on the types of measures that are appropriate it considers such things as leading and lagging indicators training would be a leading indicator as it occurs before the activity profits on a trade would be a lagging indicator as it is the result of various activities and financial and nonfinancial measures The goallike oursis to try to take into account enough measures of the activity to make a satisfactory judgment of its merits I believe if you could create such a system you would have a much better idea of how to deploy your employees across projects how much to charge other units for GA services and when to outsource GA activities In order to do what I have suggested I think that you will have to devote more resources One possibility is to assemble a small team with members from GA and one or two operating units eg a director from EES who has some GA interaction to create this systematic approach to GA evaluations You also might consider adding an outsider to this process Finally I am amenable to discussing a role for me in the process I plan to continue to work on this valuation framework in an academic way eg for scholarly journals with Marc Epstein one of my colleagues in accounting who has done much with the balanced scorecard approach Once we have developed a clearer framework we would like to create a practitioner version that might be useful for your GA analysis Doug Schuler Associate Professor of Management Rice University Jesse H Jones

Cc Fein David I CHI Subject Imbalance Issues Janine As you might recall from the memo summarizing the Edison DST proceeding the Illinois Commerce Commission essentially punted on the imbalance issue instead deferring to FERC Attached is the section from our memo that discussed the imbalance issue It is my recollection that the issue of establishing subaccounts was not addressed We will try to confirm this tomorrow As lawyers please do not hesitate to call or email if we can be of any further assistance Christopher J Townsend Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle Street Chicago IL direct line direct fax Energy Imbalances Jurisdictional Issues The ARES Coalition Alliant and IIEC argued that the Commission should address energy imbalances in the proceeding Enron and NewEnergy abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly addressed within Edisons OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition the Commission would not address the propriety of FERCs asserted authority over energy imbalance issues The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at some future time Factual Policy Issues Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers containing the following provisions Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hours imbalances For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is or less or MW or less settlement is made at of outofpocket costs OPC regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed of their own individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of of OPC Adjustments are made to avoid doublecounting of adders and discounts applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount below These imbalance charges will be phasedin as follows From October through December No adder will apply under this provision From January through March adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Starting April adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs If the hourly imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load excluding PPO load is within the MW bandwidth no RES except those whose imbalance exceeds as noted below will be subject to an adder or discount PPO load will in aggregate be subject to the same terms and conditions as above but imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a MW deadband separately from all RES load Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish before applying a charge for energy imbalance According to Edison this feature will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging overscheduled megawatthours for underscheduled megawatthours in the same hour All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at of Edisons OPC Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the opening of the trading window The net retail energy imbalance in excess of MW will be charged an adder or discount of This charge will be allocated among RESs who are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds their individual deadband The allocation will be based on the ratioshare of the amount by which these individual RESs imbalances exceed their individual deadbands Any such adderdiscount will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Likewise any adderdiscount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with seasonal adjustments Edison will not require the installation of interval demand recorders for customers of less than kW at this time Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth ie no addersdiscounts when the imbalances are due to Edison interruptions and restorations or customer force majeure events that are in each case material to the RESs schedule and of which the RES could not reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC The IIEC opposed Edisons proposal and requested that the Commission require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution level Blackhawk also opposed Edisons proposal and supported the IIEC proposal Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy imbalance service at the distribution level MidAmerican opposed any effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances The Commission failed to weighin on the energy imbalance issue consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for such issues The Commission

responsiveness Better metering technology would certainly help Let me know when a good time would be Jim Original Message From Sullivan Kathleen Sent Thursday August AM To Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Steffes James D Montovano Steve Subject Highlights of the Recommended Decision in NYs Energy Competition Case Sarah Ive attached an article from todays Megawatt Daily regarding NYs generic energy competition case Ive also attached a summary of the RD written by Kevin Brocks our NESPA Counsel As you can see the RD dismisses aggressive migration measures until wholesale markets are functioning better Furthermore the RD states that until supplies increase and markets stabilize ratepayers must be protected In addition a PSC official is quoted as saying that it will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets and that it could be at least years before retail competition is viable Is there anything in the RTO Order or your participation thus far in the mediation process that could refute the claim that it will be or years until there is sufficient supply in NY to allow for workably competitive markets Kathleen File nespa rd highlights doc MegawattDaily New York PSC draft report sees competition in years New York regulatory staff expects comments tomorrow on a recommended decision about the future of competitive power market development in the state The recommended decision issued last month by two administrative law judges for the state Public Service Commission and a PSC official M says it will be another three to four years until there is sufficient supply in the state to allow for workably competitive markets and that it could be at least years before retail competition is viable Two principal problems in transitioning to a competitive market are inelastic supply and demand both of which are inherent in energy markets the proposed decision issued last month says Until supply consistently exceeds demand by a certain margin the PSC must play a prominent role in the states power markets Markets characterized by largely inelastic supply and demand where demand is approaching or is equal to supply are not workably competitive and will not produce just and reasonable rates the recommended decision says Until supplies increase ratepayers should be provided some measure of protection from those markets Once supply exceeds demand sufficiently to eliminate the exercise of excessive market power the markets can become workably competitive and will likely produce just and reasonable rates The recommended decision goes on to warn Unrealistic expectations concerning the timing of market development either too long or too short can have serious consequences to the public and can in the extreme result in the worst of all possible outcomes the creation of an unregulated monopoly If competition is assumed to develop very rapidly and wholesale market prices are imposed on customers without regulatory intervention and from a market that is not workably competitive higher prices and rates that do not meet the statutory standard of just and reasonable are likely On the other hand if a long transition is assumed and significant regulatory control continues to be exercised over prices competition and its benefits could be stifled indefinitely In March the PSC initiated the proceeding to examine the states progress toward competitive markets It sought information on the difficulties that have emerged lessons learned and directions for where to go next The recommended decision says that in a competitive market utilities should play no role in providing electric or gas service But before the PSC removes a utility from the market certain preconditions must be met including a determination that the wholesale and retail markets are operating without the exercise of market power As a general matter the utilities should not be removed from any market until multiple suppliers offering a variety of products are available for the entire customer class throughout the utilitys service territory The PSC also should wait for state lawmakers or the courts to confirm its authority to take such action The recommended decision also says that robust fully competitive retail markets will develop at different times for different customer classes The PSC should encourage investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure for both electricity and gas including if necessary ordering the franchised utilities to construct any needed facilities the recommended decision says Although the PSC should restate its support for retail competition and proceed with deliberate speed in fostering market development the agency should maintain just and reasonable rates throughout the period of transition to competition We are confident that a flexible oversight process that encourages competition and allows it to develop wherever the economics can support it will protect consumers during the transition permit markets to develop freely and will serve the public interest the recommended decision says Exceptions to the proposed decision are due tomorrow and responses are due Aug The judges and the PSC official plan to present a final recommended decision to the commission this fall JCS

tariff to include a new rate element That may get around the Settlement although OCA in PA will think that now D is going up and there is no offset in the G rate so consumers are getting screwed because they wont switch Also can the PaPUC implement this charge and direct the EDCs to transfer the funds to thirdparty generators Seems like that would require legislative changes I like the idea that there should be fixed charge for ICAP one way to get that number would be to go back to the EDC stranded cost cases and look at their filed testimony remember if they are earning more from the market than that amount they are overearning on their stranded costs Jim Original Message From Hoatson Tom Sent Monday August PM To Steffes James D Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Nicolay Christi L Cc Montovano Steve Subject RE Enron ICAP Strawman In response to the issues I would propose that the Reliability Tax modeled after the Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax GRFT and would be an additional line item on a utilitys bill In this way it is not an increase in either T or D and perhaps the waiver would not be required See related comment to issue below The proposal contemplates that the generators get the revenue this is their buyin to the proposal Taking PJM as the model they currently produce three load forecasts at varying temperatures one at a high temperature one at a low temperature and one at a designated temperature The proposal would set the obligation at the high temperature forecast and the costrecovery of the ICAP at the low temperature forecast maximizes the MWH charge Any overrecovery would be used to pay for system improvements Any underrecovery would be used in setting the recovery charge for the following year Conceptually this how it is intended to work However this needs to be thought through in a more detailed level Off hand I dont know what the current ICAP revenues are but I could find out As for the proposal the tax would be determined by the results of the ICAP auction eg PJM would go out for MW of ICAP review the bids and set the clearing price The total cost of ICAP MW x XMW would be used to set the Tax MWH charge using the low temperature forecast As a separate line item on the utilitys bill and presented as a tax the state regulators would have as much of a role in this tax as they have or had in the GRFT I see their biggest issue at this early stage of the strawman is what share of overrecovery do the ratepayers receive The argument that the overrecovery go to system improvements and not to the ratepayers is the efficiency improvement in the system Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Monday August PM To Hoatson Tom Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Nicolay Christi L Cc Montovano Steve Subject RE Enron ICAP Strawman Good start A couple of issues Raising transmission rates for the PA utilities would effectively reduce their Distribution revenues the Settlements stipulated that if T went up then D had to come down Maybe we could get everyone to agree to a onetime waiver of this and have endusers bills go up Where does the from the Reliability Tax go Toward what purpose If generators are not compensated in some manner maybe a passthrough directly wont they strongly oppose this model We need to propose some reasonable uses of these funds better metering to enable load curtailment to smaller customers OR maybe pay for an RMR type arrangement What is the current amount of ICAP market revenues today What would you recommend as a total tax The Reliability Tax would be FERC jurisdicitional as constructed How are the PUCs going to view this Will they have a role i setting the and the use Jim Original Message From Hoatson Tom Sent Friday August AM To Novosel Sarah Allegretti Daniel Fromer Howard Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Cc Montovano Steve Subject Enron ICAP Strawman In an email I sent yesterday I touched on an ICAP proposal Ive been thinking about and thought I would expand on it more The political reality of ICAP is that it is here to stay at least as long as there are energy price caps or retail rate caps ICAP is also a most likely outcome by regulators and politicos if energy prices are perceived to be too high assuming no price caps Therefore we need to come up with a system that is fair and doesnt prejudice any one participant especially if the participant is us The system I have been kicking around is one in which we would concede any trading opportunity in ICAP but would relieve our load servers with the obligation The ISOs particularly PJM and others have been stating that ICAP is required for reliability reasons While we can argue against this concept and try to convince these folks that operating reserves with a wellrun energy market is sufficient for reliability I dont think we are going to win its a battle of perception and unfortunately one mans perception is another mans reality For this reason ICAP should be the sole purview of the RTO The RTO is the one who has all the information on load forecasts and installed resources and is the one who performs the necessary analysis to determine reserve margins and obligations In PJM the staff would perform all calculations and present the results to the Reliability Committee for approval which would typically be approved unanimously I would propose that the RTO determine the annual ICAP obligation and then conduct an annual auction for the necessary resources I know that Enron does not want the RTO involved in the market but this would be no different than what the RTO does in a daily LMP market he receives bids stacks them determines the clearing price and dispatches according to the stack It would be the same for the ICAP auction The RTO would not be a participant in the market as such and is only the facilitator The total cost of ICAP would then be allocated to the transmission owners based on a prorata share of their installed load and recovered from load as a part of their revenue requirements ideally it would appear as a separate line item on an end users bill and be identified as a reliability tax so they would see what it is costing them This proposal while not perfect would accomplish the following It would satisfy the reliability concerns of the RTOs and politicians It would assess a tax on the load for reliability since load is the beneficiary assuming there is a benefit from ICAP of reliability It would relieve the LSEs of the burden and obligation of providing ICAP Deficiency penalties would not be required and accompanying deficiency rates would not need to be determined Generators would still receive ICAP income provided they are selected in the auction Since the ICAP obligation is typically for a period in the future in PJM the ICAP requirements approved this year are for the year the much talked about price signal for new generation is provided It allows the market to set the ICAP and not some artificial deficiency rate Market power issues associated with the existing ICAP markets are eliminated I kept the distribution of this proposal to a limited number to get a feel for this type of proposal If you are in general agreement with the concept I can formalize it and send it to a larger distribution including the commercial folks I would of course be interested in any comments or feedback you may have and would incorporate those into the document to be distributed to the larger group I think a concept of this could be sold to other participants and after we are satisfied with it I would solicit it to others outside of Enron to get their support

William S Kingerski Harry Savage Gord on Tribolet Michael SubjectRE Summary or PX Credit Proposals An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August SCE said that it h as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR Once the CPUC decides on the DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generationrelat ed CTC again There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond once QF contracts are above the market SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and rebill begining with Jan it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a onehalf cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of cents ma king it about cents that collects the million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge The half cent addition is for months Original Message From Curry

Proposals I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August th Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August th Current Issues The methodology for calculating PX credits after January is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies Applicability of the cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not Impact to Enron if FERC implements retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct thru January th which result in revised PX credits Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the g ross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationcomm odity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent wi ll be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an allowabl e claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possib le PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balan ces on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility pare nt level Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits ifwhen an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC Other consideration Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts PGE Recommended Approach This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January would include an avoided cost component This avoided cost component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDWR pur chases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchases This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX clearing p rice in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDWR purch ase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embedded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would hamper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from January through September and that the SCE approach is applicab le from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a comp romise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP and SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG E and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low However und erstanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and C PUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk but th is is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated with the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda Curry

Tuesday August AM To Steffes James D Mara Susan Subject RE One Other Note on Stranded Costs Let me make sure I understand this Prior to April the UDCs want the ir QF costs to be as low as possible since this will cause the PX credit t o be lower and thus the positive CTC higher However beginning April they pray for just the opposite the greater their QF costs the more t hey can collect from DA

Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ru ffer Mary Lynne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Cc Gorny Vladimir Bradford William S Kingerski Harry Savage Go rdon Tribolet Michael Subject RE Summary or PX Credit Proposals An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August SCE said that it h as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR Once the CPUC decides on the DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generationrelat ed CTC again There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond once QF contracts are above the market SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and rebill begining with Jan it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a onehalf cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of cents ma king it about cents that collects the million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge The half cent addition is for months Original Message From Curry Wanda Sent Friday August AM To Swain Steve Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ruffer Mary Lyn ne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Mara Susan Cc Gorny Vladimir Bradford William S Subject Summary or PX Credit Proposals I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August th Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August th Current Issues The methodology for calculating PX credits after January is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies Applicability of the cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not Impact to Enron if FERC implements retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct thru January th which result in revised PX credits Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the gross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationc ommodity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent will be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an all owable claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p ossible PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent level Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits if when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC Other consideration Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts PGE Recommended Approach This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu ary would include an avoided cost component This avoided cost component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDW R purchases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchase s This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX cle aring price in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDW R purchase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embe dded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would h amper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail port folio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from Jan uary through September and that the SCE approach is applicable from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa l Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP a nd SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe r PGE and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low Howev er understanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti es and CPUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk b ut this is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated wit h the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda Curry

James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Briggs Tom Alvarez Ray Shortridge Pat Long Chris Nersesian Carin Subject RE Report on AntiRTO Bill and on Andy Black Meeting Do we have alternative reliability language we can get to DOEFERC If not can we develop rather quickly Original Message From Shelk John Sent Thursday August PM To Shapiro Richard Robertson Linda Steffes James D Nicolay Christi L Novosel Sarah Briggs Tom Alvarez Ray Shortridge Pat Long Chris Nersesian Carin Subject Report on AntiRTO Bill and on Andy Black Meeting This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments the Aug nd introduction of an antiRTO bill or at least antimandatory RTOs and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall HR Reps Tom Sawyer DOH and Richard Burr RNC On Aug nd the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced HR the Interstate Transmission Act The legislation is bad because among other things it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs Also objectionable is that the bill would limit pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a reasonable transition mechanism or period for additive charges The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form structure and operating entity of any RTO In addition to the RTO language the bill has the old version of the NERC reliability legislation in it The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs repeals Federal Power Act sec on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company Barbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep Sawyers district Rep Burr is from North Carolina so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him I am checking into where Duke is on this issue Rep Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin so his support for this legislation is significant see Andy Black comment below Andy Black Meeting Andy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation He is only meeting with a few companies on a oneonone basis Enron Reliant Dynegy and TXU His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill the issue will be ripe for consideration in a HouseSenate conference committee Here is a run down of my comments and Andys comments on specific issues a RTOs Chairman Barton supports RTOs At a minimum the draft will affirm FERCs authority as the commissioners have requested Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps However Andy asked me to look at sec of the SawyerBurr referenced above which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the SawyerBurr bill is based on voluntary RTOs Hopefully he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects I will strongly encourage him to do the right thing in that regard b PUHCA The draft will use the Pickering bill HR Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enrons records even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate c PURPA Prospective repeal On back up power they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state d Interconnection They have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like I am contacting EPSA to get the details e Net Metering They are likely to include the Inslee bill to require net metering I explained our concern that the bills mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers including EES even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES per Jims helpful comments yesterday I need to get more information to Andy f Transmission Jurisdiction Thankfully Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction Specifically the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale the draft will not get into the bundledunbundled issue at all The draft will bring munis coops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes g Siting On siting Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches h Reliability On a negative note Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERCs version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support ie not PJM I explained our concerns He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate i Negawatts I raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list He said he is open to considering it again but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the California bill earlier this summer Your questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome

Daniel Staines Dan Hoatson Tom Montovano Steve Robertson Linda Subject Member Alert NYISO Argues for RTO Filing Reversal Attached is a summary prepared by IPPNY of the recently filed request for rehearing made by the NYISO I understand that a separate request for rehearing was filed by six of the eight NY tranmission owners NYSEG and RGE declined to sign on and have not filed any rehearing request Forwarded by Howard FromerNAEnron on AM Vanessa Anctil PM To IPPNY Members cc Gavin J Donohue Subject Member Alert NYISO Argues for RTO Filing Reversal Member Alert August NYISO Argues for RTO Filing Reversal The New York Independent System Operator wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to rethink its July order creating a northeastern Regional Transmission Organization RTO that would include New England New York and the PJM region In a filing made earlier this week the NYISO argued that the commission order ignored important reliability technical and engineering considerations Failing to consider these factors could result in serious harm to New York the NYISO filing says The NYISO is therefore submitting this rehearing request in order to ensure that the RTO formation effort does not lose sight of the needs of New Yorks economy or the wellbeing of its citizens The NYISO filing also asserts that the commission made substantial errors regarding several key legal issues The NYISO asked the commission to Reverse its decision on the scope and configuration of an RTO Reverse its determination that the entire northeast is a natural market Reverse the mandate that there be a single Northeast RTO Reverse its conclusion that the NYISO isnt independent enough from market participants Reverse its finding that the NYISOs operational authority tariff filing rights congestion management parallel path flow procedures and interregional coordination efforts fall short of RTO standards The NYISO was joined in its Aug filing by Central Hudson Gas and Electric Consolidated Edison Nigara Mohawk Power Corporation New York State Electric and Gas Orange and Rockland Utilities and Rochester Gas and Electric The FERC should clarify that even if the NYISO proposal was deficient in the issue of parallel path flow management and transmission planning that it could still qualify as an RTO because those issues will be resolved by the NYISO argues The NYISO asked the FERC to either declare it an RTO or permit it to make a compliance filing to fix any deficiencies that would prevent it from reaching RTO status And finally the NYISO argues that if FERC continues to insist that there be a single RTO in the northeast that it should initiate a rulemaking process so that it may more thoroughly evaluate the technical details costs benefits and implications of various RTO formation operations Currently FERC is conducting a series of hearings on the proposed RTO to outline the issues that have to be addressed FERCs July order is overly simplistic and ignores policy mistakes in California that confirm the need for a more thoughtful approach to RTO issues the NYISO filing says The RTO FERC wants to impose on the northeast would be electrically and geographically enormous and include a number of severe transmission constraints and dense electrically complex subregions the filing says A system of this size and complexity has never been attempted before It is not known whether such a system could be efficiently operated or whether existing ISO software systems would be capable of managing it the NYISO filing says FERC ordered the creation of this superRTO without any analysis of the challenges costs benefits and other implications of the single RTOsingle market model the NYISO filing says It has declined to evaluate seriously available RTO policy alternatives that could be more efficient The NYISO filing also criticizes FERC for insisting that PJM market rules and software be used in this proposed Northeast RTO without assessing how well they will work when applied to New York or the entire Northeast This is an unduly precipitous approach that should be reconsidered on rehearing the NYISO filing says The three existing ISOs have already committed to implementing standardized market rules and common transactionscheduling procedures and other seams solutions that would result in all the benefits the RTO is supposed to bring the NYISO filing says Dumping these efforts will retard RTO development instead of accelerate it the NYISO argues The FERC order ignores some of the existing physical constraints in the transmission systems that prevent more power flowing between ISOs the NYISO filing says Creation of an RTO will not increase interISO trade and there will continue to be three distinct markets in the northeast the filing says The NYISO filing also argues that the PJM market the FERC is advocating as the model for the northeast could just as easily be considered a part of the Midwest region While PJM can export megawatts to New York it can export megawatts to West Virginia and Ohio and megawatts to Virginia the filing points out In general while the commission has asserted that there are four natural electricity markets in the United States it hasnt spelled out the boundaries the filing says This is emblematic of the lack of analytical rigor that characterizes the commissions approach to market definition the filing says This approach allows Allegheny Energy and SPP utilities for example to choose between two RTOs while northeastern utilities are not offered a choice the filing says The NYISO also argued against FERC conclusions that the New York operator could qualify as an RTO because it lacked sufficient size could not achieve effective scope and wasnt independent enough from its market participants These holdings are unlawful arbitrary and capricious the filing says FERC is making an unexplained and sudden departure from the principles it establishing in Order No that spelled out what an RTO should be the filing says FERC also denied the NYISO and member systems a chance to modify the NYISO RTO proposal to address the concerns the commission raised the filing say For more

email if we can be of any further assistance Christopher J Townsend Piper Marbury Rudnick Wolfe N LaSalle Street Chicago IL direct line direct fax Energy Imbalances Jurisdictional Issues The ARES Coalition Alliant and IIEC argued that the Commission should address energy imbalances in the proceeding Enron and NewEnergy abandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison Staff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly addressed within Edisons OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC The Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the harm of delay to retail competition the Commission would not address the propriety of FERCs asserted authority over energy imbalance issues The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at some future time Factual Policy Issues Edison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers containing the following provisions Energy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and settlements will occur on a cash basis for each hours imbalances For those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is or less or MW or less settlement is made at of outofpocket costs OPC regardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error Those RESs whose energy imbalances exceed of their own individual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of of OPC Adjustments are made to avoid doublecounting of adders and discounts applicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount below These imbalance charges will be phasedin as follows From October through December No adder will apply under this provision From January through March adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Starting April adderdiscount will apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed of their schedules or more of the hours of the month If the of the hours are exceeded the adderdiscount shall apply to all hours Edison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance attributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs If the hourly imbalance caused by all unbundled retail load excluding PPO load is within the MW bandwidth no RES except those whose imbalance exceeds as noted below will be subject to an adder or discount PPO load will in aggregate be subject to the same terms and conditions as above but imbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a MW deadband separately from all RES load Edison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves to offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish before applying a charge for energy imbalance According to Edison this feature will allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging overscheduled megawatthours for underscheduled megawatthours in the same hour All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at of Edisons OPC Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the opening of the trading window The net retail energy imbalance in excess of MW will be charged an adder or discount of This charge will be allocated among RESs who are out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds their individual deadband The allocation will be based on the ratioshare of the amount by which these individual RESs imbalances exceed their individual deadbands Any such adderdiscount will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Likewise any adderdiscount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph will be billed separately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading Load profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with seasonal adjustments Edison will not require the installation of interval demand recorders for customers of less than kW at this time Energy imbalances will be assumed to be within the bandwidth ie no addersdiscounts when the imbalances are due to Edison interruptions and restorations or customer force majeure events that are in each case material to the RESs schedule and of which the RES could not reasonably be aware in sufficient time to adjust the schedule Edison will include a description of the methodology for determining OPC in its energy imbalance schedules filed with the FERC The IIEC opposed Edisons proposal and requested that the Commission require Edison to offer an optional imbalance service at the distribution level Blackhawk also opposed Edisons proposal and supported the IIEC proposal Alliant also supported Edison being required to offer an energy imbalance service at the distribution level MidAmerican opposed any effort by the Commission to exert jurisdiction on energy imbalances The Commission failed to weighin on the energy imbalance issue consistent with its determination that the FERC is the appropriate forum for such issues The Commission reserved the right to address the

ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a

follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the gross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationc ommodity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent will be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an all owable claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p ossible PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on

bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchase s This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX cle aring price in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDW R purchase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embe dded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would h amper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail port folio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from Jan uary through September and that the SCE approach is applicable from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa l Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP a nd SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe r PGE and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low Howev er understanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti es and CPUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk b ut this is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated wit h the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know

Original Message From Dadson Aleck Sent Tuesday August AM To Shapiro Richard Steffes James D Subject FW Ontario Market Opening Strategy Importance High As I discussed earlier with Rick sasha Jacob is leaving GPC at the end of the month to join another firm sash is particularly valuable becuase of his impeccable connections with Jim Wilson the Minister of energy and the staffers on the government side of the Legislature What I wouldnt mind talking through with you is the continuing need for assistance re the media here as Tom McLaren proposes I think we need it and Peter Varley would be good to work with in that regard he is the Premiers former Press Secretary and has conections with the major Toronto dilies that have proved helpful Original Message From McLaren Tom mailto Sent Tuesday August AM To Dadson Aleck Subject Ontario Market Opening Strategy Importance High Aleck Further to our phone call as promised I am sending you this email to confirm our interest in ensuring that Enron Canada can secure the consulting resources it requires at the current time to ensure an expeditious and assured opening of Ontarios electrical power market As well as you know we have superior resources in Alberta and elsewhere to augment your government relations media and public affairs resources I would like to meet with you today or early Wednesday to discuss an amended goingforward task assignment for GPC given the likelihood of assigning the Queens Park contact program to Sasha or his new firm I would ask that should you be successful in concluding an engagement agreement with Sasha or his firm that you inform us and I will have our inhouse counsel confirm the removal of any restrictive covenants that Sasha has with GPC that would prevent him from doing consulting work with you While the contact program you want Sasha to work on is key to your objectives it is nonetheless only one element of a comprehensive campaign so whatever your arrangements with Sasha or his firm may be we see GPCs critical areas of support as follows GPC would continue to provide strategic advice on the overall program to secure Enron Canadas market opening in Ontario including advice to you on the Queens Park Contact Program Assuming that you will be working with Sasha to execute the Queens Park contact program we still believe that our assessment of the situation will be very valuable particularly with the opposition parties and for giving you an independent back channel to gauge your success GPC would also provide advice to you on the management of other important stakeholders such the municipal utilities major power consumers consumer and environmentalsocial advocates and others who may slow down or derail the market reforms Regarding the opposition parties we endorse your strategy of maintaining the current support of the Official Opposition Liberals GPC is well positioned to assist in this political arena It should be separated from the government program in our view if possible The media will also perform a pivotal role in shaping the publics understanding of the issue In this respect we would recommend that GPCs Peter Varley assist you Our approach would be to ensure that the major media outlets in key government constituencies are targeted to have an accurate and favourable response to Enron Canadas position Ideally we would work to ensure that these outlets are proactively supportive of the market opening in their respective editorial positions and that Enron is a preferred media contact This would enable you be in a better position to shape the media debate To accomplish this we would recommend both a proactive and reactive approach ie media plan contact program program delivery and daytoday monitoring and rapid response Aleck this is much like we did for project Stanley GPC would also develop all collateral materials for all audiences including the media government regulators and market stakeholders This would include briefing notes QA media releases policy papers etc Outside Ontario there are other concerns including some current issues underway in Alberta which Enron Canada should be alerted to from time to time and GPC can help you understand those concerns as they arise and assess the value of strategic intervention As we discussed I will be the overall account manager for GPC and I strongly recommend that you Sasha and I meet as a team twice a month to coordinate our efforts and to exchange intelligence I have also reviewed our current contractual arrangement with you our letter agreement from June and I believe a new contract is not required as our current contract would seem to be appropriate It sets out a comprehensive set of deliverables which covers all the points I have outlined above and an agreed understanding between you and me on a budget will fit within the terms of that contract Once again Aleck thanks for your support and patience and as you can tell we value your business very highly I will call you to set up a convenient time to meet to ensure this overview is consistent with our discussions and also to review with you the members of the GPC team Tom McLaren Executive Vice

Hansen Subject Rate Agreement II Apparently the link to the Senate website which contains information on todays Senate Energy Committee hearing does not work Therefore I have cut and paste the

Room August pm I Opening Comments Senator Debra Bowen Chairwoman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee Senator Bill Morrow ViceChairman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee II Panelists Stan Dirks California Department of Water Resources Chris Warner Pacific Gas Electric Gary Schoonyan Southern California Edison Jim Hay San Diego Gas Electric Mike Florio The Utility Reform Network Dave Morse Office of Ratepayer Advocates Dan Carroll California Industrial Users Douglas Heller Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Bill Julian California Public Utilities Commission BACKGROUND At the peak of Californias electricity crisis two of Californias investorowned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on behalf of their customers AB x Keeley Chapter Statutes of authorized the California Department of Water Resources DWR to begin buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego Gas Electric ratepayers as well as to issue bonds to finance such purchases DWR wasnt authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back those purchases Instead it was authorized to recover the money needed to pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to consumers and to perform is own reasonableness review of those costs The California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC discretion to perform a reasonableness review is rarely abrogated an exception being the costs of collective bargaining agreements but AB x made an exception in this case for two basic reasons First if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power costs from being passed along to ratepayers the effect would be to simply shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers Second the goal of a reasonableness review which is to create an incentive to do the best possible job on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR s accountability to ratepayers The theory was the political process would provide the check on DWRs activities much in the same way customers provide a check on the activities of a municipal utility To fulfill its obligations under AB x DWR spent billion through May That money was originally loaned from the General Fund In addition the state obtained a shortterm bank loan of billion to help pay for ongoing electricity purchases That shortterm loan the outstanding debt owed to the General Fund and the difference between actual electricity costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a billion bond offering which was authorized by SB x Burton Chapter Statutes of and may take place as early as October DWR has stated that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of actions on August one of which is to approve the DWRconstructed Rate Agreement Agreement between DWR and the CPUC The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance that the CPUC will allow DWRs electricity power purchase costs to be recovered in a timely manner Specifically the Agreement Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWRs right to recover its selfdetermined revenue requirement as specified Defines DWRs revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds the cost of DWRs electricity procurement including the longterm contracts administrative consulting and legal costs and the cost of demand management programs Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWRs revenue requirement within days or days as determined by DWR Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond financing JP Morgan the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds has similarly stated that without the Agreement the bonds wont be viewed as investment grade quality thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC A number of parties including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible for paying the rates along with the investorowned utilities have commented on DWRs proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns The Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds Issues Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider Must an Agreement be Signed AB x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR but such an agreement is not required by the statute Given the irrevocable nature of DWRs proposed Agreement is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the agreement or will some other less binding agreement suffice One alternate approach to the Agreement is SB xx Burton which provides a dedicated rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a part of its costs SB xx passed the Senate on July and is pending at the Assembly desk Public Review DWRs revenue requirement at least as it pertains to power purchase costs bond repayment and associated administrative costs clearly isnt subject to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB x Rather than have an independent party like the CPUC review its efforts AB x envisioned that public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible job to get the best value possible for ratepayers However the Agreement neither contemplates nor provides for public review which has raised concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the Agreement Scope of Revenue Requirement AB x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds power purchases and associated administrative costs The Agreement submitted by DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those costs including the cost of demand management programs and legal consulting and technical services By including such costs in the Agreement these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the CPUC The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to create and administer some of these programs with mixed success However DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for considering and approving such programs Given the lack of a public process and DWRs lack of expertise on demand management programs is it appropriate to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the Agreement and Day Review The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow DWR to recover its revenue requirement within days or days if DWR finds that an expedited change is necessary This is an extremely short window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full public review and comment Auditing DWRs revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the states investorowned utilities Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that appropriate revenues are provided to DWR that surplus revenues are returned to ratepayers and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWRs accounts Court Challenges The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds to repay the General Fund and the shortterm loan Its possible that some party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC decisions ie establishing the DWR revenue requirement creating a servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities etc in either federal or state court How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds Contract Renegotiation The DWR contracts negotiated at the height of the energy crisis are viewed by some as expensive The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances The Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its revenue requirement including the cost of the contracts it has already signed Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWRs ability or incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts Does it eliminate any incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future contracts that it may sign since the costs of those contracts wont be subject to review or adjustment

most of the interaction on RTOs that I have had is with the Governors and more specifically the western govs so my comments are directed to them but I think these suggestions could work for other influencers as well RTOs are not a readily understandable issue for a governor who has issues every week to cover nor is there a natural constituency that would politically support a governor getting involved nor is it an issue that they care aboutthey just want the lights to go on and their voters to have moderate prices and reliability and for the energy crisis to go away if they perceive that it is affecting them Those that know a little bit about the RTOs are following their incumbent utility lead in opposing a west wide RTO they are invoking the states rights mantra and they dont want to be in the same playground as California I would suggest that we need materialsinformation probably a power point of pagesas follows A description of the RTOs and generally what our position is in plain english in sentences or less A minimum of or analogies to a well designed RTO The analogies need to be fleshed outie cover all objections and questions The one that comes to mind is Eisenhower and the federal highway systemwhenhow it happened who protested and why they were wrong how great the highway system was for the economy and quality of life etc Governors need something they can use as a sound bite and something they understand well to use as an analogy They do not want to look stupid and most of them know little about energy and so we need to give them something very simple to use as their underlying reasoning for supporting our position Identify and describe only the the or most important specific issues that we need to see addressed in the RTOsnative load exemption gonecongestion management solutionstiming or whatever Steffes and team identify Specifically set out what the objections of other parties would be to the governor supporting our position on those issues identified this is key in making sure that they trust our information and it also makes sure that they are prepared to answer the objections Specifically set out what the answer is to overcome those objections Provide positive effects of a governor agreeing with the or issueswhy heshe should take our position ie better reliability more transmission or generation will be built if system is

Gallagher Julie Simon Mark Bennett Michael Reddy george Wcom Subject Future FERC Involvement and Proposed Schedule for SoutheastRTO UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Regional Transmission Organizations Docket No RT To Honorable Bobbie J McCartney The Electric Power Supply Association EPSA has welcomed the opportunity to give you input during the Southeast mediation proceeding EPSA and its members would like to thank you and your team for taking time from the proceeding to share your insights hear our views and answer our questions We now want to provide you with additional input from generators and marketers in the form of proposed milestones and deadlines regarding continued FERC involvement after the mediation We recognize your schedule and hope these brief points will be appropriate prior to your receipt of responses to the strawmen FERCs Continued Involvement EPSA strongly supports FERCs continued involvement in the development of one Regional Transmission Organization RTO for the Southeast EPSA believes such continued involvement is critical to achieving RTO market operations in the Southeast as soon as possible We cannot overestimate the damage to market efficiency and consumer benefits that result from continued delays to full competition a problem that plagues the entire country It was very encouraging to hear of your support for this involvement and desire to get input from market participants regarding how this can be done after the day settlement period has ended EPSA would like to make procedural suggestions for the postmediation period that would include continued Commission involvement that is deemed critical to the formation of a single Southeast RTO We hope that the following suggestions are helpful when you are developing your report to the Commission on the mediation results The Southeast Power Grid model will be an evolutionary process following the end of the mediation Several issue areas are still likely to be the focus of significant debate and will require a collaborative process that the stakeholders will remain responsible for establishing Resolving these issues and more importantly their associated details will be critical to the enduring success of the eventual Southeast Power Grid The Commissions continued involvement is critical to the formation of a seamless power grid Additionally regional market participants can benefit from firsthand FERC input on previous rulings from other regions This can help prevent any future Southeast Power Grid filings from attempting to establish rules protocols and plans that are contrary to Commission precedent Moreover it prevents disagreements between stakeholders on specific points from stalling the process and potentially resulting in a deficient filing Potentially FERC will incur added costs of travel and staff time however filings that follow FERCs current thinking will more than offset these costs The Commissions presence in the process going forward will prevent any future delay by providing ongoing dialogue between regulators and market participants This will shortcut the timeconsuming sequence of internal negotiations filing filing response and hopefully obviate the need for going through the sequence repeatedly FERC presence will also help prevent parties from becoming polarized in their views during negotiations without feeling a need to compromise Future stakeholder meetings in the Southeast Power Grid process will work best by involving two FERC staff representatives and to avoid exparte concerns EPSA recognizes that any meeting attended by Commission staff must be publicly noticed These Commission staff representatives need to be knowledgeable of the Southeast process and can serve as backups to one another Consequently if a situation arises where one staffer cannot participate in a meeting the alternate should be able to stand in as a proxy for the other Commission representative The mediation process will have its value increased if the Commissions staff representatives are empowered to correct procedural problems that emerge in the process as it moves forward For example if the Commissions staff finds that meeting minutes do not reflect stakeholder decisions or consensus on a given issue or they are not being disseminated to process participants in a systematic manner they can ensure that problems are rectified Making expedient changes as the subsequent process unfolds after the day mediation period is over will confirm that the successes of the mediation continue and that parties continue to work collaboratively Staff involvement will give the Commission the ability to monitor the process during the postmediation period If questions arise during postmediation period staff can supply onthespot answers or coordinate with senior staff to get answers to the parties quickly The efficiency of this established feedback channel ensures that negotiations between parties do not bog down and hinder the completion of the overall process over a single issue Moreover the presence of Commission staff assists in maintaining a cooperative approach between the parties as is evidenced in our mediation process Having Commission representatives in the field for the Southeast Power Grid process can prove valuable as a way for FERC to continue to engage state public utility commissions and remain responsive to their concerns as details about the Grid organization get refined The involvement of state commissions is integral to the success of more competitive wholesale markets in the Southeast A FERC presence going forward will allow federal and state regulators to confer on the benefits to consumers of successful competitive wholesale and ultimately retail power markets State regulators comfort level could be increased if the process continues with an ongoing FERC presence Proposed Milestones and Deadlines The following schedule still assumes some form of convergence between the existing structures EPSA continues to believe that a single Southeast RTO can be formed in a timely manner that will provide certainty to the market steadily reduce business risks for those who have and will invest in the Southeast and provide consumers with the quickest path to a costeffective market structure all while maintaining the reliability of the existing system Sept Begin post mediation process and resume RTO development Sept Section Filing consistent with mediation settlement reached Oct Start stakeholder input process identification or Advisory Committee establishment Nov Dec Start and complete selection of Board immediately followed by selection of MarketSystem Administrator Dec Filing with Commission on completed consensus Order op date documents and status report Feb File with Commission any outstanding organic documents Mar Market Monitor Selection process completed Apr Commission Response Mar Jun Asset Transfers Staff established Jun RTO becomes operational with Day market system Dec Day market system implemented Order Requirement We appreciate your taking the time to hear our suggestions We have great confidence in your command over these proceedings and that they will lead to a single competitive market for power in the Southeast

longterm contracts Everyone This is hot news showing that the CAISOCDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought I am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and FERCs attention According to two sources the CAISO is helping to bail Gov Davis out of his highpriced CDWR longterm power contracts by purchasing CDWRs excess energy as an Out Of Market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the CAISOs Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff The costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISOs surreptitious transactions This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy RealTime auction first CAISO Tariff Dispatch Protocol section d Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids can the CAISO buy Out Of Market OOM energy If the CAISO were following the Tariff CDWRs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energywhich is often as low as Therefore under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as Therefore the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it While there is no evidence that Gov Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first this behavior clearly benefits Davis Absent the CAISOs purchases of CDWRs excess energy CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers The media has been been making hay out of Daviss strategy of buying high and selling low Therefore Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts Of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the CAISO The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who frequently seeing minute Ex Post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to These SCs are in for a big surprise According to one source at Sierra Pacific the CAISO charged him as much as MWh for imbalance energy Where is the price mitigation here Who benefits under this scam Davis and CDWR Who loses under this scam Instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy Sources Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and the Friday Burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito There is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market OOM calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post BEEP market As one of our faithful observers told me The ISO will be billing some DRWCERS longterm contracts to SCs as OOM energy This has been confirmed by the ISO This means there is no realtime price transparency We may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual RealTime settlement price There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesnt post that information The implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERCs goals of creating open transparent markets Here is the email from our CAISO representative Original

summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO His response was this that the CAISO is charging regardless of the INC and DEC prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS In effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS Kit

Janet Mara Susan Robertson Linda Kingerski Harry Denne Karen Palmer Mark A PR Shapiro Richard Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Subject Important Update on California Legislation Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzbergs chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today With respect to DA the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend DA The Governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize So it looks like the Governors plan is to have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of and have the PUC temporarily suspend DA from September to Were continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August yesterday will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs behalf between Jan and the date of the switch The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept be responsible for DWR going forward contracts though details of how that would work were not clear The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August rd date is to prevent a rush to Direct Access between now and Sept There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept Finally the bill apparently will also give selfgeneration priority over Direct Access in each open season The bill would set aside MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen If the self gen is not subscribed the MWs would go to DA The bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly The politicians are very reluctant to pass any Edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing But the Governor is working the bill very hard Mirant is actively working against the bill Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose reelection Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes The bill also has to make it through the Senate Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President John Burton who said flatly that hes not doing anything But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is With respect to the bills provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers Edison also said that under the Assembly version of the bill Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds More info to follow as it becomes available If anyone has any questions dont hesitate to contact me Best Jeff Original Message From Dasovich Jeff Sent Wednesday August PM To Dasovich Jeff Subject Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis and Hertzbergs staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers They also said that favorable provisions with respect to selfgen would also be added to the bill They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow Note In addition to the DA provisions the bill also includes provisions that explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edisons undercollection and permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of Edisons debt for Edisons management and shareholders to address Summary of Direct Access provisions The program would begin January Its unclear what would happen to DA between now and January Presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the California PUC days after the effective date of the bill and every months thereafter DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position Every months the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA KWandabove customers would have days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season under kw customers would have days Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying the customers proportionate share of the utilitys undercollection and the customers proportionate share of DWRs receivables if any for power previously delivered by DWR but not yet fully paid for by customers In addition if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed Best Jeff

Charles Mi essner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject IMPORTANT Motion of San Diego Gas Electric Company U E for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers The utility requests a day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September September is a Satur day Reply comments would be filed days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of approximately of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment period would last for days and commence days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over or undercommitment In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a reentry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a neart erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and reentry fee s should also apply There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings Please let me and others know if you

comments below Original Message From Cohen Louis Sent Thursday August AM To Jeffrey D Dan Watkiss Email Palansky IJay Plotnick Michael Cc Sarah Novosel Email Killory Ted Frankel Jonathan Cohen Louis Subject Order Argument Please think about the following In a minute Supreme Court argument the limit will be strictly observed one needs to be ready to answer questions of all sorts but one cannot co unt on being able to make more than points and each of them needs to b e clear from the first sentence points that require development dont work In light of that Should I plan to spend any minutes on the New York side of the case ie arguing that all transmissions over the grids are in interstate co mmerce and FERC has jurisdiction whether the ensuing sale is wholesale or r etail On the one hand the NY issue is more important to Enron than th e Enron issue on the other hand my sense is that we are way ahead on th e NY issue after the briefs and the SG will likely do a good job on it in argument My sense is that I should be prepared if necessary to utter so mething like the starred portion of the first sentence of this paragraph a nd to defend it against any questions but should not otherwise plan to get into these issues We should probably also have a canned sentence ready to address NYs wacky preemption argument which the one that it relied on most heavily in its op ening brief I think my most important tasks are to make clear that i this case is about FERCs power to require nondiscriminatory access to the interstate grids and not about rates or state regulation of retail sales and ii i t is important to the nation that FERC have such power I need to make the se points quickly and vividly in a way that the Justices will carry away That is going to be hard because theoretical abstractions are not vivid examples take too long to develop and provoke quarrels about details and m etaphors are generally too inexact Please consider whether I am right abo ut the two points being most important and think about how to make them I think these points are the most important along with making the Court c omfortable with the idea that if they adopted our position they would not b e turning upside down a federalstate regulatory division thats been in pl ace for years Although in a formal sense our case turns on the Chevron issue plain language no ambiguity hence no room for discretion my instinct but I am not at all sure about this is that I should not plan to devote time to these matters First they are covered well in the briefs Second whethe r one sees ambiguity does not really depend on staring at the language bu t on understanding what transmission in interstate commerce necessarily c overs in the present age In other words the way to win the Chevron point is to win the points in the previous paragraph Hence I ought to prepare to get the word unambiguous in there somewhere in the middle of a sentenc e and defend it if necessary but not do more Does this seem right I think its worth giving a little more attention since this is the key iss ue below and ultimately the issue on which the Court must rest its decisi on We dont want to lose the trees for the forest That said since wev e dealt with it at length in the briefs I dont know that we need much mor e than a reminder of the issue and the arguments FERC asserts that sectio n b does not unambiguously determine whether transmission bundled with retail sale is a transmission or a sale of electric energy at wholesale It concluded that such transmission is a sale The DC Circuit erroneou sly held that FERCs interpretation was permissible But transmission does nt stop being transmission merely because it is sold together with generat ion it is both transmission and a necessary component query whether com ponent is the best word to use of a retail sale Therefore under the cl ear language of section b jurisdiction over all transmissions includ ing transmissions bundled with retail sales is vested in FERC On the related point of NYs position that the wholesaleretail bright line applies to transmission in particular light of NYs interpretive gymnast ics in its reply re a at p isnt a good oneliner simply that i f Congress intended to limit FERCs transmission jurisdiction to transmissi ons for wholesale then s b would read The provisions of this subcha pter shall apply to the sale of electric energy at wholesale and all associ ated transmissions or something to that effect Note this issue opens the door to discussion of among other things whet her the exclusive purpose of section b was to fill the Attleboro gap and questions about the structure of the FPA eg the relationship betwee n b and d etc What do I do in argument with LPL I find the NGA parallel very comp elling and IF the Court decides to go with us it will have no problem citi ng and following that case On the other hand the argument does not seem to have persuaded anybody but our team not CADC for example On balance I am inclined to say The Court has already decided this issue under the p arallel provision of the NGA and use some time to press that point One r eason for doing so is that in general it will be much EASIER for the Court just to affirm FERC and CADC than to push thru the complexities and agree w ith us but LPL gives them both a precedent for overruling FERC on its own jurisdiction and a comparatively easy way thru the case Agreed I need to understand why FERCs powers and plans to create regional tra nsmission organizations do not fully solve the problem I need to get a de tailed understanding of the facts and a onesentence answer to why there i s still a problem The primary answer in our reply is that Order does not require RTOs i t only encourages their voluntarily formation and that theres no indicati on that monopolists will give up their market power unless compelled p Most important What other points in addition to and does anyone think I need to be sure to make Even more important what points made by NY SG EEI California are most likely to trouble the Court and provoke q uestions Which of them should I plan to answer even if I get no question We might also need to address whether our position runs against years of history Didnt the states regulate all aspects of bundled retail sales u ntil Order Does our position mean that FERC historically abdicated it s responsibility and the states were regulating without authority What is the effect of section a if not to allow states to continue to regulat e the matters that they regulated in This may be an issue to broach only if the Court indicates interest though since I think its the toughe st one for us to answer We might also reconsider our position that unbundling is merely an accounti ng issue It seems to me that reversing the position we took in our initia l brief will basically hedge our bets it makes our affirmative argument a little harder since we cant simply say that its crazy to base FERCs ju risdiction on an accounting technique but it also makes NYs argument har der since they cant simply say that but for a change in the accounting fo r electric service the states would still be regulating interstate transmis sions for retail sale This would also dovetail with some of the other bri efs that made a strong argument that unbundling is a major change in electr ic service necessary to support competition among generators and something over which the states have never exercised jurisdiction Thanks to all for thinking about this

Cazalet Purdum Curtis Kebler Curt Hatton Corby Gardiner Charles Mi essner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject IMPORTANT Motion of San Diego Gas Electric Company U E for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers The utility requests a day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September September is a Satur day Reply comments would be filed days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of approximately of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment period would last for days and commence days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over or undercommitment In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a reentry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a neart erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and reentry fee s should also apply There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings

As you can see Leslie and I have been working extensively with Stephanie Miller for the last few weeks as she is trying to find a way to get rid of our MMBtuday of Block capacity on El Paso In fact I provided Stephanie an analysis of the regulatory history as far back as last March even before we signed up for the capacity You will probably be getting some questions about it from Barry or maybe even Lavarato before too long since getting rid of this asset is very high on their priority list I wanted you to be up to speed on our input so far Original Message From Lawner Leslie Sent Wednesday September PM To Cantrell Rebecca W Miller Stephanie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP The CPUC was heavily involved in the settlement and their interest is making sure that northern CA has access to the SJ supplies Their concern is not the same as PGEs And to the extent anything is agreed to reopening the settlement is an enormous can of worms and I dont think we want to go there We would have to be able to structure a side deal to where PGE and SoCal are in agreement that the recall rights they got in the settlement can be waived Original Message From Cantrell Rebecca W Sent Wednesday September AM To Miller Stephanie Cc Lawner Leslie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP Steph Leslie and I were just talking about this and one thing we need to keep in mind is that

Miller Stephanie Cc Cantrell Rebecca W Subject FW June order on Rehearing RP and RP I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Pasos interpretation of the hours recall rights Regulatory treatment of the million by PGE is a CPUC issue I just talked to Becky and I dont have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more Original Message From Lawner Leslie Sent Tuesday September AM To Miller Stephanie Cc Cantrell Rebecca W Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP As to the hour recall I can only tell you what the FERC order says I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the recall to work The order is fairly terse and just says and if it so recalled by PGE that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PGE service territory upon hours notice The language says to me that you can recall it hours before you want to use it However I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it As to the traditional rate making valuation of the million I have to confess I dont understand what you mean PGE paid the million as part of a negotiated settlement Typically that is part of a black box settlement meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment but I would doubt it If your question relates to how PGE is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out Original Message From Miller Stephanie Sent Tuesday September AM To Lawner Leslie Subject RE June order on Rehearing RP and RP When is the hour notice on rerecall effective hours from the day of recall varies depending on term or hours before the recall is supposed to start How would you value whats left of the million that PGE paid based upon traditional rate making policies

Message From Williams Robert C Sent Friday September PM To Steffes James D Subject FW California AGs InvesigatorGray Davis Customer Contact Original Message From Williams Robert C Sent Friday September PM To Sharp Vicki Delainey David Cc Haedicke Mark E Whalley Greg Dietrich Janet Leff Dan Jim NRON Sanders Richard B Subject RE California AGs InvesigatorGray Davis Customer Contact We are considering four courses of action a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract a suit for an injuntion against the AG a letter of to our customers and a letter to the press from one of our customers California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday If California law does provide for such a waiver we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation Still if we can get evidence that the AGs investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors The letter would lay out the truth about the California energy crisis and DavisLockyers misguided and politicallymotivated search for a scapegoat We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashis statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was created in part by all arms of the California government to support our case We could also use published reports if verifiable about the DWRs imprudent purchases of power and cast the AGs investigation as an attempt to divert attention from DavisLockyers lack of any success in addressing the the crisis We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric and for continuing to be our business partners We would want this to be positive in tone A fourth response would be a letter from one or more of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AGs office This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers We are still thinking of other approaches We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest Please call me with any questions or

else at this point If nothing else it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result so they cant say no one told them dn Original Message Date pm Tuesday From AL ALEXANDERSON To IXGateWIZ CC DOUGLAS NICHOLS Subject RENew Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the billion shortage to sellers Were still trying to get Enron guidance on this Possibly wed rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution Im traveling with my cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list Sorry for the mixed signals al Howard J Weg PM I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues As you know I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible and to protect the interests of all members Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee

the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge nerators may have withheld power the basic argument is that DEREGULATIO N ITSELF NOT FAIL RATHER IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED In addition the paper states that MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIAS ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE S TO THE STATES RESTRUCTURING PLAN BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE ELECTRICIT Y DEREGULATION In addition Californias response of DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat on the Refund case The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental market conditions and the States poor plan and actions created the financi al and political crisis The CBO finds that WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKETbecause FEATURES OF THE RESTR UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF THE ELECTRICITY MARKET Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out toge ther with our details of the policy failures This CBO report clearly und ercuts the political arguments of the Davis administration who had every opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l ongterm contracts but has passed through of the high costs to consume rs Jim Original Message From Shelk John SentTuesday October PM ToPerrino Dave CcRobertson Linda Steffes James D SubjectRE Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis by the CBO Subject to receiving more information my recommendation is not to make a federal case out of the CBO report In other words we should be aware of Daves comments and concerns but I would not suggest we contact CBO or an ything like that If others think some response is needed this is the typ e of thing EPSA should do if done at all We should refrain from carrying water for the generators The report is being written up favorably in the trade press I have seen largely because the CBO report says that what Cal ifornia did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by dere gulation That feet view is worth a mint politically and while th ere are parts of the report that we differ with I think its value far outw eighs its blemishes Original Message From Perrino Dave SentTuesday October PM ToShelk John CcRobertson Linda Steffes James D SubjectRE Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis by the CBO John My take on the paper is that is wasnt particularly flattering to the gener atorssuppliers It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had addressed and that the ISO did not implement It is reasonably sound as f ar as history of the formation is concerned but some of their statements and conclusions I have to take issue with Off the top of my head they use the term idle In my mind as a utility person idle means available but just not running As they apply the term they use it to describe any unit not running either because it was forced off or was off for maintenance I realize its only a word but it carries many different inferences mostly unfavorable Early in the document they refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su pply to manipulate the price They never substantiate this claim In fact as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric es but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und erstood the full picture They also dont really touch on the lack of supp ly side response According to Greg Conlin the President of the PUC when AB in CA was designed was a key part to the equation they spend litt le if any time discussing how this part of the puzzle never developed Th ey also give insuffucient explaination of the perse reasonablness clause There are other more specific instances I can send to you at a later ti me I left my notes on the document back in my office I can give you a summary early next week if thats OK I am currently

struck me The paper is not particularly accurate they make unsubstantiated claims of market power abuse they ign ore the lack of implementation of demandside response programs that were s upposed to be a integral part of the AB and they use inappropriate term s such as Idle when describing plants that were unavailable because of m aintenance or repair My reason for writing is to ask you how politically influential is a paper like this Are papers published by the CBO looked at as the authority on problems especially with those associated with the problems experienced in CA And if so

cant say no one told them dn Original Message Date pm Tuesday From AL ALEXANDERSON To IXGateWIZ CC DOUGLAS NICHOLS Subject RENew Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the billion shortage to sellers Were still trying to get Enron guidance on this Possibly wed rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution Im traveling with my cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list Sorry for the mixed signals al Howard J Weg PM I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues As you know I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible and to protect the interests of all members Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee

Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers The utility requests a day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September September is a Satur day Reply comments would be filed days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of approximately of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment period would last for days and commence days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over or undercommitment In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a reentry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a neart erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and reentry fee s should also apply There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings

Room August pm I Opening Comments Senator Debra Bowen Chairwoman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee Senator Bill Morrow ViceChairman Senate Energy Utilities Communications Committee II Panelists Stan Dirks California Department of Water Resources Chris Warner Pacific Gas Electric Gary Schoonyan Southern California Edison Jim Hay San Diego Gas Electric Mike Florio The Utility Reform Network Dave Morse Office of Ratepayer Advocates Dan Carroll California Industrial Users Douglas Heller Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Bill Julian California Public Utilities Commission BACKGROUND At the peak of Californias electricity crisis two of Californias investorowned utilities were financially unable to purchase electricity on behalf of their customers AB x Keeley Chapter Statutes of authorized the California Department of Water Resources DWR to begin buying power on behalf of the customers of those two utilities and San Diego Gas Electric ratepayers as well as to issue bonds to finance such purchases DWR wasnt authorized to utilize the credit of the state to back those purchases Instead it was authorized to recover the money needed to pay for its electricity purchases through electric rates charged to consumers and to perform is own reasonableness review of those costs The California Public Utilities Commissions CPUC discretion to perform a reasonableness review is rarely abrogated an exception being the costs of collective bargaining agreements but AB x made an exception in this case for two basic reasons First if the CPUC decided to preclude certain power costs from being passed along to ratepayers the effect would be to simply shift those costs from ratepayers to taxpayers Second the goal of a reasonableness review which is to create an incentive to do the best possible job on behalf of the ratepayers could be accomplished through DWR s accountability to ratepayers The theory was the political process would provide the check on DWRs activities much in the same way customers provide a check on the activities of a municipal utility To fulfill its obligations under AB x DWR spent billion through May That money was originally loaned from the General Fund In addition the state obtained a shortterm bank loan of billion to help pay for ongoing electricity purchases That shortterm loan the outstanding debt owed to the General Fund and the difference between actual electricity costs and electricity rates paid to DWR will all be financed through a billion bond offering which was authorized by SB x Burton Chapter Statutes of and may take place as early as October DWR has stated that the bond offering is contingent upon the CPUC taking a number of actions on August one of which is to approve the DWRconstructed Rate Agreement Agreement between DWR and the CPUC The Agreement provides the irrevocable contractual and enforceable assurance that the CPUC will allow DWRs electricity power purchase costs to be recovered in a timely manner Specifically the Agreement Creates a Rate Covenant where the CPUC acknowledges DWRs right to recover its selfdetermined revenue requirement as specified Defines DWRs revenue requirement to include the repayment of the bonds the cost of DWRs electricity procurement including the longterm contracts administrative consulting and legal costs and the cost of demand management programs Requires the CPUC to establish rates to allow recovery of DWRs revenue requirement within days or days as determined by DWR Authorizes DWR to take the CPUC to court to enforcement its provisions DWR has stated the Agreement is an essential element to obtaining the bond financing JP Morgan the senior managing underwriter for the DWR bonds has similarly stated that without the Agreement the bonds wont be viewed as investment grade quality thereby jeopardizing the bond issuance The Agreement is currently being considered by the CPUC A number of parties including small and large consumer groups who will be responsible for paying the rates along with the investorowned utilities have commented on DWRs proposed Agreement and raised a number of concerns The Treasurer has offered some suggested amendments to the Agreement to try and answer some of the concerns without impairing his ability to sell the bonds Issues Questions The Committee May Wish To Consider Must an Agreement be Signed AB x permits the CPUC to enter into a rate agreement with DWR but such an agreement is not required by the statute Given the irrevocable nature of DWRs proposed Agreement is it necessary for the CPUC to approve the agreement or will some other less binding agreement suffice One alternate approach to the Agreement is SB xx Burton which provides a dedicated rate to pay for the bonds and specifies exactly what DWR may include as a part of its costs SB xx passed the Senate on July and is pending at the Assembly desk Public Review DWRs revenue requirement at least as it pertains to power purchase costs bond repayment and associated administrative costs clearly isnt subject to CPUC review or adjustment pursuant to AB x Rather than have an independent party like the CPUC review its efforts AB x envisioned that public review and accountability would motivate DWR to do the best possible job to get the best value possible for ratepayers However the Agreement neither contemplates nor provides for public review which has raised concerns from a number of parties about what costs beyond the cost of buying power DWR is attempting to pass along to ratepayers as a part of the Agreement Scope of Revenue Requirement AB x specifically permits DWR to cover the cost of the bonds power purchases and associated administrative costs The Agreement submitted by DWR to the CPUC for adoption allows DWR to recover much more than those costs including the cost of demand management programs and legal consulting and technical services By including such costs in the Agreement these costs are subject to neither legislative nor public review The demand management programs have historically been the purview of the CPUC The California Independent System Operator has attempted this year to create and administer some of these programs with mixed success However DWR has no background in demand management and no public process for considering and approving such programs Given the lack of a public process and DWRs lack of expertise on demand management programs is it appropriate to allow DWR to include the unknown costs of these programs in the Agreement and Day Review The Agreement requires the CPUC to review and implement rates which allow DWR to recover its revenue requirement within days or days if DWR finds that an expedited change is necessary This is an extremely short window of time for the CPUC to analyze any DWR request and provide for full public review and comment Auditing DWRs revenue requirement will be tens of billions of dollars which will be paid for exclusively by the ratepayers of the states investorowned utilities Despite the fact that billions of dollars will be changing hands the Agreement fails to include an auditing requirement to ensure that appropriate revenues are provided to DWR that surplus revenues are returned to ratepayers and that there is ongoing monitoring of DWRs accounts Court Challenges The purpose of the rate agreement is to facilitate the issuance of the bonds to repay the General Fund and the shortterm loan Its possible that some party may challenge this Agreement or any of the other related CPUC decisions ie establishing the DWR revenue requirement creating a servicing agreement between DWR and the utilities etc in either federal or state court How will such a challenge effect the issuance of the bonds Contract Renegotiation The DWR contracts negotiated at the height of the energy crisis are viewed by some as expensive The state and ratepayers would certainly be better off if those contracts can be renegotiated based upon current circumstances The Agreement binds the CPUC to set rates sufficient for DWR to recover its revenue requirement including the cost of the contracts it has already signed Does the signing of this Agreement diminish DWRs ability or incentive to renegotiate any of the contracts Does it eliminate any incentive DWR has to negotiate the best possible price on any future contracts that it may sign since the costs of those contracts wont be subject to review or adjustment

from the meeting we had with SCE on August SCE said that it h as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesnt know what to charge for DWR Meanwhile it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR Once the CPUC decides on the DWRs revenue requirement SCE expects that it will charge generationrelat ed CTC again There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi ll return and goes beyond once QF contracts are above the market SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance on all these matters Once the CPUC rules on SCEs advice letter approache s SCE plans to go back and rebill begining with Jan it used some diff erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills going out June I didnt ask the question about calculating CTC back to Jan I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC they will bill it The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha ve a onehalf cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of cents ma king it about cents that collects the million that was uncollec ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc harge The half cent addition is for months Original Message From Curry Wanda Sent Friday August AM To Swain Steve Mellencamp Lisa Steffes James D Ruffer Mary Lyn ne Tribolet Michael Huddleson Diann Mara Susan Cc Gorny Vladimir Bradford William S Subject Summary or PX Credit Proposals I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday August th Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enrons exposure to PX credits Steve S wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal and his goal is t o have recommendations for EWSEES management on August th Current Issues The methodology for calculating PX credits after January is undeterm ined SCE and PGE have implemented different methodologies Applicability of the cent surcharge to direct access customers PGE is passing thru to DA customers SCE is not Impact to Enron if FERC implements retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct thru January th which result in revised PX credits Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for TD Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs CTC or other pass through charg es making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions Large uncollected receivables from both PGE and SCE The four proposals are as follows SCE Recommended Approach This approach assumes no PX or PE credit effective from January forward Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the gross PX receivable as billed by each utility which would be reversed This approach will ensure that only charges for TD no generationc ommodity costs CTC charges or surcharges for CDWR including the cent will be applicable to Direct Access customers Enron would request the following Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC SCE will support our historical PX credit receivable as an all owable claim at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p ossible PGE will support Enrons recoupment argument Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent level Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits if when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC Other consideration Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts PGE Recommended Approach This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu ary would include an avoided cost component This avoided cost component would include owned generation QF purchases actual CDW R purchases for the utility bilateral purchase contracts and ISO purchase s This resulting avoided cost would be used in lieu of the PX cle aring price in the old PX formula through March If the actual CDW R purchase costs are not included then the surcharge along with the embe dded gen costs should be included in the calculation Enron would request the following Same as above Other Consideration Enron would continue to be exposed to price risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March This would h amper Enrons ability to hedge the positions in the retail port folio Hybrid Approach This approach assumes that the PGE approach is applicable from Jan uary through September and that the SCE approach is applicable from September st forward This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa l Enron would request the following Same as SCE and PGE approach Other considerations Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio without concer n re CTC or other surcharge amounts Enron Model This approach assumes we continue to support a market based NP a nd SP calculation methodology for the PX credit Enron would request the following It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe r PGE and SCE The consensus from legal regulatory and EWS commercial is the probability of getting this approach approved is low Howev er understanding this amount at a minimum can be used to help defend the value Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti es and CPUC Other considerations This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge price risk b ut this is somewhat offset with incremental credit exposure associated wit h the actual collection of the PX credit Again please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu ded in Wednesdays meeting Thanks Wanda Curry

C Sent Friday September PM To Sharp Vicki Delainey David Cc Haedicke Mark E Whalley Greg Dietrich Janet Leff Dan Jim NRON Sanders Richard B Subject RE California AGs InvesigatorGray Davis Customer Contact We are considering four courses of action a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract a suit for an injuntion against the AG a letter of to our customers and a letter to the press from one of our customers California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday If California law does provide for such a waiver we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation Still if we can get evidence that the AGs investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors The letter would lay out the truth about the California energy crisis and DavisLockyers misguided and politicallymotivated search for a scapegoat We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashis statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was created in part by all arms of the California government to support our case We could also use published reports if verifiable about the DWRs imprudent purchases of power and cast the AGs investigation as an attempt to divert attention from DavisLockyers lack of any success in addressing the the crisis We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric and for continuing to be our business partners We would want this to be positive in tone A fourth response would be a letter from one or more of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AGs office This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers We are still thinking of other approaches We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest Please call

message ought to be delivered Im not optimistic there is time for the legislature to do anything else at this point If nothing else it would be good let the decision makers know that their plan may not have the hoped for result so they cant say no one told them dn Original Message Date pm Tuesday From AL ALEXANDERSON To IXGateWIZ CC DOUGLAS NICHOLS Subject RENew Unofficial Committee Contacting Decision Makers Doug and I have been debating wether there might be a broader Enron plan to support the legislation even with the billion shortage to sellers Were still trying to get Enron guidance on this Possibly wed rather have an expensive solution instead of no solution Im traveling with my cell phone all of tomorrow and Doug is working on Enron Central Please stand by in terms of adding our name to the agressive list Sorry for the mixed signals al Howard J Weg PM I have not heard back from all members of the Unofficial Committee regarding my email dated August with respect to the proposal to contact the Governor and Legislators regarding the pending legislation on SCE Some have suggested that the message needs to be stronger and others have suggested that the message is too strong Our Ex Officio members BPA and WAPA want it to be clear that they are not involved in any way with addressing the state government on this or other issues As you know I want very much to reach as broad of a consensus on this action as is possible and to protect the interests of all members Virtually all members agree that a bankruptcy case for or litigation against SCE would probably not be a good thing and we do not want to advocate for bankruptcy or litigation After all the Unofficial Committee was organized to provide a different approach generally The purpose of contacting the Governor and the Legislature is to let them know that the legislation they are now considering which leaves SCE about billion short on the proposed financing to pay creditors may cause some other sellers to take precipitous action in filing an involuntary petitition or initiating litigation or arbitration that could delay or prevent the financing at even the lower billion level which will adversly affect SCE and all creditors generally We should point out that not all sellers are in agreement on what action will be taken The message is not intended to threaten anything and it is not necessarily designed to stop legislation altogether only legislation that might actually make the situation worse for all sellers and SCE The tone of the presentation if we make one will be low key non threatening and in the spirit of helping the legislature and the Governor design a package that will avoid the bankruptcy litigation and other alternatives that others might be forced to consider if the bill is passed leaving the energy sellers out in the cold If there remain some members of the Committee that are not willing to be associated with the message outlined above then I propose that we give such members the alternative of remaining members of the Unofficial Committee and allowing us if asked to identify any such members that prefer not to be a part of the message although they want to support an approach that avoids litigation and bankruptcy for SCE I understand that the LADWP and Coral Power would like this approach adopted As I explained in my prior email it has been suggested that the proposed bill that leaves SCE short by a billion dollars will likely pass after Labor Day and before the Sept adjournment That is why timing is important Those of you that have not responed please respond Those of you that were concerned that the message was unclear please review this email and consider or reconsider your positions as the case may be As of right now there are only votes in favor and against The polls are still open so please let me know your position You should be aware that the City of Glendale notified me that it determined that actual or potential conflicts of interest with the Unofficial Committee required it to resign from the Unofficial Committee

Ackerman Ed Cazalet De nice Cazalet Purdum Curtis Kebler Curt Hatton Corby Gardiner Charles Mi essner Carolyn Baker Bill Ross Karen Shea Max Bulk Subject IMPORTANT Motion of San Diego Gas Electric Company U E for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or der Shortening Time Yesterday SDGE filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c omments on the mechanism The attached email from SDGE contains the motio n an executive summary and a detailed summary of their proposals and rec ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for SDGEs customers The utility requests a day comment period which me ans comments would have to be filed by September September is a Satur day Reply comments would be filed days later The filing provides the following discussion of direct access Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t o which they might be served instead by third party providers The level of direct access will affect these net short requirements At present there is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of an optimal plan This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over or under commi tments To resolve this uncertainty the Commission needs to coordinate dir ect access with resource planning at least on an interim basis SDGE disc usses below how to provide for this coordination As the retail market matures SDGE expects that direct access elections wi ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility That stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access and rely on them in developing a procurement plan However today direct access is subject to substantial uncertainty Before the high prices of the summer of approximately of SDGEs retail load had elected direc t access By the beginning of direct access had reduced by nearly hal f More recently SDGE has seen an increase in direct access perhaps as a result of two factors first would direct access customers be able to avo id paying a share of CDWR contract costs and second would the state suspe nd direct access as appears to be permitted under ABx Furthermore th e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access a nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load The effe ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access but it could cause larg e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce ss and resource planning The necessary coordination could come by using an open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect ions take place During that enrollment period the utility is provided inf ormation on the amount of load electing direct access or municipal aggrega tion and the length of the direct access commitment This open enrollment period would last for days and commence days before SDGE is schedul ed to submit its procurement plan Customers over kW would make commitmen ts to service by suppliers other than SDGE of at least years Smaller cu stomers would make minimum one year commitments These commitments and the use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDGE with the informatio n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of over or undercommitment In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers change of se rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan a nd to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers it could choose to l imit direct access Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c ustomers As a result of this change SDGE would not plan to provide commo dity service to departing customers Customers returning from direct access prematurely would be subject to a reentry fee and to spot energy pricing again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch Coordinating direct access with the planning process at least for a neart erm period is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role When the State embarked on industry restructuring one purpose was to take advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide Although C alifornias experience with markets has not been as anticipated it is stil l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers In fact some states hav e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers net short req uirements For example in parts of Pennsylvania the State decided to auct ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market Ca lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing If a portio n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner from a planning standpo int it should be treated the same as direct access SDGE will need adequa te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi tion remaining to be served and the same use of exit fees and reentry fee s should also apply There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up on as we have dealt with many of

what he said They plan to settle with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else which he reiterated would be sometime in Q Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utilitys undercollection and that the ESPs share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways lump sum netting ie if they owe MM and the share of the undercollection is MM then they pay the ESP MM or future reductions in PX Credit ie they pay the ESP MM and then reduce the PX going forward until the MM is paid down The numbers are illustrative only In addition he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR LT contracts and whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs I recommended strongly that he delink issues and above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC He agreed He said that the PUC judges recently issued prehearing conference order requires that Edison meet and confer with ESPs prior to the Nov th hearing and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing Fielder is also the point person on getting ESPs paid and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible at the expense of creditors to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago Edisons stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it We shouldnt assume

<8610006.1075859208104.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,d..steffes@enron.com,2001-11-15 06:48:13,RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT Cc Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond and may then apply for PGE I agree that if you were to go to a bottoms up it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs nongeneration for example QFs and a second surcharge for Negative CTC overpayment Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC overpayment On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim my concern is that to understand how much the overpayment was during Oct Feb we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period Otherwise we dont know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks Jim Original Message From Comnes Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Steffes James D Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT After the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit no So a customers CTC payments should not be affected by refunds If refunds are distributed prospectively we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PGEs expected refunds divide it by total load and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Wednesday November PM To Comnes Alan Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT Alan The only way to collect the overpayment is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC Jim Original Message From Comnes Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Steffes James D Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT I am not sure I understand your second paragraph If PGE reduces goingforward procurement costs to reflect FERCordered refunds I do not understand why it would affect alreadyissued CTC charges The cost of power would be cheaper going forward Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Wednesday November PM To Comnes Alan Dasovich Jeff Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Jan Paul Acton Email Swain Steve Mara Susan Cc Alvarez Ray Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT Thanks for the thoughts I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs I believe that you are right on Est RT CAISOM Imbalance but I need to check On the question of retroactive ratemaking it is my understanding that you are correct PGE probably wont rebill but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to collect the overpayment of Negative CTC All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than c on the for the Negative CTC Jim Original Message From Comnes Alan Sent Wednesday November PM To Steffes James D Dasovich Jeff Tribolet Michael Curry Wanda Mellencamp Lisa Jan Paul Acton Email Swain Steve Mara Susan Cc Alvarez Ray Subject RE PGE PX Credit Calculation CONFIDENTIAL ATTY CLIENT WORK PRODUCT I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable HC in the formula laid out in the attachment It is not clear to me which variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs but I assume its Est RT If I am right that variable would be affected by the mitigated market price MMP for CAISO imbalance energy My comments are The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and given appeals it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price MMP as declared by FERC and the PX credit That is a reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a effect on the PX credit assuming it can be recalculated at all Specifically only some of the HC or Est RT costs can be adjusted per FERC refund orders Also the PX credit is a tariffed rate I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account eg a balancing AC To my knowledge no such account exists here Finally I do not see a relationship between MMPs and block forward costs on any date and PGE andor DWRs procurement costs for the net short position post January So those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order Alan Comnes Original Message From Steffes James D Sent Wednesday November AM To Dasovich
