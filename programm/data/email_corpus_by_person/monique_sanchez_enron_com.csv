Subject FW spoke too soon Original Message From himex mailto Sent Thursday May AM To outhstreamcom Subject spoke too soon Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes quickly at meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and had i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends ensuring his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge now dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but stare into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives A member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp this morning Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i think of this mountain now i think only of death Russ is quite experienced in higaltitude rescues but this is the first time he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly strong Many stories of heroism over last hours and many to come The guide and the client spent the night on the ridge meters incoherent and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second time in hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes reaching top camp metersstill incredibly dangerous at pm It was a relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen moving space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could not stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above meters are epics and you are sure to read about this Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available bodies and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba and Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace and the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is inches across for stretches dropping feet on either side When i gazed down nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there for over hours now have been gathering oxygen for the meter descent to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a doublerescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back by mem daywe have to get these people down The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower and slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh oh Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile and nearly

get down i wonder what the results will be Its really sad I am sure they are also severely dehydratedill explain the process when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp was when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razorthin this whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a tenyearold knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here is that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line we used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or do you need even more because in truth you are dying from the moment you leave camp not even top camp I will pass this info only when the word is outsorrybut will keep you updated from there once i talk ro russ Its hard watching friends die but were helpless down here Get your

soon Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes quickly at meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead and dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late for the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and had i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends ensuring his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge now dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but stare into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives A member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp this morning Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i think of this mountain now i think only of death Russ is quite experienced in higaltitude rescues but this is the first time he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just incredibly strong Many stories of heroism over last hours and many to come The guide and the client spent the night on the ridge meters incoherent and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from a desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second time in hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes reaching top camp metersstill incredibly dangerous at pm It was a relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen moving space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could not stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above meters are epics and you are sure to read about this Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available bodies and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba and Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace and the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be an absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is inches across for stretches dropping feet on either side When i gazed down nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there for over hours now have been gathering oxygen for the meter descent to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a doublerescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back by mem daywe have to get these people down The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower and slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh oh Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and suddenly a

rules fyiAK Original Message From Bryon Sehlke Sent Friday September AM To Aaron Kozmetsky Chad Muir Subject FW some thought a little more on the radical side this was forwarded to me by Walt Cunningham who was an astronaut in the Gemini days hes on the texas aerospace commission with me Original Message From Walter Cunningham mailto Sent Wednesday September PM If we all did this our problem would be solved Walt The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit I send it on to you with the same invitation It offers some pretty good ideas My name is John Burnett I am a DC Captain for FedEx I am also a Police Officer for the Memphis Police Department My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions a pilot might consider when faced with a modernday hijacker These thoughts are outsidethebox when it comes to the way weve all been trained Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement them as a part of our normal training cycles They couldnt for fear of lawsuits I am distributing this via email to buddies Ive flown with Im asking them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry and for you to send it to yours I know most of us have email and I hope this reaches the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard We have all had training in what to do in case of a hijacking try to keep the hijacker calm make him think youre doing what he wants take him where ever he wants to go etc etc etc Save your passengers your crew and your aircraft In an emergency you will revert to that training When our unfortunate peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijackers demands to open the cockpit door their training probably made them open the door When the fanatics made demands their training told them to comply as best they could I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane what they thought as they descended over New York I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead bodies out of the cockpit But I bet they did as they were trained to do As you look back over recent hijackings FedEx and Egypt Air and now the September th hijackings you see a perpetrator who for one reason or another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself Each of these hijackers except for the FedEx incident were successful They took over the airplane and killed everyone onboard If youre following the news programs today you hear a lot about how we could let these hijackers learn to fly You would think if knowing how to fly would guarantee a successful hijacking Auburn Calloway the FedEx hijacker would have been a hijacker success story Calloway had been a Navy pilot a martial arts student a fellow FedEx crew member and he took all the weapons he needed hammers knives and a spear gun He didnt have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open the cockpit door He just went back to his bag took out his hammer came back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls The crew members on that flight didnt worry about Flight Attendants they didnt worry about passengers All three pilots left the cockpit and fought a handtohand lifeordeath battle To survive todays hijacker you cannot worry about your passengers you cannot worry about your Flight Attendants You must develop a mindset that everyone onboard including yourself is already dead Because if the hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane not only you your crew your passengers and your aircraft are lost but thousands on the ground are at risk One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived is the extraordinary actions of the copilot Although he had brain injury the copilot took the DC and immediately executed a halfroll This maneuver took the hijacker off his feet as the Captain and SO were struggling with him During a point in the maneuver the hijacker Captain and SO were thrown back behind the cockpit door When he righted the airplane the FO then left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane It was only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued he returned to the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing Very few of us have had to confront true evil Fewer still have seriously considered taking the life of another human being I believe this is the reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker The crews heroism that day is beyond belief And any action that leads to a safe landing and recovery cannot be argued with But when the Captain left the FO and SO thinking the situation was under control he was mistaken The FO and SO had sustained serious lifethreatening injuries The hijacker had not As the Captain flew the aircraft the hijacker who had surrendered began the fight anew As the airplane landed the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming the two crew members I mention this for your consideration I would suggest that you make a conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you Today we are at war The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is going to kill you and everyone onboard So how do you do that What weapons are available to us as pilots The intercom Command that all men come forward and fight with the hijackers You have many ablebodied men onboard They are sitting in shock not knowing what to do Command that they come forward and help you kill your attackers And they will come The airplane itself Get the hijackers off their feet Go into an immediate dive to float them to the ceiling Then execute a G positive maneuver and hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor galley shelf etc Pull the fire handles shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off If you lose the battle at least the airplane wont be used as a guided missile on a kamikaze mission With luck maybe these guys didnt learn how to do an inflight restart Then leave the cockpit all of you and kill your attackers dont believe it when they surrender dont be nice to them KILL THEM Flare Gun If your airplane has one the Captain might consider making sure its loaded and secured next to his bag I can think of nothing more satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a fanatics gut The crashaxe I would suggest you have your copilot take it from its holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available Makes an excellent skull crusher Your flashlight The FAA use to require a cell A cell MagLight makes an excellent weapon If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor writhing in pain crush their skulls Your stolen hotel bic pen Drive it into an attackers eye ear throat or into the area just under the jaw bone Thats a particular interesting place to drive it because when he opens his mouth to scream you can read Hyatt sticking there Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets Scoop the eyeballs out It will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes as they dangle there on the ocular nerves Your teeth Remember Hannibal Lecter Eat a nose a cheek or a finger And keep eating Attack with all viciousness A piranha is a small fish but its greatly feared A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with It will at least impress his buddies Now heres my wishlist of things the FAA could do to help especially in this time of war Arm the Captain The battle is not going to require any long shots A small revolver would be a good choice It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to disable your aircraft If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb Id shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the hijacker and his package would be sucked out And hey I if I got sucked out with him Id try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh at him all the way to the ground Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat Police are always looking for something free Donut shops use to be a favorite target for robbers until they started giving donuts to the Police Robbers dont rob donut shops anymore I would suggest each Police Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane Fill every vacant seat with armed Police give them a donut and tell them to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit Stop this silly noknife rule Make it public Tell the public theyre welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard Then everyone will bring them So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help youll have a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber tastes fanatics blood There are even a few of them whod want to keep the fanatics ears as souvenirs None of us is immune Take some time and consider your actions if this event should ever happen to you My prayer is none of you ever have to face this kind of decision Best of luck to you and may God Bless
