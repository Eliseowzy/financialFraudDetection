It was written by Morgan Staleys Chief Economist Saw One buck yesterday and one buck today Antlers arent worth talking about Original Message From Mike Callicrate mailto To News mailto Sent Friday September AM Subject Back to borders and hope for economic fairness less globalexploitation Copyright The Financial Times Limited Financial Times London September Friday London Edition SECTION COMMENT ANALYSIS Pg LENGTH words HEADLINE Back to borders The attacks of September will increase the costs of production and international trade As a result the world may start to turn its back on globalisation says Stephen Roach BYLINE By STEPHEN ROACH BODY The footprints of globalisation have left an obvious and important mark on the economic landscape during the past decade But the terrorist attacks of September and their aftermath may bring about its demise In the economic and financial sphere globalisation is all about enhanced crossborder connectivity Rapidly expanding trade and capital flows increasingly globalised supply chains and the rapid expansion of transnational activity of multinational corporations has made the world smaller place New information technologies have become the glue of globalisation making crossborder connectivity faster cheaper and increasingly frictionless Evidence of globalisation is unmistakable According to Morgan Stanley global trade rose to a record per cent of world gross domestic product in up from per cent in Transfers between foreign affiliates of multinationals surged by nearly twice as much as global trade did over the past decade Trade zones such as Nafta created new linkages between the industrial world and its offshore suppliers exports to the US account for per cent of Mexican GDP for example Asia excluding Japan has also become tightly linked to the US IT demand cycle close to per cent of the regions overall economic growth in can be accounted for by surging IT exports to the US In many ways the world was coming together as never before But the rules of the game have changed Terrorism puts sand in the gears of crossborder connectivity and the result threatens the increasingly frictionless world of globalisation The tragic events of September have in effect levied a new tax on such flows The security of national borders will now have to be tightened hardly a costless endeavour That will affect more than airports and shipping ports The porous borders of Canada and Mexico the conduits of increasingly seamless Nafta linkages will be tightened too As a result crossborder transfers will now cost more and take longer and insurance rates on such shipments will become considerably more expensive Moreover as the recent outbreak of the Nimda computer virus indicates it will no longer be possible to take instantaneous transfer of information and financial capital for granted Terrorist attacks also instil fear raising the risk premia of global connectivity Suddenly the brave new world looks a lot less seamless Basic economics says that a tax on crossborder connections should reduce the flow of such transactions In choosing offshore outsourcing versus domestic production the calculus of relative cost advantages may have been permanently changed But there is also a psychological dimension companies could start to look inwards The appetite for forging new crossborder alliances may diminish in an increasingly unstable world Risk aversion may take on evergreater importance There is another important dimension to this tax on globalisation It reflects the impact of a potential shift of national output away from productivityenhancing investments Productivity enhancement and globalisation have always gone hand in hand The surge of offshore outsourcing has been critical to newfound business efficiencies A tax on globalisation could change all of that It is not only the increments to business costs that might now arise from higher security shipping and insurance expenses It is also the potential ramifications of a shift in government spending back towards national defence reversing one of the more important trends of the postcold war era This peace dividend reduced defence spending as a proportion of US GDP from more than per cent to less than per cent during the past years At the margin reversal of this downtrend could crowd out private sector investment Productivity growth was set to decline over the next five years as the excesses were taken out of an ITinduced capitalspending expansion The costs of fighting global terrorism may take an additional toll A slowdown of trend productivity growth would then put concomitant pressure on corporate earning power and by inference on expected equity returns Investors could be in for a particularly rude awakening New alliances among governments are likely juxtaposed against the private sectors potentially diminished appetite for globalisation The worlds leading powers now seem to be coming together in an extraordinary fashion in the aftermath of the attacks United in the goal of combating global terrorism other grievances such as trade disputes are being put aside at least for the moment But these new alliances may backfire in one important respect They may drive an even greater wedge between the developed and the developing world Such a geopolitical wedge could reinforce longsimmering economic differences and increasingly isolate the developing world Widening income inequalities between the rich and the poor nations was an unmistakable hallmark of the th century According to research by the International Monetary Fund the richest per cent of the worlds population experienced a sixfold increase in real GDP per capita during the last century By contrast the lower quartile of world population enjoyed less than half that gain And these disparities are being exacerbated by the digital divide of the information age the contrast in economic opportunities between the computer literate and those lacking such skills These tensions do not speak well of the global village as an apt image of where globalisation is now headed The economic benefits of crossborder connectivity have long stood in sharp contrast with social disparities between rich and poor nations New political alliances that arise from a united front among rich nations against global terrorism may well compound this gap Such growing fragmentation means that the world may be turning its back on globalisation The recent cancellation of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington is particularly disappointing in this regard While both institutions have come under attack for mismanaging the process from time to time especially during the Asian crisis of these meetings offer a forum to probe the strengths and weakness of globalisation That opportunity will be sorely missed at this critical juncture in history This would not be the first setback for globalisation The integration of the Atlantic economy in the th century held out the promise of powerful convergence within Europe and between Europe and the US Yet this seemingly unstoppable trend gave rise to an equally powerful backlash brought about by the confluence of rising global income inequalities and political instability that played a role in sparking the first world war Yet another wave of globalisation occurred during the s only to be brought to an abrupt end by the Great Depression and a renewed outbreak of war The preconditions of these earlier backlashes widening global income disparities and mounting geopolitical tensions seem haunting today Not only does history tell us there is nothing inherently stable about globalisation but it also highlights globalisations tendency to sow the seeds of its own demise Sadly this time may be no different There is always a chance that we are making too much out of the implications of September But the global costs of escalating terrorism are unmistakable A new tax on the price of crossborder linkages is a big deal The same can be said of deepening political alliances in one powerful segment of the world The forces of globalisation which once seemed unstoppable are facing new resistance So too are the productivityled underpinnings of the US and world economy The playing field may be tilting before our eyes The

picked up by UPI Pretty cool man Bobby From Peter Roff To Peter Roff Subject Guest Commentary Now more than ever Date Thu Sep Guest Commentary Now more than ever By BOBBY EBERLE Special to UPI HOUSTON UPI After the Sept attack on New York and Washington there are some who have begun pushing more earnestly than ever for a missile defense system Others have scoffed asking How can a missile defense system stop an airplane from hitting a building Well guess what it cant In fact depending on how much notice is given for such an attack there is not much that can be done to stop an airplane from hitting a building Antiaircraft batteries on rooftops which were recently deployed in Moscow may or may not be effective But we are not helpless in the face of such attacks One way to stop airplanes from hitting buildings is to stop them being hijacked With the resources at our disposal there is no doubt that airports can be made much safer for travel But the attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon also reveal a deeper security need which extends beyond the necessity to stop airplanes from being hijacked These horrible terrorist attacks paint a clear picture of the need for a missile defense system America as a sovereign and free nation has an obligation to defend itself and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of her citizens This is a fundamental function of government something upon which liberals and conservatives easily agree In the face of danger whether from an aggressor nation or a group of religious extremists the United States must be able to defend itself using whatever means are necessary and appropriate for the situation at hand What is meant by necessary and appropriate Lets look at our current situation and construct a possible scenario The Bush administration orders the buildup of military personnel Plans are made to attack Afghanistan through bombing and ground assault in order to give the ruling Taliban regime no other choice but to give up suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden his lieutenants and end their support of terrorism The Taliban assemble their forces in an attempt to fend off the US attack Unsuccessful lacking other means of direct retaliation and subject to increased pressure from surrounding countries the Taliban deliver on Americas demands But this outcome is possible only if the nation being attacked lacks nuclear weapons What if the terrorist attack came from a nuclear power or one suspected of having that capability in the near future The options for the United States quickly become infinitely more complex Consider a fictional scenario in which the terrorist attack came from people within a country possessing nuclear weapons Terrorists attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon Intelligence sources suggest that the culprit has ties to Country X and is being sheltered there The US denounces the attacks calling them an act of war Negotiations to persuade the Country X to turn over the leader of the terrorist assault are opened At the same time the US prepares a plan of attack to apprehend the terrorists The negotiations fail The US begins bombing As a result fanatics seize control of the government of Country X The new leaders knowing their conventional forces are no match for the United States and believing that the United States and Israel are twin pillars of evil launch a nuclear missile at Israel What happens next is anyones guess There is an obvious question which should be asked when contemplating a retaliatory strike against potential enemies like North Korea Iran China How would the US react if attacked by conventional weapons from a nuclear state If we were to invade the consequences could include the destruction of New York Los Angeles or any other major metropolitan area in the US by a nuclear missile Are we prepared to take that risk in order to obtain justice Would we launch our own nuclear weapons If a strategic and theater missile defense system were in place the fictional scenario described above would likely have a completely different outcome Missiles launched against Israel or longrange missiles launched against the United States could be destroyed allowing US conventional forces to do the job they were ordered to do America cannot be held hostage by rogue states or unstable governments simply because they possess nuclear weapons The effectiveness of conventional military forces is greatly reduced if the United States is afraid to use them because of the potential consequences One threat against the United States and its allies who are now easy targets of any fanatic with a finger on the button can be virtually eliminated through an effective missile defense system We can give America a means by which its hands are not tied when it comes time to take action The best way to ensure that Americas conventional forces are feared is to render the enemies nuclear weapons ineffective We cant
