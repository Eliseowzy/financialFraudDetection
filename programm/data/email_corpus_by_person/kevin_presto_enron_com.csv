Forwarded by Paul J BroderickHOUECT on AM Craig Carmichael on PM To cc Subject Load Forecasting Technology To whom it may concern My name is Craig Carmichael I am a PhD student at Iowa State University working under Dr Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab Please lend me your attention for a brief moment Enrons team of power traders is the first contact I have made in this nature I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron millions in the very nearterm future If you are a power trader whose success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts then I believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you If I am way off base on my assessment please let me know and I will go somewhere else I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS Here are some of my credentials so that you can verify that it might be promising to read the remainder of this email Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning techniques Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the Chicago area for ComEd Saved ComEd millions of over the last couple years because of this Can verify the above claims and that I did this singlehandedly Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy Associates in Atlanta My software will be the new learning engine of NEAs NOSTRADAMUS future v Can verify that I singlehandedly wrote NOSTRADAMUSs new training engine not yet released Am the worlds best electric load forecaster using advanced inductive learning methods This is the situation I am giving my Final Defense on July th in areas of advanced forecasting methods In I developed highly advanced neural network models for Commonwealth Edison under Robert Abboud working at ComEd through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University The models were the most accurate available At the time ComEd was using the EPRI models NEAs Nostradamus Tesla and the ISU models those that I developed Still I knew of many ways for improvement and have been waiting for my graduation to release this technology Preliminary studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything that is available at any price Since I have felt oppressed by the system being a student I have awaited graduation am finished midJuly to unleash the technology that I have developed outside of the university my funding comes from the Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting This is unpublished provocative stateoftheart stuff that can smoke even the multimillion dollar EPRI models and only I know how they work The technology could also put Tesla out of business The errors appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he tried to merge his company with RGA Labs Robert Abboud from ComEd Excelon and now RGA Labs knows who I am Rick Hunt the project manager from New Energy Associates does also since I wrote the software for their yettobereleased inductive learning engine Ok Here are the possibilities I am making all of this up and didt really invent leading forecasting technology I am a nut who doesnt even know what hes talking about This guy couldnt possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock all by himself Maybe theres something to what this guy is saying We might as well send him a data set to test his claims I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I dont act now Within the next months someone will probably own my technology besides myself I want to prove that I can be an immense asset to Enron I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of your inhouse modeling efforts Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am making They might razzledazzle you with their marketing sense and ability to sell you their gem What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can do if you care about accuracy and not razzledazzle then I will not disappoint you Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and companies Let me show you that Im not making all of this up I will show you flaws in other gems I hope this email wasnt too long My family I as of now have a fairly uncertain financial future until I enter the workforce and have a fairly cushy job Because of this I am obligated to see what opportunities exist with my intellectual property If I fail in convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession then I will go to the spot on my list and will offer to provide them with the leading forecasting package available today In some way shape or form in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron Thank you for lending me your ear I hope you dont think Im a lunatic for sending you this lengthy email Craig Carmichael
