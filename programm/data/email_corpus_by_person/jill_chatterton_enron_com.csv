border dayahead electricity prices for delivery on the last day of January gained ground in the Golden State Traders noted that spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong I was surprised

course of the week and the latest sixtoten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures for the WSCC from February through In Enronrelated news Turnaround Expert Stephen Cooper was named interim CEO of bankrupt Enron Corp on Tuesday Cooper told Enron employees that their company was in much better shape than some of the hundreds of other companies he and his partners have represented

alleging that the defendants encouraged employees to buy Enron stock without being notified about the companys precarious financial condition Peak power prices in the Northwest fell by an average of

Correction in the Energy Market Report for January we incorrectly reported that CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett advised the commission to restore the direct access provision which was revoked September allowing industrial and household consumers to again chose their ESP through July In fact Barnetts ruling would retroactively cancel direct access from July onward nullifying contracts signed between July and September This is not a restoration of choice This is a postbirth abortion emailed one reader Additionally contracts penned before July but which didnt deliver power until after July are also cancelled under the new ruling To boil all this down to the simplest terms the DWR and the utilities are afraid that too much load switched to alternate suppliers during that time frame July through September Since they bought too much power through highpriced contracts they have fewer kilowatt hours to spread their costs against summed up one market analyst on the reason

Medical Examiner Joye Carter on Saturday Baxter was considered an important potential witness in the Enron affair after whistleblower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion with thenCEO Jeff Skilling about the companys dubious accounting practices A suicide note was found at the scene but the details of the note have not yet been released Equally serious are allegations made by Rep Henry Waxman of California indicating that the White House had apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically aided Enron Corp in India According to Rep Waxman the provision appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White House directly controlled the drafting The Bush Administration has understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political contributor denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron In related news GAO head David M Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VPs meetings with Enron representatives last year It would mark the first time the investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu sal to cooperate with an inquiry The Vice President insisted that the GAO was overstepping its bounds Their jurisdiction extends to agencies created by statute Thats

from fiveyear contracts at wholesale prices last summer to pay down the balancing account and thus benefiting SDGE rate payers while allocating the remaining million to shareholders The CPUC said they think the courts will award a higher number to the balancing account Californians may soon be allowed to choose their power provider again if CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett has his way The initiative a cornerstone of the deregulation bill was revoked September However consumers would have to hurry their selection as the option would be back in play for a limited time through July

energy costs in the West received a boost on Monday compliments of forecasts calling for belownormal temperatures increased generation curtailments and slightly higher natural gas prices The longawaited colder weather was likely to strengthen spot electricity prices over the coming days but opinions varied as to the extent and duration of the forecasted cooling The cold is finally coming here and temperatures should remain below normal for at least a week said one Northwest trader who added Im sure the dailies will react to this bullish weather pattern but theres so much gas in storage and water in the rivers that prices may not rise as much as some people are anticipating NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose Monday amid reported short covering but the gains were said to be limited by moderate weather forecasts for the eastern US and continued concerns surrounding high gas storage levels February Hub gas rose cents to close at mmBtu while March gained cents to settle

until EST Monday Enron and its attorneys would not comment on the reason for the delay Patience is a virtueisnt it Peak power prices in the Northwest were on the rise for Tuesday delivery a trend many players believed would continue through much of the week A round of colder weather was expected to increase heating demand in the region over the next several days According to Weather Derivatives heating demand in the region was expected to average percent of normal through January while the most recent sixtotenday forecast from the National Weather Service was predicting that belownormal temperatures would continue blanketing the Northwest through January Healthy flows at regional hydro generating units however had some parties convinced that the cold would come and go without

eliminating the Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority and the Electricity Oversight Board and to consolidate the duties of the Public Utilities Commission the Energy Commission the Department of Conservation and the energy division of the California Department of Water Resources Chamber of Commerce President Allan Zaremberg cited the many overlapping duties of these government entities as creating competition and conflicts of interest with the end result of inflating the states electricity costs while two of the entities are of dubious worth anyhow The newlyformed Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority has not done anything besides drain state resources since its inception in August and the Electricity Oversight Board has shrunk to a single board member in the absence of its primary duty to oversee the nowdefunct California Power Exchange Legislators vowed to untangle the web of conflict redundancy and inefficiency carefully to avoid causing an even bigger mess than the one they aim to repair Generation had a turbulent weekend with smallunit outages climbing by almost MW since Friday and Encina MW joining sister unit Encina MW in offline status

start of the new week as well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures were forecast to dip even further Some parties also claimed that a rise in the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily electricity market It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity market there was no volatility and no liquidity But next week could prove to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes said one marketer on Friday Following last Mondays auction for a percent ownership stake in the companys trading arm Enron Corp chose to have Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying but company lawyers said they will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on Monday The move was designed to restore market confidence in the onetime gas and electricity marketing giant Enron shares were suspended since the NYSE opened on Friday pending news on the deal Andersen the accounting firm for Enron remains in hot water following news that the firm violated one of the accounting professions basic auditing standards by destroying several Enron documents There are still many questions surrounding the destroyed documents including who shredded them when and exactly why The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm all for the sake of Enron Misery loves company Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as much as MWh for power to be delivered on Monday largely the result of forecasted cooling over the weekend which was likely to boost demand early in the new week Were going to drop back down to more seasonable temperatures over the weekend and that means well have more heating to contend with said one Northwest utility trader Light load goods rose by an average of MWh on the anticipated cooling and partly due to the

In unit news Colstrip MW was back on the grid Friday but Colstrip MW was brought down due to generator problems While no official ETR was available sources were hearing a January return at the

scheduled to shut on Saturday January for tube leak repairs While no official ETR was available conventional wisdom suggests a to hour turnaround Weather forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip to normal levels over the weekend while the latest sixtoten from the NWS was predicting a nearblanketing of belownormal temperatures across the entire region from January to Despite little change in temperature forecasts for Monday and weaker gas prices at the Socal border electricity prices for the SundayMonday package settled higher in the Golden State on Friday Sundays inclusion usually brings light load prices up but light load ran up more than I expected at the end maybe on the number of units off for the weekend and the colder weather anticipated in the new week said one California trader Onpeak power at SP traded between and MWh while offpeak deals were done from all the way up to MWh gaining more than MWh on the high end In unit news Etiwanda MW returned to the grid on Friday as did larger gas unit Pittsburg MW down since January for unplanned maintenance Offandon Moss Landing MW came down for unplanned maintenance while Encina MW exited for planned repairs Forecasts at midstate load centers called for temperatures in the to degree range on Monday about five degrees above normal for this time of year Los Angeles was

Southwest made their typical rise for SundayMonday power but some parties were surprised by the amount of strength seen Prices were up quite a bit which surprised me since spot gas was off slightly

Western peak power prices dipped slightly amid abundant Northwest hydro flows sluggish holiday demand and slightly lower spot gas prices A lot of schools and businesses are beginning to close for the

California border spot gas reportedly traded between to mmBtu down from Mondays range of to mmBtu NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts also slid Tuesday on ample storage but the decline was likely

Thursday December and then again on Thursday January In the political arena Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine proposed legislation on Tuesday requiring more diversification in pension plans to protect other US workers from the retirement savings fiasco that crippled many Enron Corp employees The two senators also called for a thorough investigation of the events leading up to Enrons collapse According to Reuters Boxer and Corzine said about of the assets in Enron k retirement plans were invested in Enron stock and they proposed limiting the investment an employee can have in any one stock in their k to percent No one who gives investment advice would ever recommend someone being invested at said Corzine at a news conference Their proposal also called for limiting the time an employer can force an employee to hold a matching employer stock contribution in the employees individual account plan to days That proposal would increase the tax liability of the employer

well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures were forecast to dip even further Some parties also claimed that a rise in the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily electricity market It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity market there was no volatility and no liquidity But next week could prove to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes said one marketer on Friday Following last Mondays auction for a percent ownership stake in the companys trading arm Enron Corp chose to have Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying but company lawyers said they will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on Monday The move was designed to restore market confidence in the onetime gas and electricity marketing giant Enron shares were suspended since the NYSE opened on Friday pending news on the deal Andersen the accounting firm for Enron remains in hot water following news that the firm violated one of the accounting professions basic auditing standards by destroying several Enron documents There are still many questions surrounding the destroyed documents including who shredded them when and exactly why The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm all for the sake of Enron Misery loves company Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as much as MWh for power to be delivered on Monday largely the result of forecasted cooling over the weekend which was likely to boost demand early in the new week Were going to drop back down to more seasonable temperatures over the weekend and that means well have more heating to contend with said one Northwest utility trader Light load goods rose by an average of MWh on the anticipated cooling and partly due to the inclusion of the allday

temperature forecasts for Monday and weaker gas prices at the Socal border electricity prices for the SundayMonday package settled higher in the Golden State on Friday Sundays inclusion usually brings

power prices for Thursday delivery were mostly lower across the West Wednesday on revised weather forecasts and lower spot gas prices On Tuesday some forecasts were calling for Arctic air to descend

are saying we will get some cooler air but not of the Arctic variety said one Northwest utility trader The revised forecasts also helped to lower balanceofthemonth contract costs at all of the major Western hubs I was shocked that the dailies and the balance traded lower today we were expecting at least a little upside after yesterdays session said one surprised marketer NYMEX Henry Hub gas

Wednesday coming in at kcfs through Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday kcfs Monday and kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday The lower flows partly reflected the return of cooler temperatures which have curtailed recent snowmelt reducing side flows in turn On the topic of water the Northwest River Forecast Center slightly lowered its runoff forecast for this year at some of the regions large Columbia

power prices in the Western US continued to fall Monday against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals While mild weather for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also lending a helping hand I dont know if prices can dip much below current levels but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on the margin and we could see some single digit prices said one marketer Temperatures were forecast to remain at abovenormal levels through the week with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to average only percent of normal through January though some cooling was expected next week Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the Northwest and California next week but temperatures are not expected to fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand said one Oregonbased trader who added And even if temperatures do fall considerably abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a minimum On the political front US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in US regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of onetime energy giant Enron Corp I think the dust hasnt cleared yet on this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its obligations under the existing rules said ONeill of the provisions that allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron stock in retirement plans could not If they did comply with US regulations it suggests that we need rule change If on the contrary it turns out that they didnt fully comply with all the rules we have a different issue on our hands ONeill said on NBC An auction of Enrons trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday though no details had been released as of this writing We hear that there are more than the two original suitors that will be bidding on Enron which is good news for Enron traders but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced so it may be a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining the company said one source Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as MWh on Monday as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies healthy Light load goods fell by an average of MWh It was a quiet day with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation said one Northwest utility trader There were some rumors that the MW gasfired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning but confirmation was not available It wouldnt make a bit of difference anyway said one trader of the possible outage Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were slightly lower than on Friday despite recent rains but remained healthy at kcfs through Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday and kcfs next Monday Weather forecasts called for abovenormal temperatures in Portland and Seattle over the course of the week while the latest sixtoten from the NWS was calling for belownormal temperatures across the entire region from January through The sixtoten offered some longs a glimmer of hope today but its too far off to rely upon and the current over abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold snap hypothesized one market pundit With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and plenty of supply flooding the electricity market power prices settled lower across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade Players speculated on where prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out However with no cold weather on the horizon most players were pessimistic of a quick turnaround Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro They probably wont but they could commented one California trader Onpeak goods at NP and SP traded mostly flat to each other between and MWh while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers with deals heard between and MWh Light load transactions were heard mostly in the to MWh range In generation news Moss Landing MW was operating at MW on Monday The Duke unit was

down possibly until the summer Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday with high temperatures expected in the mild mids to uppers The most current sixtoten called for belownormal temperatures along the coast and in Northern California with normal temperatures in the southern interior from January to Unseasonably mild weather lower spot gas prices and returning

power prices in the Western US rose slightly Tuesday on revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few days The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest where heating demand was forecast to climb to abovenormal levels by weeks end Theyve got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and thats what limited the upside but that also means theres less power available from the north so our prices went up a little as well said one Southern California utility trader Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder weather draws closer but most expected the upside to be limited due to the abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices In other industry news Weil Gotshal Manges the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron reported Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron Corps energy trading business Weil plans to announce the winning bidder at its New York offices Thursday and then present the

bidders were to remain confidential it was reported that Citicorp Inc and UBS Warburg were among the suitors though a third financial institution that had previously expressed interest JP Morgan Chase Co declined to submit a bid by Mondays nights deadline British company BP Plc also said it may be interested in the operations and had submitted a bid of million for a small portion of Enrons assets including some back office functions and some IT assets Enrons lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids but rather an ownership stake of up to percent Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of MWh for Wednesday delivery Cooler weather forecasts were nearuniversally blamed for the rising dailies though most players conceded that healthy river flows would limit the upside The colder weather is a small blessing for sellers but also for the region as a whole The recent warm weather has caused some snowmelt something few people want to see until the spring and the lower temperatures should put a stop to that said one Northwest trader According to Weather Derivatives heating demand in the region was expected to average percent of normal Wednesday and then rise to a peak of percent of normal by Sunday Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed from a day ago coming in at kcfs through Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday and back up to kcfs next Monday and Tuesday Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather dayahead electricity prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday Gains were modest on the order of a dollar

the FERC judge for the California refund case said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July and submit his proposal to FERC by early August The state accuses energy companies of overcharging

just not a lot of motivation to buy or sell he added Offpeak power firmed up slightly across the entire WSCC likely due to increased overnight heating demand some analysts ventured Other likely

important details which would have better shielded California in the event of failure by the supplier to deliver the power or in times of excess demand The contracts were negotiated in a matter of weeks rather than the usual months and tied Californians into paying more than double the current spot prices for electricity for the next decade Oscar Hidalgo spokesman for the team of buyers at the DWR defended the DWRs performance saying The lights are on the costs are way down stability is back in the market The longterm contracts are a big part of it However the Bureaus report noted that the state likely bought too much electricity and as a result will have to sell much of its power during times of low demand at a loss on the spot market This alone could cost consumers as much as billion over the next decade At the same time the contracts do not include many commitments from peaker intermittent loadcontingent plants which would make the state once again vulnerable to price spikes at times of peak demand In unit news gasfired Contra Costa MW slipped back onto the grid after a oneday maintenance outage Encina MW also began ramping up on Friday and was at MW by PST Temperatures were

bucked the trend on Friday Marketers were restless and eager to either cover their meager loads or divest themselves of their excess energy and then head home for the holidays There was not a lot of

fell sharply throughout the West on Thursday The most notable declines were seen in the southern half of the WSCC as temperatures remained at or just above normal levels while much of the Northwest and Northern California combated increasing heating demand Lower spot gas prices may have played a role in softening the dailies but holiday loads are the main marketmoving force admitted one trader NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose Thursday on forecasts calling for endofthemonth cold in the Midwest and Northeast though most players believed that weak holiday demand would limit the upside in the near term January Hub gas which expires next Thursday rose cents to close at mmBtu and February gained cents to end at mmBtu The forecasted cold for the eastern half of the US may well have pushed Henry Hub prices much higher had it not been for the glut of gas currently in storage said one gas watcher Over the past several weeks the Western US has led the nation in inventory withdrawls largely due to colder weather in the region relative to the rest of the nation Several sources indicated that the strong Western draws were due in part to a large number of unit outages especially at coalfired plants which increased the demand for natural gas The recent return of more than MW of coalfired generation however will likely reduce demand for natural gas going forward Natural gas demand will likely be reduced further by the recent precipitation Not only does the heavy precipitation lend to stronger hydro generation now but higher snowpack will likely boost hydro output when the spring runoff takes place All these factors lead me to believe that the demand for gasfired generation in the West will remain weak well into said one market analyst Heavy load energy costs for Christmas Eve delivery fell by an average of MWh in the Northwest on Thursday but the decline was limited by colder temperatures across much of the region Peak power at the MidColumbia traded in a relatively narrow range from to MWh while light load goods for the allday Sundayoffpeak Christmas Eve package were seen in an even tighter range between and MWh Im not sure why they treated Christmas Eve as a peak power day I dont know anyone who will be working on Monday said one baffled trader Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained strong amid recent heavy precipitation coming in at kcfs Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday kcfs Christmas Eve kcfs Christmas Day and kcfs next Wednesday and Thursday Recent heavy rains have all but quashed a yearlong drought in the region With the shortest day of the year upon us Portland Oregon was enjoying its nd day of continuous rain That leaves only three more days of Mother Natures revenge to break the record of days Precipitation since October has ranged from to of normal in the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada Mountains Canadian precipitation is back on track too with snowpack levels in the Columbia River drainage at or above normal Last years drought frigid weather and market panic are merely distant memories Peak power prices for the SundayMonday package weakened across the Golden State on Thursday in what marketers described as a cold wet uneventful trading day The allday Sundayoffpeak Monday piece lost ground at every California hub with SP the biggest mover Theres just no demand over the holidays especially with this mild weather lamented one overstocked seller Abovenormal precipitation and temperatures in the low s to mids were the mostoft cited targets for blame according to market players The fiveday forecast called for temperatures in the western portions of California to be near or slightly below normal while the eastern portions were expected to be slightly above normal Rain was predicted for the coastal and lowland regions with snow called for in the mountains The latest sixtoten suggested that temperatures would fall below normal from December to In unit news gasburner Los Medanos MW had already powered up to MW following an unplanned outage and Contra Costa MW was ramping down for a planned maintenance outage It had powered down to MW as of the CAISOs report Relatively mild weather and meek holiday demand prompted spot electricity prices in the Southwest to make the sharpest declines in the West on Thursday Peak power for Christmas Eve fell by as much as a whopping MWh at Palo Verde with confirmed trades heard anywhere between and MWh A very late trade reported at MWh was no more than an anomaly Light load goods at the Southwest hub traded narrowly between and MWh In unit

Day Other factors helping to push the dailies lower were abundant Northwest hydropower and slightly lower spot gas prices Between now and the new year many traders will be out of the office and loads will remain at holiday levels so we dont expect much movement or activity until barring any sustained cold or unit outages of course said one marketer While no one can predict the stability of generating units forecasters predicted mostly normal and abovenormal temperatures for the entire West through the end of the month NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts for the front months rose early on endofDecember forecasts calling for belownormal temperatures in the Midwest and Eastern US but fell late after another bearish AGA report to finish the day in negative territory January Hub gas shed cents to settle at mmBtu while February fell cents to close at mmBtu Wednesdays AGA inventory report delayed more than minutes due to a computer problem indicated that US gas stock fell bcf last week

However opinions varied as to whether or not this trend would continue through the winter months In other industry news FERC on Wednesday raised its wholesale electricity price cap for the Western states to MWh up from the previous cap of MWh The increase in effect through April was implemented as a precaution in case of strong demand in the Pacific Northwest this winter The cap is tied to the regions natural gas market which means it could be recalculated if natural gas prices change dramatically FERC said Western traders voiced little enthusiasm about the new order With an overabundance of hydro generation and the inclusion of Saturday in the threeday package both on peak and offpeak prices across the Golden State dipped considerably on Wednesday With a rainstorm looming off the California coast prices had nowhere to go but down commented a Western player Peak power at NP was heard trading between and MWh shedding a whopping and MWh at the high and low ends respectively According to a CAISO spokesperson FERC was expected to issue an order on Wednesday that would among other things ask the CAISO to submit by May a proposal for redesigning the California market including the creation of a dayahead market The CAISO dayahead market would likely be an extension of their current realtime market as opposed to a daily auction such as the one held by the former CalPX In other news FERC reopened the inquiry into whether or not El Paso Corp which owns and operates four pipelines into California manipulated the California market during the supply shortages last winter Lastly SCE told the CPUC that Enrons service to its California customers was deteriorating and the utility urged the commission to decide on an alternate supplier if Enron fails to meet its obligations On the generation front there was an additional MW offline in the CAISO control area Wednesday in comparison to a day ago Gasfired Moss Landing MW was offline Wednesday with no available ETR while Los Medanos MW was operating at MW or of capacity Although an official ETR was unavailable rumors circulated that Sutter Plants MW would not be back until December at the earliest SONGS MW
