Message From Corman Shelley Sent Monday October PM To Hartsoe Joe Butler Janet Subject Partial Day Recall Filing UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEFORE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION Regulation of ShortTerm Natural Docket No RM Gas Transportation Services Regulation of Interstate Natural Docket No RM Gas Transportation Services MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES Pursuant to the March Notice of Petition in the abovereferenced proceedings and Rules and of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions Commission regulations CFR and the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March Petition of the American Gas Association AGA Petition I All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to Shelley A Corman Vice President Government Affairs and Public Relations Enron Transportation Services Company Smith Street PO Box Houston TX Phone Email Nancy E Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager Government Affairs Washington DC Phone Email II MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act In some cases these pipelines are whollyowned subsidiaries in other cases Enron is a part owner These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party Thus the Enron Interstate Pipelines participation is in the public interest III COMMENTS The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein Like INGAA the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition First the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No proceedings or GISB compliance filings Second the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the farreaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates Rather than repeat those concerns again here we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights For the reasons set forth in both INGAAs response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition December To Gas Industry Standards Board From Pipeline Segment Re Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items and and R At the scheduled December GISB Executive Committee meeting the agenda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementation of Order No requirements and related standards such as R Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partialday recalls Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the farreaching impact of flowing day recalls There are significant operational concerns with these standards We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow particularly during critical periods We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid Given these operational concerns we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards While we understand that this work is in response to R we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No Order No requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day Further most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability In the spirit of compromise we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases However under these revised standards all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported Nonetheless throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards In this area we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls it still preserves the application of the fullday contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers Flowing day recalls though are a separate issue Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems overruns imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards Any move from daily increments of service to partialday increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system including firm services interruptible services and balancing and operational provisions Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation April Mr David Boergers Secretary Federal Energy Regulatory Commission First Street NE Office of the Secretary Room A East Washington D C Re Docket No RM Docket No RM Dear Mr Boergers Enclosed for filing with the Commission in the
