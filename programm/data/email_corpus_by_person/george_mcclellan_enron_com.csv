idea of Paul McPhee taking over as the resident director of ECAP As you would remember the only reason I had the role was the need for a resident to have the role and issues at the time with the only qualifier on the desk Clearly it will be far efficient for all involved to have someone closer to the business in the role and also a better control as he will be far more familiar with the deals
