Beth Pearlman I believe there was a lot of good information exchanged and that is why we ran so late I certainly came away with a different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron I need to make some things are very clear in our go forward strategy At the end of the day the account team Dave Spurlin up through Jeff myself and Jerry own the responsibility for the Enron relationship If corporate folks are making deals with Enron we still have to manage the account Peter Blackmore is very clear about that He was always preserved the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are taking place within Enron He isnt the decision maker on deals like the EBS one but as you are well aware of the EBS contract has impaired other business opportunities within Enron Daves sole responsibility is Enron and making sure that your needs are being met He will direct and assist in making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the relationship with Enron I need your help with all Enron organizations to make sure that they use Dave as the focal point If folks continue to go around him situations like EBS will continue He has to have the total picture of business transactions happening at Enron He will understand how those situations can impact the business at and for Enron Secondly attached is the information that I received regarding contracts with Enron Regarding the PowerGas contact it is a year deal with the sixth year being optional The annual outlay is estimated to be M per year I did make an error in using the M divided years versus years So at years the value is M If you have something different lets make sure that we are on the same page I have attached the emails that I received this data from RE Enron Energy Management Contract Update RE Enron Building Services Novi MI Regarding the EBS deal from a business perspective we need to do a level set very quickly Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive light Compaq will honor its commitments but we need to make sure that Enron does the same The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of expectations relative to Compaqs revenue from EBS versus what actually got booked Our expectations were M a year based on the forecast provided by EBS certainly not M based on what we agreed to yesterday I find it very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held accountable for our portion of the deal when we dont have the revenue to off set it Based on what I have heard both parties had shortcomings based on expectations that were set I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to see how it was left I also need to get your perspective on the transaction Jennifer if there is a business opportunity Compaq certainly wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron Provided its equitable for both sides I realized that this is a difficult situation but we will get through it Jennifer once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and hosting Compaq I will contact you later today Thanks
