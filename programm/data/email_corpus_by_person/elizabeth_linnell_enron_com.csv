Richard Cc McMahon Greg Terraso Michael Linnell Elizabeth Subject RE EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Richard thanks for the below Apologies for not getting back to you sooner Budget meetings are taking up a considerable amount of time We are having the RA meeting this Thursday and have put this on the agenda of things to discuss Once discussed I will get back to you with our views thanks Stephen x Original Message From Dernehl Ginger On Behalf Of Shapiro Richard Sent October To Wood Stephen Cc McMahon Greg Terraso Michael Linnell Elizabeth Subject FW EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Stephen Were trying to work out how certain allocations from Corp are applied within Enron Europe Currently the allocations in question are being applied to Regulatory Affairs Europe RA I received a message from Greg McMahon regarding the Environment and the Environmental Policy and Compliance cost centers distribution to RA but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center Managing Dir Govt Affairs to RA I think all of these cost allocations should be at the Enron Europe level as a company rather than distributed to the RA group Regarding the Environmental groups allocations these activities are on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA At least part of the activities are global in nature and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within Europe Regarding the Mng Dir Govt Affairs allocation these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our DC office with federal legislators and agencies again on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA Another issue with the distribution of these costs to RA is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated Please let me know your thoughts on this issue Kind regards Richard Shapiro Original Message From McMahon Greg Sent Friday October AM To Linnell Elizabeth Cc Wood Stephen Subject RE EHS Corporate Allocations Plan thanks for the call Elizabeth I spoke to Stephen as he produces the reporting we do on corporate allocations He does not think Bob would be able to resolve it or want to get involved Can you please ask Rick to forward it to Stephen and hell resolve it We have our Reg Affairs budget meeting with Michael Brown next week and he is sure to have some views on it Stephen the issue is that the Corp allocations Reg affairs are getting are for EHS work and general rather than specifically attributable to Reg affairs Its k Elizabeth Ill send you a copy of the budget as soon as Paul Dawson as agreed it probably monday next week thanks Greg Original Message From Linnell Elizabeth Sent October To McMahon Greg Subject FW EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Greg Corp Finance gave me Bob Spargers name as a potential decision maker on this issue Per my voicemail I just wanted to give you a heads up that Rick will be sending him a note regarding these issues Well copy him on the messages to bring him up to speed on the history and will include an updated explanation of the EHS charges also attached here Please let me know if theres anyone else with whom we should be communicating to resolve the issue Thanks

international meetings coordination of Enron global climate change position evolution providing requested information regarding the structure of emission trading markets and greenhouse gas markets Original Message From Linnell Elizabeth Sent Wednesday October PM To McMahon Greg Cc Stringer Alan Dawson Paul Shapiro Richard Wood Stephen Terraso Michael Subject RE EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Greg Aside from the justification of the EHS allocations to Europe the larger question is where those charges should be applied Rick and I spoke yesterday about this and we agreed that the EHS charges as well as the small amount of Corp Govt Affairs thats allocated to Europe are more appropriately applied at the business unit level as its not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services Additionally the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway so its rather like burying allocations within another allocation Ive left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp Finance group to find out who we need to talk to in Europe about this issue If you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this Id appreciate that as well In the meantime well be sure to update the allocation explanations for the two EHS departments concerned Thanks Elizabeth Original Message From McMahon Greg Sent Wednesday October PM To Linnell Elizabeth Cc Stringer Alan Dawson Paul Shapiro Richard Wood Stephen Subject EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Elizabeth Thanks for your reply I think we need to revisit the issue you were a great help last year and I think we understand the allocations more than we ever did Ive attached the spreadsheet we received and have pulled our figures from I think it is from Dawn Derr File Corp Allocationsxls Paul has asked me to write the email in the hope that between us all we can agree if the charges are valid or can be reducedremoved Alan I have copied you in as Paul mentioned you were the most appropriate EHS

Judge Paul Davis a Democrat release d his ruling in the Texas congressional redistricting case The plan he d elivered was an apparent surprising victory for Republicans accomplishing most of the

other is a long the border between El Paso and Laredo Henry Bonillas RSan Anton io district has been drawn into the Hill Country and Central Texas Lo ok for former Texas Secretary of State Henry

vulnerable The preliminary read is that if this plan stands up and it looks pretty solid on votingrights grounds Republicans will pick up at least two s eats and more likely somewhere between four and six That would mean the Texas delegation goes from in the Democrats favor to GOP sea ts of the total with added this year and makes it more likely the G OP retains control of Congress in Craig Craig Casselberry Quorum Direct Inc Political Issue Communications for Business Congress Avenue Suite Austin TX P F Texas Democrats Suffer Setback By Thomas B Edsall Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday October Page A A Texas state judge has ordered new con gressional districts to be drawn that would likely end the House career of Democrat Ken Bentsen and would threaten the reelection of at least four o ther Democrats Charles W Stenholm Jim Turner Max Sandlin and Chet Edwa rdsThe ruling is a devastating blow to the national Democratic goal of sta ying even with the GOP in the congressional redistricting process and winn ing control of the House next year Republicans contend that the judicial plan keeps them on track to pick up as many seats nationwideWhat real ly hurt us in Texas is that a Democratic judge made the ruling said a De mocrat involved in the process In private aides to Rep Martin Frost D Tex the principal architect of his partys redistricting strategy in Tex as and nationally had said that the assignment of Judge Paul Davis to the case increased the likelihood that Democrats would get a positive decisio nYesterday Frost issued a statment claiming confidence that the Texas d elegations Democratic majority would be reelected under the map but he a lso made clear that there would be a legal challenge The map adopted tod ay would divide several Hispanic and African American communities to dilut e their voting strength in likely violation of the Voting Rights Act It eviscerates many existing districts where minority communities elect the candidates they choose to represent their interestsDemocrats now fac e the more daunting task of trying to persuade an East Texas federal court to accept more proDemocratic lines Republicans contended that the Davis map which has priority in court proceedings would conservatively produc e at least three new GOP seats including the two new seats added to the delegation because of the states population increase in the censusT he current Texas delegation has Democrats and Republicans With the addition of two new seats Republicans contended that after they wil l have at least an even delegation and perhaps as much as an to advantage depending on a number of factors including President Bush s popularity in November An aide to Bentsen acknowledged that we got the short straw on this one Bentsen would be forced to run against fell ow Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee who is black in an overwhelmingly minorit y district Bentsen may now give stronger consideration to running for the Senate seat from which Phil Gramm R will be retiringStenholm who has been able to win in GOPleaning counties said he is prepared to run and w in whatever the district lines areWhile partisans on both sides expect the majority of states redistricting plans to end up in court Republicans h ave contended that they will emerge from the process with a net gain of ei ght to seats Democrats have contended that the process will be a wash with neither party coming out aheadJust last week Democrats won what is likely to be their biggest victory in the process creating seven district s in Georgia with Democratic

the larger question is where those charges should be applied Rick and I spoke yesterday about this and we agreed that the EHS charges as well as the small amount of Corp Govt Affairs thats allocated to Europe are more appropriately applied at the business unit level as its not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services Additionally the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway so its rather like burying allocations within another allocation Ive left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp Finance group to find out who we need to talk

Shapiro Richard Subject FW EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Rick For you to send to Stephen Wood Please copy me Greg McMahon and Mike Terraso Thanks Stephen Were trying to work out how certain allocations from Corp are applied within Enron Europe Currently the allocations in question are being applied to Regulatory Affairs Europe RA I received a message from Greg McMahon regarding the Environment and the Environmental Policy and Compliance cost centers distribution to RA but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center Managing Dir Govt Affairs to RA I think all of these cost allocations should be at the Enron Europe level as a company rather than distributed to the RA group Regarding the Environmental groups allocations these activities are on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA At least part of the activities are global in nature and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within Europe Regarding the Mng Dir Govt Affairs allocation these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our DC office with federal legislators and agencies again on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA Another issue with the distribution of these costs to RA is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated Please let me know your thoughts on this issue Kind regards

resolve it We have our Reg Affairs budget meeting with Michael Brown next week and he is sure to have some views on it Stephen the issue is that the Corp allocations Reg affairs are getting are for

the larger question is where those charges should be applied Rick and I spoke yesterday about this and we agreed that the EHS charges as well as the small amount of Corp Govt Affairs thats allocated to Europe are more appropriately applied at the business unit level as its not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services Additionally the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway so its rather like burying allocations within another allocation Ive left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp Finance group to find out who we need to talk to in Europe about this issue If you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this Id appreciate that as well In the meantime well be sure to update the allocation explanations for

Shapiro Richard Subject FW EHS Corporate Allocations Plan Rick For you to send to Stephen Wood Please copy me Greg McMahon and Mike Terraso Thanks Stephen Were trying to work out how certain allocations from Corp are applied within Enron Europe Currently the allocations in question are being applied to Regulatory Affairs Europe RA I received a message from Greg McMahon regarding the Environment and the Environmental Policy and Compliance cost centers distribution to RA but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center Managing Dir Govt Affairs to RA I think all of these cost allocations should be at the Enron Europe level as a company rather than distributed to the RA group Regarding the Environmental groups allocations these activities are on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA At least part of the activities are global in nature and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within Europe Regarding the Mng Dir Govt Affairs allocation these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our DC office with federal legislators and agencies again on behalf of the business units activities not on behalf of RA Another issue with the distribution of these costs to RA is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated Please let me know your thoughts on this issue Kind regards

write the email in the hope that between us all we can agree if the charges are valid or can be reducedremoved Alan I have copied you in as Paul mentioned you were the most appropriate EHS person and if Reg Affairs dont take the charges perhaps your department Asset Management can These are the EHS charges Reg Affairs are down to take at the moment From the spreadsheet I could work out that we are paying for Environment and of Policy and Compliance total budgets The costs are not large but we are being made to explain all Corporate Allocations to our COO this year in length as to the value we get and what we use it for of budget Government Affairs Environment k k Susan Warthen Environmental Policy Compliance k k Jeffrey Keeler Total k k Rick Paul Alan Id appreciate any comments from you as well as Stephen is expecting me to reach a resolution on this Thanks a lot Greg Here is the description I have of each of the two areas in I think I received them both from you Environment My groups support services are more global in nature rather than providing services to any one unit Services include the administration of the corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions risk assessment of acquisitions divestitures major capital projects corprate responsibility initiatives performance reporting I divided the business unit allocations based on business growth maturity of their EHS management systems and historical use Environmental Policy and Compliance Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated use of our groups time for FY revised dollar amount of As directed by Mike Terraso and Steve Kean we expect to increase our commercial support focus in towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets and will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area We expect our current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global markets including Providing competitive intelligence timely information and analysis to commercial units based on environmental policyregulation in Europe and worldwide Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and identify business opportunities related to environmental policies Subjects include Global Climate Change carbon dioxidegreenhouse gas emission regulation Air quality regulation SOAcid Rain NOx mercury particulate matter Renewable Energy Energy Efficiency renewable mandates

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide working closely with government affairs public affairs units Maintain ongoing relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective coalitions with industry organizations NGOs and other stakeholders on behalf of Enron businesses Original Message From Linnell Elizabeth Sent September To Wood Doug Cc Dawson Paul Wood Stephen McMahon Greg Shapiro Richard Terraso Michael Subject FW Corpoorate Allocations Plan Doug We had similar questions raised in I believe by Stephen Greg and Peter Styles Without seeing the spreadsheet that outlines your numbers I think the issue is in how Enron Europe distributes the allocation the business unit received from Corp I recall that last year for the issue boiled down to how Europe handled the EHS costs which are separate from Govt Affairs but I dont have a record of what resolution was reached Would a similar resolution be in order for or do we need to revisit the issue Im happy to help out from the Houston end Regards Elizabeth

forcibly retired Congressmen Frost Sandl in Turner Granger Stenholm face challenges More and Washington Post article Texas Democrats Suffer Setback att ached below Late yesterday Austin State District Judge Paul Davis a Democrat release d his ruling in the Texas congressional redistricting case The plan he d elivered was an apparent surprising victory for Republicans accomplishing most of the objectives sought through their own proposals Initial observations One of the two new seats is in the coastal bend region between Corpus C hristi and Houston extending north toward the Austin area The other is a long the border between El Paso and Laredo Henry Bonillas RSan Anton io district has been drawn into the Hill Country and Central Texas Lo ok for former Texas Secretary of State Henry Cuellar who just resigned t his week to run in that district rather than challenge Bonilla as has been speculated Ken Bentsen DHouston was drawn into Sheila JacksonLees DHouston district Thats the only pairing Gene Green DHouston was drawn out of his district which becomes Hispanic and into a nearly Republican district Max Sandlin DMarshall gets all of Tyler and Longview Republican vot es Jim

utting all three in BIG trouble Martin Frosts DDallas district becomes about points more Repub lican making him vulnerable Kay Grangers RFort Worth district becomes points more Democrati c making her vulnerable The preliminary read is that if this plan stands up and it looks pretty solid on votingrights grounds Republicans will pick up at least two s eats and more likely somewhere between four and six That would mean the Texas delegation goes from in the Democrats favor to GOP sea ts of the total with added this year and makes it more likely the G OP retains control of Congress in Craig Craig Casselberry Quorum Direct Inc Political Issue Communications for Business Congress Avenue Suite Austin TX P F Texas Democrats Suffer Setback By Thomas B Edsall Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday October Page A A Texas state judge has ordered new con gressional districts to be drawn that would likely end the House career of Democrat Ken Bentsen and would threaten the reelection of at least four o ther Democrats Charles W Stenholm Jim Turner Max Sandlin and Chet Edwa rdsThe ruling is a devastating blow to the national Democratic goal of sta ying even with the GOP in the congressional redistricting process and winn ing control of the House next year Republicans contend that the judicial plan keeps them on track to pick up as many seats nationwideWhat real ly hurt us in Texas is that a Democratic judge made the ruling said a De mocrat involved in the process In private aides to Rep Martin Frost D Tex the principal architect of his partys redistricting strategy in Tex as and nationally had said that the assignment of Judge Paul Davis to the case increased the likelihood that Democrats would get a positive decisio nYesterday Frost issued a statment claiming confidence that the Texas d elegations Democratic majority would be reelected under the map but he a lso made clear that there would be a legal challenge The map adopted tod ay would divide several Hispanic and African American communities to dilut e their voting strength in likely violation of the Voting Rights Act It eviscerates many existing districts where minority communities elect the candidates they choose to represent their interestsDemocrats now fac e the more daunting task of trying to persuade an East Texas federal court to accept more proDemocratic lines Republicans contended that the Davis map which has priority in court proceedings would conservatively produc e at least three new GOP seats including the two new seats added to the delegation because of the states population increase in the censusT he current Texas delegation has Democrats and Republicans With the addition of two new seats Republicans contended that after they wil l have at least an even delegation and perhaps as much as an to advantage depending on a number of factors including President Bush s popularity in November An aide to Bentsen acknowledged that we got the short straw on this one Bentsen would be forced to run against fell ow Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee who is black in an overwhelmingly minorit y district Bentsen may now give stronger consideration to running for the Senate seat from which Phil Gramm R will be retiringStenholm who has been able to win in GOPleaning counties said he is prepared to run and w in whatever the district lines areWhile partisans on both sides expect the majority of states redistricting plans to end up in court Republicans h ave contended that they will emerge from the process with a net gain of ei ght to seats Democrats have contended that the process will be a wash with neither party coming out aheadJust last week Democrats won what is likely to be their biggest victory in the process creating seven district s in Georgia with Democratic voting histories of at least percent If t he Democrats win those seats their triumph will amount to a fourseat pic kupIn most states the battle involves just one seat at most and in many cases the two parties are agreeing to protect incumbents with no changeT he GOP controls the process in Michigan where the party is likely to pick up two seats The GOP also controls the process in Pennsylvania Ohio

Company Inc The electricity market in California has swung over its history from monopolization by industrialists in its early days to comprehensive regulation then to partial deregulation in the s and now back toward substantial regulation and government intervention In the past each swing of the pendulum came from public frustration with the way this market operated and each produced a result that the public again found unsatisfactory But the memory of politicians and the public is short The state is poised to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle of regulation Measures passed by the California Legislature this month are an illconceived intervention that will lock the state into high energy costs and put it at a competitive disadvantage for years to come Unless there is further action the state will maintain subsidized retail prices that discourage conservation while capping instate wholesale prices in a manner that discourages construction of new instate generation capacity and leaves Californians at the mercy of outofstate generators Government subsidization of electricity consumption will drain tax revenues that might be better used for education and other needs encumber Californias children with debt to pay the states energy bills and threaten the states future ability to sell bonds for public projects The immediate political cost of consumer outrage from higher electricity rates may be postponed but the real economic cost promises to be massive The sad thing is that this is all unnecessary The source of the crisis was rigid regulation of retail prices in the face of rapid increases in wholesale prices driven by increased fuel prices and increased demand in the national electricity market The only effective solution to the crisis is to make retail price regulation more flexible so that consumers see the real economic cost of electricity and respond to high prices through conservation efforts that reduce demand and push prices down On the supply side the state should encourage construction of new instate generation capacity through the right market signals giving producers the opportunity to site plants and sell power under conditions comparable to other states Its true that state action was needed to stabilize the electricity market avoid immediate bankruptcy of the distribution companies and assure continued delivery of energy But this step will only postpone the day of reckoning unless sensible electricity pricing is introduced as well To limit the impact of high prices on the poor increasing blockrate tariffs can be used in which the rates for lifeline electricity use are kept low These were effective in limiting demand for water during Californias last drought and are already used to promote energy conservation A more aggressive version that pushes the rates in highusage blocks to the real loadlinked economic cost of electricity would provide an incentive that would stimulate conservation at the precise points that will do the most to moderate demand and push down wholesale prices Consumers should have the opportunity to hedge against price spikes and average their payments to ease the pain of price volatility The installation of loadsensitive meters should be accelerated so that consumers can respond to the economic price of the electricity they are consuming This is new technology for US utilities but has operated well in France for years On the supply side the state and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could use their regulatory power to require that existing generators redirect excess profits to finance lifeline rates for retail customers and work off the hangover from previous electricity purchased and not paid for However care should be taken in dealing with generators to assure that every kilowatt hour that any generation facility can produce at less than the national wholesale price of electricity is in fact delivered to the market The state needs to be very cautious about getting into the power business as an intermediary between generators and distributors Government bureaucracies rarely show dexterity in dealing with private suppliers and access to general government revenues dulls their incentive to operate efficiently Negotiating longterm contracts right now when California is in a weak market position and the outofstate generators are in the drivers seat is likely to put the state at a future competitive disadvantage Consumers need to be reminded that money passed through the government to subsidize electricity comes out of their pockets just as surely as price increases without the mitigating benefits of demand reductionThe lessons of history suggest that in making the Hobsons choice between a dysfunctional partially deregulated market and a fullyregulated one that promises to be even more dysfunctional California is picking the greater of the two evils If it fails to move to sensible electricity pricing in which both consumers and suppliers see the real economic price at the margin it will face another even more serious crisis in the not too distant future Mr McFadden a professor of economics at the
