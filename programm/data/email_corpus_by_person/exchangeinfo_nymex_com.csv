<24656002.1075847353667.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2001-04-20 05:48:00, Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm April TO All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm DATE April DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o f rule changes which are summarized below to incorporate the implementation of enymexK These rule changes which have been filed with the CFTC and thu s may become effective at any time will be implemented upon the launch of enymexK An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchanges website A hard copy blackline version of the rule changes which shows changes from the current rules can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson at in the Exchanges Legal Department The rule changes include the following areas trading position limits accountability and reporting arbitration Clearing Member obligations and a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the rollou t of enymexK such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS and enymexK For example the NYMEX ACCESS error trade rule has been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal

Members All COMEX Division Members From Neal Wolkoff Executive Vice President Re Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine StructureNYMEX COMEX Divisions Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted at dates to be announced during June July and August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Complianc e Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee As incentive any member attending the class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between an d The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over u p to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandar d trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do over mont h but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a s a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed in the third week of the months listed at a date to be announced and the program will apply to the next full month

on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread

Members All COMEX Division Members From Neal Wolkoff Executive Vice President Re Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine StructureNYMEX COMEX Divisions Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted on Thursday June Tuesday July and Wednesday August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Compliance Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee Details on class location and signup procedures will follow As incentive any member attending any one class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works a nd successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandard trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do o ver month but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed on June July and August and the program will apply to the next

this recommendation in the past and the Exchange has committed to respond to it The COMEX Division oneminute trad e time statistics already include spreads NYMEX Division Members should note that intracommodity spread trades will be incorporated into pit card oneminute trade time accuracy rates after a phase in process of approximately days In order to avoid subst andard percentages once spreads are incorporated members must make sure that thei r spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change Register for spreads is accurate If a spread print is not reported you will not be credited with timely submission of pit cards even if you throw the trade into the pit in a timely manner Pit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX floor on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread

letters of credit for use o n a passthrough basis at the Exchange This form may be obtained from the Exchanges Clearing Department Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Specification of Joint Beneficiary The PassThrough Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the PassThrough Letter of Credit provides for Joi nt Beneficiaries In this regard a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries By comparison a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used a s margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit Please note that under applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidia ry or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank bank parent or affiliate bank As to the actual rule amendments which are attached below these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions Letters of Credit As a result of the rule changes letters of credit LCs now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions Use of Letters of Credit on PassThrough Basis In addition the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a passthrough basis on bot h

deliverable warehouse receipts a s detailed below may be used by customers for margin purposes such assets m ay not be used on a passthrough basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse Securities Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing Members certain types of securities as margin The types of acceptable securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim e on the COMEX Division Specifically the rule changes will permit customer s to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member s on either division securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inc or the American Stock Exchange Inc or which are traded in the overthecounter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances can represent no more than of the issued and outstanding shares of any o ne issuer

Executive Vice President DATE October RE Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants which is attached and is now in effect New NYMEX Rule C which is consistent with a recent CFTC Advisory permits FCMs under certain conditions specified in the rule to use their own internal proprietary systems to generate average price AP calculations when multiple prices are received on an order or series of orders AP calculations are not being provided by the Exchange for NYMEX Division contracts New NYMEX Rule C is applicable only to NYMEX Division contracts A similar proposal for COMEX Division contracts remains pending with the CFTC The conditions specified in NYMEX Rule C include the following The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer If you have any questions please contact Tom LaSala Vice President Compliance Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at Approved New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Entire rule is new Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants A Eligible Accounts An FCM subject to compliance with the conditions specified in this rule may report andor confirm to customers an average of multiple execution prices and may use its own proprietary system to make such average price calculations regardless of whether the Exchange also provides a service for average price calculations for the applicable NYMEX Division contract provided a that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of an order or series of orders to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the same account or group of accounts or b that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of trades to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the FCMs proprietary accounts provided further however that trades for such a proprietary account are not averaged with trades for any other account For purposes of this rule eligible accounts may include multiple accounts that are part of a managed account program or other common investment program Eligible accounts may include individual nondiscretionary accounts except that prices for nondiscretionary accounts may not be averaged with prices for other nondiscretionary accounts Eligible accounts also may include individual discretionary accounts consistent with the provisions of Exchange Rule B An FCM may use its own system to calculate average prices for contracts executed on the Exchange provided that the following conditions are met for all such transactions The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price as calculated pursuant to the requirements of Section C below The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer C Calculation of Average Price The weighted mathematical average price shall be computed by FCMs by a multiplying the number of contracts purchased or sold at each execution price by that price b adding the results together and c dividing by the total number of contracts For a series of orders the average price may be computed based on the average price of each order in that series FCMs may confirm to customers either the actual average price or the average price rounded to the next price increment provided however that in confirming the average price rounded to the next price increment the FCM must round the average price up to the next price increment for a buy order or down to the next price increment for a sell order and must pay any residual thus created to the customer except that any residual amount of less than one cent may be retained by the FCM Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email emailemaillogcfmuseremailrefdo c Note If you click on the above

<19258647.1075847016729.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-04 08:38:00, Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Notice Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening October trade date October the NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin offering implied trading functionality pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission This feature will once again create implied bids and offers in all futures intramarket calendar spread and intercommodity spread markets based on orders in related markets Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system For example if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude oil at a set differential the system will automatically seek the best offe r to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil based on the differential to the other market To do this the system examines the outright orders orders directly entered into the system and creates bids and offers that are implied by the combination of specific outright orders The system the n creates the implied bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be traded against If a trader trades against this implied order then the outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade TwoWay Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commoditys outright futures market will combine t o create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and intercommodity spreads The reverse is also true ie orders entered into the calendar spread market or the intercommodity spread market ca n combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread orders For example two separate calendar spread orders one to buy a January contract and sell a February contract and another to buy a Februar y contract and sell a March contract will create an implied order for a buy Januarysell March spread The system will also generate implied intercommodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order s and other intercommodity spread orders and it will generate implied calendar spread orders from the combination of intercommodity spread order s and other calendar spread orders Implied Order Creation and the DepthofMarket Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied orders price is th e best price in the market Consequently a particular markets best pric e volume may be composed of outright volume implied volume or a combination of outright and implied volume The depthofmarket view of a contract wil l only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract s BEST bid and offer prices Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the best price for a contract will NOT show in the depthofmarket view Please note that although the depthofmarket will not display volume from implied orders at prices other than the best if a sweep order an order to purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range is entered with a price that would trade through the undisplayed implied orde r the implied order will be filled Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders then the color will be displayed in BLACK font If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to implied orders then the color will be displayed in RED font If the volume of the best bid or offer is a combination then the color will be displayed in PURPLE font Warning Do not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells which is done in the View Preferences Attributes screen to the same colors that appear in the Implied Prices Full and Part fields also located in the same View Preferences Attributes screen If you do you will not be able to view the implied prices Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order entry be turned off Therefore there is no ability to directly enter a cross order a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers accounts by the same broker into the NYMEX ACCESSc system This functionality is planned as a future enhancement Orders should be entere d in the order received from the customers If you have two orders in hand that would normally be entered as a cross order you should enter the order received first wait ten seconds and then enter the order received second Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit y please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center NACC at US UK or Far East The NACC can provide you wi th a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and

AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE October RE Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors The Resolution amends on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM EX ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc The price fluctuation limit rules th at are now in effect for the Exchanges contracts will remain the same for trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours RTH on the trading floor The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday October By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi ng activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with rega rd to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits would be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts would be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During the la st minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits Finally notwithstanding the changes noted above in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading then the RTH session would ope n with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul e even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM EX ACCESSc trading session If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCES Sc Operations NYMEX ACCESSc Department at Matt

NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc

<12838472.1075847021799.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-12 09:39:00, Trading Card Recordation Procedures and TMS on COMEXNo October TO COMEX Division Floor Community FROM Michael Campanelli Vice President Floor Operations COMEX Division RE New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th e Trade Management System TMS on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below please ref er to referncenoticesntmhtm Introduction As you are aware in the near future the Exchange plans to merge the two divisions onto one trade processing platform The COMEX Division will replace its OnLine Trade Entry OLTE system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme nt System TMS While final details are being determined certain procedural aspects of the transition process can begin Therefore effective immediately the followi ng should be considered Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card Floor staff will collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da ta Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades The trading card s will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members PCMs ins tead they will be retained by the Exchange THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX Each sell side will generate a buy side The brokers staff will be responsible for Account Assignment Trade Checkou t and Corrections in addition for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t he execution time Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS members must begin to use new trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur e WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL Y to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation procedures and enable the Exchanges Trade Processing staff to review th e handwritingrecordation techniques of the COMEX Divisions membership pr ior to launch During this interim period if necessary staff will contact members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures In addition staff will begin to familiarize members clerks with TMS functionality Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction To accomplis h this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t he trading card when heshe is the seller of the spread see recordation procedures noted below This indication will inform data entry personnel t o enter the entire spread buy and sell components Opposite buy spreads n ot keyed by the Exchange that are linked to a seller status will be generated by the system NOTE When submitting cards for data entry the differential must be indicated or it will be rejected If the differential is noted without prices for either leg the system will assign the appropriate market pricin g to both legs based on the most recent price reports If the differential i s noted along with the price of one of the legs the system will assign an appropriate price to the other leg Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community the following trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers ALPHA CODES ONLY TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes therefore use only the appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade processing SPREADS MULTIPLE LEG TRADES Place the value of the spread differential in the bottom portion of each entry lines center field Circle the spread value This will inform da ta entry personnel that the trade is a spread see eg NOTE Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the spread This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread see e g Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple leg spread is involved for example Butterflies this will convey that al l the components are part of one entity see eg CABINET TRADES Place CAB or C in the premium column see eg CONVERSIONS Place the option components on one line The futures component price must be written on the next line across the Strike and Premium columns see eg MATCHED ORDERS Place MO in the price column see eg Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive the previous days settlement prices until the current days settleme nt prices are determined and immediately applied EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL EFPS Place EFP or E in the SPD box bottom portion of each entry lines center field see eg Crossing of Orders Place a Y in the spread SPD box see eg line A except when crossi ng an EFP at which time the letters EFP must be indicated instead see e g line B Additionally it will not be necessary to denote a Y for cros s trades that require the recordation of a differential Note The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere d by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade Th e buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner Strip Trades Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive trade lines with the average price indicated in the price column Write STRIP adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo r data entry personnel see eg Note The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types of trades are shown in examples through Short Codes When it is possible the account area on the card should be used to indicate the appropriate short code The Exchange will data enter the sellers short code and the corresponding account assignment information will be generated Note When a short code is provided as part of spread sellers sell leg information the allocation will be applied to both the sell leg and the bu y leg If the buy is intended for the same customer but a different clearing member a reallocation will be necessary Trading Months st occurrence month symbol nd occurrence circled month symbol Beyond nd occurrence month symbol plus the last digit of the appropriate year Trading Card Submission Requirements Cards must be submitted within minutes of the time of execution of the first trade buy or sell recorded on the card For example a trade execut ed at am must be submitted no later than am Submission performance will be monitored by the Exchange and those brokers deemed nondiligent will be subject to disciplinary action Note Cards that include trades executed during either the close or postclose must be submitted within minutes of the bell marking the end of each period Trading Ring Change Submission Procedure Cards must be submitted to the ring in which the trades appearing on them were executed Therefore in cases when a broker intends to leave one ring to trade in another prior to leaving if heshe has a partially completed card it must be submitted in the ring heshe is departing Trading in a Multiple Commodity Ring Trades that are recorded on a trading card that differ from the commodity indicated on the heading of the card should include the commodity name fo r example ALUMINUM written adjacent to the trade details on the same entry line see eg Audit Trail Timing Every trade whether buy or sell must have an accurate trade time There i s no change to the audit trail timing methodology Just as is current practice the execution times indicated by the broker on hisher trading cards will continue to be compared to the Exchange Times and Sales as well as the opposite brokers execution times Questions If you have questions regarding the new trading card procedures please call Michael Campanelli at or David Sherma n at THE EXCHANGE WILL BE CONDUCTING PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES CLASSES IN THE NEAR FUTURE ATTENDANCE WILL BE MANDATORY FOR BOTH BROKERS AND THEIR CLERKS A SCHEDULE WILL BE FORTHCOMING Please click on the link

Directors RE Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised on Wednesday October the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan the Plan conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchanges pending demutualization plan On October the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions At the meeting a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the discount rate recommended by Deloitte Touche in connection with termination of the Plan At the members meeting it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting Following the members meeting the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between and and recommended using a discount rate of The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between and depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues Each of the actuaries including Deloitte Touche attended the Board meeting on November to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board The Board was advised by the Exchanges General Counsel as well as by two independent outside counsels that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee the Committee composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan After the Board formed the Committee the members of the Committee the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately After thoroughly reviewing the matter the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is On October the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS At its meeting on November the Board set a target closing date of November for the demutualization transaction Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan Under the terms of the Plan in the event of termination Qualified Participants ie those participants with at least years of Continuous Service as defined in the Plan are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value NPV of the scheduled tenyear benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service as defined in the Plan between years and years These year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is If there are not sufficient assets to pay each year participant their calculated sums then each year participant will receive a pro rata distribution These year participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review At this time the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lumpsum benefit based upon the approved a discount rate of At this time it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to year participants year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age see attached Schedule by the fraction of their whole years of service or by twentysix which at this time appears to be the approximate percentage of remaining assets available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in midJanuary As of December it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately million Regardless of the discount rate used of the assets of the Plan will be distributed Using a discount rate of the Qualified Participants will receive approximately million or ninety percent of the total Plan assets and year participants will receive the balance For illustrative purposes and subject to the conditions noted above the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lumpsum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits as of December In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan please contact Chris Bowen at or Suellen Galish at Copies of both the original and amended Plans are available Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments In accordance with Section of the original Plan in the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths vote of the Board Section of both the original and amended Plan provides that the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part upon the affirmative vote of three fourths of the entire Board Section of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination Section C states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion in good faith and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties Section entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged from the original Plan only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in Again contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV In fact the estates of two deceased former members Mel Miller and Leon Grappel that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of actually received payments based upon discount rates of paid in and paid in respectively Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution Attachment Age NPV Benefit discount

<10959244.1075847063808.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule

Executive Vice President DATE October RE Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants which is attached and is now in effect New NYMEX Rule C which is consistent with a recent CFTC Advisory permits FCMs under certain conditions specified in the rule to use their own internal proprietary systems to generate average price AP calculations when multiple prices are received on an order or series of orders AP calculations are not being provided by the Exchange for NYMEX Division contracts New NYMEX Rule C is applicable only to NYMEX Division contracts A similar proposal for COMEX Division contracts remains pending with the CFTC The conditions specified in NYMEX Rule C include the following The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer If you have any questions please contact Tom LaSala Vice President Compliance Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at Approved New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Entire rule is new Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants A Eligible Accounts An FCM subject to compliance with the conditions specified in this rule may report andor confirm to customers an average of multiple execution prices and may use its own proprietary system to make such average price calculations regardless of whether the Exchange also provides a service for average price calculations for the applicable NYMEX Division contract provided a that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of an order or series of orders to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the same account or group of accounts or b that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of trades to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the FCMs proprietary accounts provided further however that trades for such a proprietary account are not averaged with trades for any other account For purposes of this rule eligible accounts may include multiple accounts that are part of a managed account program or other common investment program Eligible accounts may include individual nondiscretionary accounts except that prices for nondiscretionary accounts may not be averaged with prices for other nondiscretionary accounts Eligible accounts also may include individual discretionary accounts consistent with the provisions of Exchange Rule B An FCM may use its own system to calculate average prices for contracts executed on the Exchange provided that the following conditions are met for all such transactions The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price as calculated pursuant to the requirements of Section C below The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer C Calculation of Average Price The weighted mathematical average price shall be computed by FCMs by a multiplying the number of contracts purchased or sold at each execution price by that price b adding the results together and c dividing by the total number of contracts For a series of orders the average price may be computed based on the average price of each order in that series FCMs may confirm to customers either the actual average price or the average price rounded to the next price increment provided however that in confirming the average price rounded to the next price increment the FCM must round the average price up to the next price increment for a buy order or down to the next price increment for a sell order and must pay any residual thus created to the customer except that any residual amount of less than one cent may be retained by the FCM Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email emailemaillogcfmuseremailrefdo c Note If you click on the above

<28890314.1075847114417.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-04 08:38:00, Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Notice Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening October trade date October the NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin offering implied trading functionality pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission This feature will once again create implied bids and offers in all futures intramarket calendar spread and intercommodity spread markets based on orders in related markets Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system For example if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude oil at a set differential the system will automatically seek the best offe r to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil based on the differential to the other market To do this the system examines the outright orders orders directly entered into the system and creates bids and offers that are implied by the combination of specific outright orders The system the n creates the implied bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be traded against If a trader trades against this implied order then the outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade TwoWay Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commoditys outright futures market will combine t o create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and intercommodity spreads The reverse is also true ie orders entered into the calendar spread market or the intercommodity spread market ca n combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread orders For example two separate calendar spread orders one to buy a January contract and sell a February contract and another to buy a Februar y contract and sell a March contract will create an implied order for a buy Januarysell March spread The system will also generate implied intercommodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order s and other intercommodity spread orders and it will generate implied calendar spread orders from the combination of intercommodity spread order s and other calendar spread orders Implied Order Creation and the DepthofMarket Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied orders price is th e best price in the market Consequently a particular markets best pric e volume may be composed of outright volume implied volume or a combination of outright and implied volume The depthofmarket view of a contract wil l only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract s BEST bid and offer prices Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the best price for a contract will NOT show in the depthofmarket view Please note that although the depthofmarket will not display volume from implied orders at prices other than the best if a sweep order an order to purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range is entered with a price that would trade through the undisplayed implied orde r the implied order will be filled Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders then the color will be displayed in BLACK font If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to implied orders then the color will be displayed in RED font If the volume of the best bid or offer is a combination then the color will be displayed in PURPLE font Warning Do not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells which is done in the View Preferences Attributes screen to the same colors that appear in the Implied Prices Full and Part fields also located in the same View Preferences Attributes screen If you do you will not be able to view the implied prices Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order entry be turned off Therefore there is no ability to directly enter a cross order a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers accounts by the same broker into the NYMEX ACCESSc system This functionality is planned as a future enhancement Orders should be entere d in the order received from the customers If you have two orders in hand that would normally be entered as a cross order you should enter the order received first wait ten seconds and then enter the order received second Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit y please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center NACC at US UK or Far East The NACC can provide you wi th a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors The Resolution amends on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM EX ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc The price fluctuation limit rules th at are now in effect for the Exchanges contracts will remain the same for trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours RTH on the trading floor The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday October By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi ng activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with rega rd to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits would be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts would be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During the la st minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits Finally notwithstanding the changes noted above in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading then the RTH session would ope n with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul e even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM EX ACCESSc trading session If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCES Sc Operations NYMEX ACCESSc Department at Matt

limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc

<22709069.1075847117996.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-12 09:39:00, Trading Card Recordation Procedures and TMS on COMEXNo October TO COMEX Division Floor Community FROM Michael Campanelli Vice President Floor Operations COMEX Division RE New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th e Trade Management System TMS on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below please ref er to referncenoticesntmhtm Introduction As you are aware in the near future the Exchange plans to merge the two divisions onto one trade processing platform The COMEX Division will replace its OnLine Trade Entry OLTE system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme nt System TMS While final details are being determined certain procedural aspects of the transition process can begin Therefore effective immediately the followi ng should be considered Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card Floor staff will collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da ta Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades The trading card s will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members PCMs ins tead they will be retained by the Exchange THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX Each sell side will generate a buy side The brokers staff will be responsible for Account Assignment Trade Checkou t and Corrections in addition for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t he execution time Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS members must begin to use new trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur e WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL Y to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation procedures and enable the Exchanges Trade Processing staff to review th e handwritingrecordation techniques of the COMEX Divisions membership pr ior to launch During this interim period if necessary staff will contact members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures In addition staff will begin to familiarize members clerks with TMS functionality Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction To accomplis h this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t he trading card when heshe is the seller of the spread see recordation procedures noted below This indication will inform data entry personnel t o enter the entire spread buy and sell components Opposite buy spreads n ot keyed by the Exchange that are linked to a seller status will be generated by the system NOTE When submitting cards for data entry the differential must be indicated or it will be rejected If the differential is noted without prices for either leg the system will assign the appropriate market pricin g to both legs based on the most recent price reports If the differential i s noted along with the price of one of the legs the system will assign an appropriate price to the other leg Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community the following trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers ALPHA CODES ONLY TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes therefore use only the appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade processing SPREADS MULTIPLE LEG TRADES Place the value of the spread differential in the bottom portion of each entry lines center field Circle the spread value This will inform da ta entry personnel that the trade is a spread see eg NOTE Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the spread This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread see e g Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple leg spread is involved for example Butterflies this will convey that al l the components are part of one entity see eg CABINET TRADES Place CAB or C in the premium column see eg CONVERSIONS Place the option components on one line The futures component price must be written on the next line across the Strike and Premium columns see eg MATCHED ORDERS Place MO in the price column see eg Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive the previous days settlement prices until the current days settleme nt prices are determined and immediately applied EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL EFPS Place EFP or E in the SPD box bottom portion of each entry lines center field see eg Crossing of Orders Place a Y in the spread SPD box see eg line A except when crossi ng an EFP at which time the letters EFP must be indicated instead see e g line B Additionally it will not be necessary to denote a Y for cros s trades that require the recordation of a differential Note The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere d by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade Th e buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner Strip Trades Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive trade lines with the average price indicated in the price column Write STRIP adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo r data entry personnel see eg Note The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types of trades are shown in examples through Short Codes When it is possible the account area on the card should be used to indicate the appropriate short code The Exchange will data enter the sellers short code and the corresponding account assignment information will be generated Note When a short code is provided as part of spread sellers sell leg information the allocation will be applied to both the sell leg and the bu y leg If the buy is intended for the same customer but a different clearing member a reallocation will be necessary Trading Months st occurrence month symbol nd occurrence circled month symbol Beyond nd occurrence month symbol plus the last digit of the appropriate year Trading Card Submission Requirements Cards must be submitted within minutes of the time of execution of the first trade buy or sell recorded on the card For example a trade execut ed at am must be submitted no later than am Submission performance will be monitored by the Exchange and those brokers deemed nondiligent will be subject to disciplinary action Note Cards that include trades executed during either the close or postclose must be submitted within minutes of the bell marking the end of each period Trading Ring Change Submission Procedure Cards must be submitted to the ring in which the trades appearing on them were executed Therefore in cases when a broker intends to leave one ring to trade in another prior to leaving if heshe has a partially completed card it must be submitted in the ring heshe is departing Trading in a Multiple Commodity Ring Trades that are recorded on a trading card that differ from the commodity indicated on the heading of the card should include the commodity name fo r example ALUMINUM written adjacent to the trade details on the same entry line see eg Audit Trail Timing Every trade whether buy or sell must have an accurate trade time There i s no change to the audit trail timing methodology Just as is current practice the execution times indicated by the broker on hisher trading cards will continue to be compared to the Exchange Times and Sales as well as the opposite brokers execution times Questions If you have questions regarding the new trading card procedures please call Michael Campanelli at or David Sherma n at THE EXCHANGE WILL BE CONDUCTING PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES CLASSES IN THE NEAR FUTURE ATTENDANCE WILL BE MANDATORY FOR BOTH BROKERS AND THEIR CLERKS A SCHEDULE WILL BE FORTHCOMING Please click on the link

Directors RE Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised on Wednesday October the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan the Plan conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchanges pending demutualization plan On October the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions At the meeting a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the discount rate recommended by Deloitte Touche in connection with termination of the Plan At the members meeting it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting Following the members meeting the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between and and recommended using a discount rate of The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between and depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues Each of the actuaries including Deloitte Touche attended the Board meeting on November to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board The Board was advised by the Exchanges General Counsel as well as by two independent outside counsels that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee the Committee composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan After the Board formed the Committee the members of the Committee the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately After thoroughly reviewing the matter the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is On October the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS At its meeting on November the Board set a target closing date of November for the demutualization transaction Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan Under the terms of the Plan in the event of termination Qualified Participants ie those participants with at least years of Continuous Service as defined in the Plan are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value NPV of the scheduled tenyear benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service as defined in the Plan between years and years These year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is If there are not sufficient assets to pay each year participant their calculated sums then each year participant will receive a pro rata distribution These year participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review At this time the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lumpsum benefit based upon the approved a discount rate of At this time it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to year participants year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age see attached Schedule by the fraction of their whole years of service or by twentysix which at this time appears to be the approximate percentage of remaining assets available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in midJanuary As of December it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately million Regardless of the discount rate used of the assets of the Plan will be distributed Using a discount rate of the Qualified Participants will receive approximately million or ninety percent of the total Plan assets and year participants will receive the balance For illustrative purposes and subject to the conditions noted above the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lumpsum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits as of December In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan please contact Chris Bowen at or Suellen Galish at Copies of both the original and amended Plans are available Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments In accordance with Section of the original Plan in the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths vote of the Board Section of both the original and amended Plan provides that the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part upon the affirmative vote of three fourths of the entire Board Section of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination Section C states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion in good faith and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties Section entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged from the original Plan only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in Again contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV In fact the estates of two deceased former members Mel Miller and Leon Grappel that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of actually received payments based upon discount rates of paid in and paid in respectively Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution Attachment Age NPV Benefit discount

<21667586.1075847144608.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule

<28634241.1075847433017.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2001-04-20 05:48:00, Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm April TO All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm DATE April DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o f rule changes which are summarized below to incorporate the implementation of enymexK These rule changes which have been filed with the CFTC and thu s may become effective at any time will be implemented upon the launch of enymexK An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchanges website A hard copy blackline version of the rule changes which shows changes from the current rules can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson at in the Exchanges Legal Department The rule changes include the following areas trading position limits accountability and reporting arbitration Clearing Member obligations and a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the rollou t of enymexK such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS and enymexK For example the NYMEX ACCESS error trade rule has been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal

Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted at dates to be announced during June July and August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Complianc e Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee As incentive any member attending the class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between an d The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over u p to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandar d trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do over mont h but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a s a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed in the third week of the months listed at a date to be announced and the program will apply to the next full month

recommendation in the past and the Exchange has committed to respond to it The COMEX Division oneminute trad e time statistics already include spreads NYMEX Division Members should note that intracommodity spread trades will be incorporated into pit card oneminute trade time accuracy rates after a phase in process of approximately days In order to avoid subst andard percentages once

on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread

Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted on Thursday June Tuesday July and Wednesday August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Compliance Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee Details on class location and signup procedures will follow As incentive any member attending any one class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works a nd successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandard trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do o ver month but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are

form may be obtained from the Exchanges Clearing Department Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Specification of Joint Beneficiary The PassThrough Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the PassThrough Letter of Credit provides for Joint Beneficiaries In this regard a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries By comparison a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the

deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank bank parent or affiliate bank As to the actual rule amendments which are attached below these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions Letters of Credit As a result of the rule changes letters of credit LCs now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions Use of Letters of Credit on PassThrough Basis In addition the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a passthrough basis on both divisions In other words Clearing Members on both divisions will be able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers It should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts as detailed below may be used by customers for margin purposes such assets may not be used on a passthrough basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse Securities Customers also will be able to deposit with

<24899298.1075844737186.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2001-04-20 05:48:00, Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm April TO All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm DATE April DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o f rule changes which are summarized below to incorporate the implementation of enymexK These rule changes which have been filed with the CFTC and thu s may become effective at any time will be implemented upon the launch of enymexK An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchanges website A hard copy blackline version of the rule changes which shows changes from the current rules can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson at in the Exchanges Legal Department The rule changes include the following areas trading position limits accountability and reporting arbitration Clearing Member obligations and a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the rollou t of enymexK such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS and enymexK For example the NYMEX ACCESS error trade rule has been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal

Members All COMEX Division Members From Neal Wolkoff Executive Vice President Re Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine StructureNYMEX COMEX Divisions Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted at dates to be announced during June July and August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Complianc e Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee As incentive any member attending the class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between an d The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over u p to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandar d trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do over mont h but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted a s a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed in the third week of the months listed at a date to be announced and the program will apply to the next full month

recommendation in the past and the Exchange has committed to respond to it The COMEX Division oneminute trad e time statistics already include spreads NYMEX Division Members should note that intracommodity spread trades will be incorporated into pit card oneminute trade time accuracy rates after a phase in process of approximately days In order to avoid subst andard percentages once spreads are incorporated members must make sure that thei r spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change Register for spreads is accurate If a spread print is not reported

on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread

Members All COMEX Division Members From Neal Wolkoff Executive Vice President Re Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine StructureNYMEX COMEX Divisions Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted on Thursday June Tuesday July and Wednesday August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Compliance Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee Details on class location and signup procedures will follow As incentive any member attending any one class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works a nd successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandard trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do o ver month but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed on June July and August and the program will apply to the next full month of audit trail results The Compliance Review Committee an d the Floor Committee will evaluate the results of this program before decidi ng whether to extend this program into Incorporation

this recommendation in the past and the Exchange has committed to respond to it The COMEX Division oneminute trad e time statistics already include spreads NYMEX Division Members should note that intracommodity spread trades will be incorporated into pit card oneminute trade time accuracy rates after a phase in process of approximately days In order to avoid subst andard percentages once spreads are incorporated members must make sure that thei r spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change Register for spreads is accurate If a spread print is not reported

warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX Division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual

will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violationfree months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purpose to improve pit card submission statistics Exchangewide by reducing the number of individual members falling below the standard fo r timely pit card submission and to facilitate their return to a warning letter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations

pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing percentage Members will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the material presented and pinpoint areas in which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan for raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor Committee and Compliance Review Committee Members and Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their timely submission rates fall between and No fine

that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problemfree months to return to a warning letter stage A member who has been problemfree for months woul d benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a fifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to the warning letter stage despite

Executive Vice President DATE October RE Notice of CFTC Approval of New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants which is attached and is now in effect New NYMEX Rule C which is consistent with a recent CFTC Advisory permits FCMs under certain conditions specified in the rule to use their own internal proprietary systems to generate average price AP calculations when multiple prices are received on an order or series of orders AP calculations are not being provided by the Exchange for NYMEX Division contracts New NYMEX Rule C is applicable only to NYMEX Division contracts A similar proposal for COMEX Division contracts remains pending with the CFTC The conditions specified in NYMEX Rule C include the following The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer If you have any questions please contact Tom LaSala Vice President Compliance Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at Approved New NYMEX Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants Entire rule is new Rule C Average Price Calculations by Futures Commission Merchants A Eligible Accounts An FCM subject to compliance with the conditions specified in this rule may report andor confirm to customers an average of multiple execution prices and may use its own proprietary system to make such average price calculations regardless of whether the Exchange also provides a service for average price calculations for the applicable NYMEX Division contract provided a that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of an order or series of orders to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the same account or group of accounts or b that such prices were obtained as the result of the execution of trades to purchase or sell the same futures andor the same option series for the FCMs proprietary accounts provided further however that trades for such a proprietary account are not averaged with trades for any other account For purposes of this rule eligible accounts may include multiple accounts that are part of a managed account program or other common investment program Eligible accounts may include individual nondiscretionary accounts except that prices for nondiscretionary accounts may not be averaged with prices for other nondiscretionary accounts Eligible accounts also may include individual discretionary accounts consistent with the provisions of Exchange Rule B An FCM may use its own system to calculate average prices for contracts executed on the Exchange provided that the following conditions are met for all such transactions The customer has requested average price reporting Each individual trade is submitted to and cleared by the Exchange at the executed price The FCM calculates and confirms to its customers a weighted mathematical average price as calculated pursuant to the requirements of Section C below The FCM possesses the records to support the calculations and the allocations to customer accounts and maintains all such records pursuant to CFTC regulations and further makes such records available for inspection by affected customers upon request and The FCM identifies each trade to which an average price is assigned as having an average price on each confirmation statement and monthly statement on which the trade is reported to the customer C Calculation of Average Price The weighted mathematical average price shall be computed by FCMs by a multiplying the number of contracts purchased or sold at each execution price by that price b adding the results together and c dividing by the total number of contracts For a series of orders the average price may be computed based on the average price of each order in that series FCMs may confirm to customers either the actual average price or the average price rounded to the next price increment provided however that in confirming the average price rounded to the next price increment the FCM must round the average price up to the next price increment for a buy order or down to the next price increment for a sell order and must pay any residual thus created to the customer except that any residual amount of less than one cent may be retained by the FCM Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email emailemaillogcfmuseremail refdoc Note If you click on the above

<19728660.1075844414050.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-04 08:38:00, Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Notice Implied Bid or Offer Functionality Returns to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening October trade date October the NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin offering implied trading functionality pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission This feature will once again create implied bids and offers in all futures intramarket calendar spread and intercommodity spread markets based on orders in related markets Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system For example if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude oil at a set differential the system will automatically seek the best offe r to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil based on the differential to the other market To do this the system examines the outright orders orders directly entered into the system and creates bids and offers that are implied by the combination of specific outright orders The system the n creates the implied bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be traded against If a trader trades against this implied order then the outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade TwoWay Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commoditys outright futures market will combine t o create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and intercommodity spreads The reverse is also true ie orders entered into the calendar spread market or the intercommodity spread market ca n combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread orders For example two separate calendar spread orders one to buy a January contract and sell a February contract and another to buy a Februar y contract and sell a March contract will create an implied order for a buy Januarysell March spread The system will also generate implied intercommodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order s and other intercommodity spread orders and it will generate implied calendar spread orders from the combination of intercommodity spread order s and other calendar spread orders Implied Order Creation and the DepthofMarket Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied orders price is th e best price in the market Consequently a particular markets best pric e volume may be composed of outright volume implied volume or a combination of outright and implied volume The depthofmarket view of a contract wil l only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract s BEST bid and offer prices Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the best price for a contract will NOT show in the depthofmarket view Please note that although the depthofmarket will not display volume from implied orders at prices other than the best if a sweep order an order to purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range is entered with a price that would trade through the undisplayed implied orde r the implied order will be filled Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders then the color will be displayed in BLACK font If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to implied orders then the color will be displayed in RED font If the volume of the best bid or offer is a combination then the color will be displayed in PURPLE font Warning Do not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells which is done in the View Preferences Attributes screen to the same colors that appear in the Implied Prices Full and Part fields also located in the same View Preferences Attributes screen If you do you will not be able to view the implied prices Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order entry be turned off Therefore there is no ability to directly enter a cross order a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers accounts by the same broker into the NYMEX ACCESSc system This functionality is planned as a future enhancement Orders should be entere d in the order received from the customers If you have two orders in hand that would normally be entered as a cross order you should enter the order received first wait ten seconds and then enter the order received second Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit y please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center NACC at US UK or Far East The NACC can provide you wi th a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and

the Exchanges contracts will remain the same for trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours RTH on the trading floor The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the commencement of

halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits Finally notwithstanding the changes noted above in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for

<26413042.1075844416235.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-12 09:39:00, Trading Card Recordation Procedures and TMS on COMEXNo October TO COMEX Division Floor Community FROM Michael Campanelli Vice President Floor Operations COMEX Division RE New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th e Trade Management System TMS on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below please ref er to referncenoticesntmhtm Introduction As you are aware in the near future the Exchange plans to merge the two divisions onto one trade processing platform The COMEX Division will replace its OnLine Trade Entry OLTE system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme nt System TMS While final details are being determined certain procedural aspects of the transition process can begin Therefore effective immediately the followi ng should be considered Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card Floor staff will collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da ta Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades The trading card s will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members PCMs ins tead they will be retained by the Exchange THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX Each sell side will generate a buy side The brokers staff will be responsible for Account Assignment Trade Checkou t and Corrections in addition for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t he execution time Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS members must begin to use new trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur e WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL Y to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation procedures and enable the Exchanges Trade Processing staff to review th e handwritingrecordation techniques of the COMEX Divisions membership pr ior to launch During this interim period if necessary staff will contact members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures In addition staff will begin to familiarize members clerks with TMS functionality Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction To accomplis h this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t he trading card when heshe is the seller of the spread see recordation procedures noted below This indication will inform data entry personnel t o enter the entire spread buy and sell components Opposite buy spreads n ot keyed by the Exchange that are linked to a seller status will be generated by the system NOTE When submitting cards for data entry the differential must be indicated or it will be rejected If the differential is noted without prices for either leg the system will assign the appropriate market pricin g to both legs based on the most recent price reports If the differential i s noted along with the price of one of the legs the system will assign an appropriate price to the other leg Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community the following trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers ALPHA CODES ONLY TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes therefore use only the appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade processing SPREADS MULTIPLE LEG TRADES Place the value of the spread differential in the bottom portion of each entry lines center field Circle the spread value This will inform da ta entry personnel that the trade is a spread see eg NOTE Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the spread This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread see e g Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple leg spread is involved for example Butterflies this will convey that al l the components are part of one entity see eg CABINET TRADES Place CAB or C in the premium column see eg CONVERSIONS Place the option components on one line The futures component price must be written on the next line across the Strike and Premium columns see eg MATCHED ORDERS Place MO in the price column see eg Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive the previous days settlement prices until the current days settleme nt prices are determined and immediately applied EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL EFPS Place EFP or E in the SPD box bottom portion of each entry lines center field see eg Crossing of Orders Place a Y in the spread SPD box see eg line A except when crossi ng an EFP at which time the letters EFP must be indicated instead see e g line B Additionally it will not be necessary to denote a Y for cros s trades that require the recordation of a differential Note The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere d by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade Th e buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner Strip Trades Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive trade lines with the average price indicated in the price column Write STRIP adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo r data entry personnel see eg Note The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types of trades are shown in examples through Short Codes When it is possible the account area on the card should be used to indicate the appropriate short code The Exchange will data enter the sellers short code and the corresponding account assignment information will be generated Note When a short code is provided as part of spread sellers sell leg information the allocation will be applied to both the sell leg and the bu y leg If the buy is intended for the same customer but a different clearing member a reallocation will be necessary Trading Months st occurrence month symbol nd occurrence circled month symbol Beyond nd occurrence month symbol plus the last digit of the appropriate year Trading Card Submission Requirements Cards must be submitted within minutes of the time of execution of the first trade buy or sell recorded on the card For example a trade execut ed at am must be submitted no later than am Submission performance will be monitored by the Exchange and those brokers deemed nondiligent will be subject to disciplinary action Note Cards that include trades executed during either the close or postclose must be submitted within minutes of the bell marking the end of each period Trading Ring Change Submission Procedure Cards must be submitted to the ring in which the trades appearing on them were executed Therefore in cases when a broker intends to leave one ring to trade in another prior to leaving if heshe has a partially completed card it must be submitted in the ring heshe is departing Trading in a Multiple Commodity Ring Trades that are recorded on a trading card that differ from the commodity indicated on the heading of the card should include the commodity name fo r example ALUMINUM written adjacent to the trade details on the same entry line see eg Audit Trail Timing Every trade whether buy or sell must have an accurate trade time There i s no change to the audit trail timing methodology Just as is current practice the execution times indicated by the broker on hisher trading cards will continue to be compared to the Exchange Times and Sales as well as the opposite brokers execution times Questions If you have questions regarding the new trading card procedures please call Michael Campanelli at or David Sherma n at THE EXCHANGE WILL BE CONDUCTING PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES CLASSES IN THE NEAR FUTURE ATTENDANCE WILL BE MANDATORY FOR BOTH BROKERS AND THEIR CLERKS A SCHEDULE WILL BE FORTHCOMING Please click on the link

Directors RE Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised on Wednesday October the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan the Plan conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchanges pending demutualization plan On October the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions At the meeting a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the discount rate recommended by Deloitte Touche in connection with termination of the Plan At the members meeting it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting Following the members meeting the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between and and recommended using a discount rate of The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between and depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues Each of the actuaries including Deloitte Touche attended the Board meeting on November to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board The Board was advised by the Exchanges General Counsel as well as by two independent outside counsels that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee the Committee composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan After the Board formed the Committee the members of the Committee the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately After thoroughly reviewing the matter the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is On October the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS At its meeting on November the Board set a target closing date of November for the demutualization transaction Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan Under the terms of the Plan in the event of termination Qualified Participants ie those participants with at least years of Continuous Service as defined in the Plan are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value NPV of the scheduled tenyear benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service as defined in the Plan between years and years These year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is If there are not sufficient assets to pay each year participant their calculated sums then each year participant will receive a pro rata distribution These year participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review At this time the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lumpsum benefit based upon the approved a discount rate of At this time it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to year participants year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age see attached Schedule by the fraction of their whole years of service or by twentysix which at this time appears to be the approximate percentage of remaining assets available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in midJanuary As of December it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately million Regardless of the discount rate used of the assets of the Plan will be distributed Using a discount rate of the Qualified Participants will receive approximately million or ninety percent of the total Plan assets and year participants will receive the balance For illustrative purposes and subject to the conditions noted above the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lumpsum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits as of December In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan please contact Chris Bowen at or Suellen Galish at Copies of both the original and amended Plans are available Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments In accordance with Section of the original Plan in the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths vote of the Board Section of both the original and amended Plan provides that the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part upon the affirmative vote of three fourths of the entire Board Section of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination Section C states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion in good faith and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties Section entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged from the original Plan only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in Again contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV In fact the estates of two deceased former members Mel Miller and Leon Grappel that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of actually received payments based upon discount rates of paid in and paid in respectively Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution Attachment Age NPV Benefit discount

<16830821.1075844446734.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents

the Training and Education Committee You may sign up for these classes at the Corrections Windows on the rd and th floors or by contacting Lois S Shapiro Associate Compliance Counsel at The June class will be hel d in the Seminar Room on the th floor at pm Plan to stay until pm Credit will not be given to anyone who does not attend the entire cla ss As incentive any member attending any one class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violationfree months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purpose to improve pit card submission statistics Exchangewide by reducing the number of individual members falling below the standard fo r timely pit card submission and to facilitate their return to a warning letter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered on June July and August with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for achieving a passing percentage Members will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the material presented and pinpoint areas in which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan for raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor Committee and Compliance Review Committee Members and Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their timely submission rates fall between and No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do over month but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problemfree months to return to a warning letter stage A member who has been problemfree for months woul d benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a fifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to the warning letter stage despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problemfree months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as lo ng as he meets all the above criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff on an individual basis Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by ema il or telephone upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class to take advantage of the benefits listed herein Classes will be offered on June July and August and the program will apply to the next full month of audit trail statistics The Compliance Review Committee and the Floor Committee will evaluate the results of this program before deciding whether to extend this program into Incorporation of Spreads into

on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells the premium month In the case where the spread trades flat the seller is the party who sells the nearby month If you have any questions about this information

Members All COMEX Division Members From Neal Wolkoff Executive Vice President Re Changes to Audit Trail Summary Fine StructureNYMEX COMEX Divisions Incorporation of Spreads into One Minute Trade Time Submission for NYMEX Modification of Clearout Period The Board of Directors has approved modifications to the fine structure for oneminute trade time submission for both NYMEX and COMEX divisions Presently members falling below timely submission per month are issued escalating warning letters and fines unless and until they clear out their record by being in compliance for six consecutive months After six months the member returns to a warning letter level Effective immediatel y this clearout period is reduced from six months to four months Onemi nute trade timing statistics for the month ending April will reflect th is modification Implementation of OneMinute TradeTime Classes The Board also accepted the recommendation of the Compliance Review Committ ee and Floor Committee to adopt a training program for members facing oneminu te trade time fines on the NYMEX division The purpose of the program is to improve Exchange trade submission timing through member education by identifying individual issues tailoring individual solutions and statistic al followup Training will be conducted on Thursday June Tuesday July and Wednesday August by a team comprised of Committee Members and Compliance Staff with the assistance of the Training and Education Committee Details on class location and signup procedures will follow As incentive any member attending any one class will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which their trade time rates are between and The member will still have to complete four violation free months before his record is cleared out but he may take up to six months t o do so Members may take one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works a nd successful strategies for achieving a passing grade Members attending cla ss will be required to analyze their own trading style in light of the materia l presented and pinpoint areas which they need to improve Members will also be required to outline a plan of attack to address raising their pit card performance rates Each plan will be discussed with the group and members will receive feedback from Floor and Compliance Review Committee Members a nd Compliance and Floor Department Staff Members attending classes are strongly encouraged to bring their clerks with them Upon completion of the class members will be allowed to do over up to two subsequent months in which they received the warning or fine for substandard trade time rates between and on their way to achieving four months clear No fine or warning letter will be issued for a do o ver month but the month will not count as a passing month A member who falls below will receive a fine or warning letter The benefit to the member will be that the month that would have counted as a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over month as long as he meets all criteria Staff will follow up with members attending the classes Members will receive a breakdown of their most recent audit trail fine They will also be invited to discuss their percentages with staff oneonone Further staff will supply daily or weekly statistics to any member by email upon request Members are eligible for only one class per year A member must take a class before being given the benefits listed herein Classes will be offer ed on June July and August and the program will apply to the next

one class per year Audit Trail Classes Purposeto reduce number of members falling below the standard for pit card submission and to facilitate the return of members to a warning le tter level Members who have received a warning letter or a fine for pit card violations may Attend an audit trail class to be offered in June July and August of with future dates to be determined by the Floor CommitteeCompliance Review Committee The class will be an intensive discussion of pit card problems and pitfalls Materials will focus on how the audit trail works and successful strategies for

month that would have counted a s a failing month will not count at all as long as the member achieved at least a rate Members still need four problem free months to return to a warning letter stage from a fine stage A member who has been problem free for months would benefit by doing over a fourth and possibly a f ifth failing month thus having the opportunity to return to a warning letter phase despite intervening failing months A member who falls below before achieving four problem free months will receive a fine or a warning letter as appropriate The member can still use a second do over

CFTC audi t of the Exchanges Compliance programs and proceduresthe CFTC recommend ed that the NYMEX Division incorporate spread trades into the oneminute time statistics The CFTC has made this recommendation in the past and the Exchange has committed to respond to it The COMEX Division oneminute trad e time statistics already include spreads NYMEX Division Members should note that intracommodity spread trades will be incorporated into pit card oneminute trade time accuracy rates after a phase in process of approximately days In order to avoid subst andard percentages once spreads are incorporated members must make sure that thei r spread prints are price reported in order to ensure that the Price Change Register for spreads is accurate If a spread print is not reported you will not be credited with timely submission of pit cards even if you throw the trade into the pit in a timely manner Pit card statistics for outright trades are presently posted on the NYMEX floor on a weekly basis Compliance Staff will continue to post statistics for outright trades and will additionally post the statistics for spread trades These spread trade statistics are for information only so that you can assess your pit card submission rate in advance of incorporation of spreads in the oneminute trade time submission percentages For informati on purposes the seller of the spread is considered to be the party who sells the premium month In the case where the spread trades flat the seller is the party who sells the nearby month If you have any questions about this information

Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm DATE April DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o f rule changes which are summarized below to incorporate the implementation of enymexK These rule changes which have been filed with the CFTC and thu s may become effective at any time will be implemented upon the launch of enymexK An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchanges website A hard copy blackline version of the rule changes which shows changes from the current rules can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson at in the Exchanges Legal Department The rule changes include the following areas trading position limits accountability and reporting arbitration Clearing Member obligations and a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the rollou t of enymexK such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS and enymexK For example the NYMEX ACCESS error trade rule has been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal

<30844151.1075844473949.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-11-09 06:04:00, Termination of Members Retention and Retirement PlanNo November TO NYMEX Division Members FROM The Board of Directors RE Termination of Members Retention and Retirement Plan As you have been previously advised on Wednesday October the Board of Directors voted unanimously to terminate the New York Mercantile Exchange Members Retention and Retirement Plan the Plan conditioned upon the Exchange receiving a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS in connection with the Exchanges pending demutualization plan On October the Exchange held an open members meeting to discuss the termination of the Plan and to answer any questions At the meeting a number of members requested that the Board review its decision to use the discount rate recommended by Deloitte Touche in connection with termination of the Plan At the members meeting it was agreed that the Board would review the discount rate issue again at its next regular meeting Following the members meeting the Exchange obtained two additional professional opinions from actuaries One opinion stated that the appropriate range of discount rates that should be used in terminating the Plan should be between and and recommended using a discount rate of The third opinion recommended that the appropriate range should be between and depending upon various credit and other related actuarial issues Each of the actuaries including Deloitte Touche attended the Board meeting on November to present the rationale in support of their respective recommendations and to answer any questions posed by members of the Board The Board was advised by the Exchanges General Counsel as well as by two independent outside counsels that in order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest the Board should delegate authority to choose an appropriate discount rate to a committee of Directors who do not have any financial interest in the Plan The Board passed a resolution in which it approved the recommendation of its Counsel and delegated authority to select an appropriate discount rate to a special committee the Committee composed of five Directors who did not have an interest in the Plan After the Board formed the Committee the members of the Committee the actuaries and the legal advisors left the room to discuss the matter privately After thoroughly reviewing the matter the Committee returned and unanimously resolved and determined that the appropriate discount rate that should be used in connection with the termination of the Plan is On October the Exchange received a satisfactory Private Letter Ruling from the IRS At its meeting on November the Board set a target closing date of November for the demutualization transaction Eligible participants of the Plan who are members at the time of the closing of demutualization will receive service credit under the plan through December All other rules regarding eligibility and continuous service requirements will be applied according to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan Under the terms of the Plan in the event of termination Qualified Participants ie those participants with at least years of Continuous Service as defined in the Plan are entitled to a payout equal to the net present value NPV of the scheduled tenyear benefit payment that they would otherwise have received if the Plan had not terminated to the extent of the assets held in trust for this purpose If there are remaining assets in trust after making payment to the Qualified Participants those remaining assets are to be distributed to participants with Continuous Service as defined in the Plan between years and years These year participants are entitled to the NPV of a fraction of the benefits they would have received had the Plan remained in place until their normal retirement age the numerator of the fraction is the number of whole years of Continuous Service and the denominator is If there are not sufficient assets to pay each year participant their calculated sums then each year participant will receive a pro rata distribution These year participants must be members of record at the time of the closing of demutualization in order to be eligible to receive any distribution The Exchange is reviewing the census data and other pertinent considerations with its actuaries and all preliminary calculations should be regarded as tentative and subject to change pending the results of that review At this time the Board believes that there are sufficient assets to pay each Qualified Participant his or her lumpsum benefit based upon the approved a discount rate of At this time it appears that after making payments to Qualified Participants the remaining assets will be sufficient to provide pro rata benefits to year participants year participants can calculate their approximate distribution amount by multiplying the NPV benefit of their corresponding age see attached Schedule by the fraction of their whole years of service or by twentysix which at this time appears to be the approximate percentage of remaining assets available compared to the total of all partial benefits otherwise calculated Qualified Participants who are already receiving benefits received their last quarterly payment in October Remaining obligations to such participants will be valued in the same manner as other Qualified Participants It is anticipated that actual payouts under the termination procedure will be made in midJanuary As of December it is expected that total Plan assets will be approximately million Regardless of the discount rate used of the assets of the Plan will be distributed Using a discount rate of the Qualified Participants will receive approximately million or ninety percent of the total Plan assets and year participants will receive the balance For illustrative purposes and subject to the conditions noted above the attached Schedule represents an approximation of the anticipated lumpsum payment to a Qualified Participant who has reached the age indicated but who has not yet begun receiving quarterly benefits as of December In the event that any member has any questions in connection with termination of the Plan please contact Chris Bowen at or Suellen Galish at Copies of both the original and amended Plans are available Separate But Related Matter Contrary to erroneous information which has been disseminated by others neither the original Members Retention and Retirement Plan nor the amended Plan provides for member votes on amendments In accordance with Section of the original Plan in the amended Plan was approved by a three fourths vote of the Board Section of both the original and amended Plan provides that the Board of Directors of NYMEX may at anytime amend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part upon the affirmative vote of three fourths of the entire Board Section of the Plan further specifically describes how the Plan assets are to be distributed in the event of termination Section C states that the net present value of lump sum termination payments shall be calculated by using the applicable interest rate determined by the Board in its sole discretion in good faith and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on all parties Section entitled Authorization of the Plan and which remains unchanged from the original Plan only applies to the original authorization of the Plan which occurred in Again contrary to erroneous assertions that have been made neither the original Plan nor the amended Plan makes any reference to a specific discount rate that should be used in calculating NPV In fact the estates of two deceased former members Mel Miller and Leon Grappel that erroneously have been reported to have received lump sum payments based upon a discount rate of actually received payments based upon discount rates of paid in and paid in respectively Inaccurate contentions and allegations diminish and undermine what we are seeking to achieve as a global financial institution Attachment Age NPV Benefit discount

<24947187.1075844480967.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-10-12 09:39:00, Trading Card Recordation Procedures and TMS on COMEXNo October TO COMEX Division Floor Community FROM Michael Campanelli Vice President Floor Operations COMEX Division RE New Trading Card Recordation Procedures Related to the Implementation of th e Trade Management System TMS on COMEX For trading card images mentioned as examples in the text below please ref er to referncenoticesntmhtm Introduction As you are aware in the near future the Exchange plans to merge the two divisions onto one trade processing platform The COMEX Division will replace its OnLine Trade Entry OLTE system with the NYMEX Trade Manageme nt System TMS While final details are being determined certain procedural aspects of the transition process can begin Therefore effective immediately the followi ng should be considered Single Sided Concept The source document for TMS will be the trading card Floor staff will collect the original white copies and forward them to the Exchange Trade Da ta Entry area where operators will key the sell side trades The trading card s will no longer be forwarded to the Primary Clearing Members PCMs ins tead they will be retained by the Exchange THIS WILL BEGIN WITH TMS IMPLEMENTATION ON COMEX Each sell side will generate a buy side The brokers staff will be responsible for Account Assignment Trade Checkou t and Corrections in addition for buy side trades it will be necessary to add t he execution time Implementation In accordance with the implementation of TMS members must begin to use new trading card recordation procedures developed to facilitate data input Implementation Schedule The COMEX Division will implement TMS for ALL COMMODITIES in the near futur e WE ASK THAT ALL MEMBERS BEGIN USING THESE RECORDATION PROCEDURES IMMEDIATEL Y to ensure readiness when TMS implementation takes place This will allow members to familiarize themselves with the new recordation procedures and enable the Exchanges Trade Processing staff to review th e handwritingrecordation techniques of the COMEX Divisions membership pr ior to launch During this interim period if necessary staff will contact members regarding their handwriting or lack of adherence to procedures In addition staff will begin to familiarize members clerks with TMS functionality Spread Processing TMS will process all the legs of a spread as one transaction To accomplis h this it is essential for the broker to clearly designate seller status on t he trading card when heshe is the seller of the spread see recordation procedures noted below This indication will inform data entry personnel t o enter the entire spread buy and sell components Opposite buy spreads n ot keyed by the Exchange that are linked to a seller status will be generated by the system NOTE When submitting cards for data entry the differential must be indicated or it will be rejected If the differential is noted without prices for either leg the system will assign the appropriate market pricin g to both legs based on the most recent price reports If the differential i s noted along with the price of one of the legs the system will assign an appropriate price to the other leg Recordation Procedures For the purpose of standardization within the community the following trading card recordation procedures must be used by the brokers ALPHA CODES ONLY TMS does not recognize numeric broker codes therefore use only the appropriate alpha broker codes for trading card recordation and trade processing SPREADS MULTIPLE LEG TRADES Place the value of the spread differential in the bottom portion of each entry lines center field Circle the spread value This will inform da ta entry personnel that the trade is a spread see eg NOTE Failure to place a circled differential in the spread box will result in the entry of the sell leg only as an outright trade Place a slash through the circled differential if you are the buyer of the spread This will inform data entry personnel to ignore the spread see e g Attach a line to either of the above mentioned indicators when a multiple leg spread is involved for example Butterflies this will convey that al l the components are part of one entity see eg CABINET TRADES Place CAB or C in the premium column see eg CONVERSIONS Place the option components on one line The futures component price must be written on the next line across the Strike and Premium columns see eg MATCHED ORDERS Place MO in the price column see eg Trades submitted to the Exchange as MO transactions will initially receive the previous days settlement prices until the current days settleme nt prices are determined and immediately applied EXCHANGE FOR PHYSICAL EFPS Place EFP or E in the SPD box bottom portion of each entry lines center field see eg Crossing of Orders Place a Y in the spread SPD box see eg line A except when crossi ng an EFP at which time the letters EFP must be indicated instead see e g line B Additionally it will not be necessary to denote a Y for cros s trades that require the recordation of a differential Note The clearing information related to a short code that is data entere d by the Exchange will only apply to the sell portion of the cross trade Th e buy side will require subsequent allocation in a typical manner Strip Trades Place the beginning and ending months in the month columns of successive trade lines with the average price indicated in the price column Write STRIP adjacent to the bracketed trade data to highlight the trade type fo r data entry personnel see eg Note The reccommended recordation procedures for various additional types of trades are shown in examples through Short Codes When it is possible the account area on the

AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE October RE Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors The Resolution amends on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM EX ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc The price fluctuation limit rules th at are now in effect for the Exchanges contracts will remain the same for trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours RTH on the trading floor The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday October By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi ng activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with rega rd to trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits would be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts would be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately rather than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During the la st minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market would be halted only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits Finally notwithstanding the changes noted above in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading then the RTH session would ope n with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul e even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM EX ACCESSc trading session If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCES Sc Operations NYMEX ACCESSc Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESSc Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicabl e rule even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM EX ACCESSc trading session Please

to NYMEX ACCESS Effective Sunday evening October trade date October the NYMEX ACCESS electronic trading system will begin offering implied trading functionality pending approval of necessary rule changes by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission This feature will once again create implied bids and offers in all futures intramarket calendar spread and intercommodity spread markets based on orders in related markets Implied Orders in General Implied bids and offers are generated by the system based on individual contract or spread orders that have been entered into the system For example if someone places a spread order to buy heating oil and sell crude oil at a set differential the system will automatically seek the best offe r to sell heating oil and the best bid on crude oil and create an implied bid in heating oil and an implied offer in crude oil based on the differential to the other market To do this the system examines the outright orders orders directly entered into the system and creates bids and offers that are implied by the combination of specific outright orders The system the n creates the implied bid or offer and displays it as an order that may be traded against If a trader trades against this implied order then the outright orders that combined to create the implied order will trade TwoWay Implication Between the Futures and the Spread Markets Orders entered into a commoditys outright futures market will combine t o create implied spread orders both as calendar spreads and intercommodity spreads The reverse is also true ie orders entered into the calendar spread market or the intercommodity spread market ca n combine with other futures orders to create implied futures orders Implied Spread Orders Generated from Other Spread Orders Implied spread orders can be created from the combination of other spread orders For example two separate calendar spread orders one to buy a January contract and sell a February contract and another to buy a Februar y contract and sell a March contract will create an implied order for a buy Januarysell March spread The system will also generate implied intercommodity spread orders from the combination of calendar spread order s and other intercommodity spread orders and it will generate implied calendar spread orders from the combination of intercommodity spread order s and other calendar spread orders Implied Order Creation and the DepthofMarket Implied orders will be displayed only if the implied orders price is th e best price in the market Consequently a particular markets best pric e volume may be composed of outright volume implied volume or a combination of outright and implied volume The depthofmarket view of a contract wil l only show this combination of implied and outright volume at the contract s BEST bid and offer prices Implied orders with prices that are NOT at the best price for a contract will NOT show in the depthofmarket view Please note that although the depthofmarket will not display volume from implied orders at prices other than the best if a sweep order an order to purchase a certain number of contracts within a predetermined price range is entered with a price that would trade through the undisplayed implied orde r the implied order will be filled Color Scheme to Distinguish Between Outright and Implied Orders If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to outright orders then the color will be displayed in BLACK font If the volume of the best bid or offer is due completely to implied orders then the color will be displayed in RED font If the volume of the best bid or offer is a combination then the color will be displayed in PURPLE font Warning Do not change the Bid or Ask Color price cells which is done in the View Preferences Attributes screen to the same colors that appear in the Implied Prices Full and Part fields also located in the same View Preferences Attributes screen If you do you will not be able to view the implied prices Cross Orders Must Be Turned Off The current version of the implied functionality requires that cross order entry be turned off Therefore there is no ability to directly enter a cross order a single order for a trade to be transacted for two customers accounts by the same broker into the NYMEX ACCESSc system This functionality is planned as a future enhancement Orders should be entere d in the order received from the customers If you have two orders in hand that would normally be entered as a cross order you should enter the order received first wait ten seconds and then enter the order received second Options Orders This release does not support implied options orders in any options market More Information If you have additional questions concerning the implied market functionalit y please call the NYMEX ACCESSc Control Center NACC at US UK or Far East The NACC can provide you wi th a more descriptive document concerning the implied functionality and

Calculation of Average Price The weighted mathematical average price shall be computed by FCMs by a multiplying the number of contracts purchased or sold at each execution price by that price b adding the results together and c dividing by the total number of contracts For a series of orders the average price may be computed based on the average price of each order in that series FCMs may confirm to customers either the actual average price or the average price rounded to the next price increment provided however that in confirming the average price rounded to the next price increment the FCM must round the average price up to the next price increment for a buy order or down to the next price increment for a sell order and must pay any residual thus created to the customer except that any residual amount of less than one cent may be retained by the FCM Please click on the link below to indicate you have received this email emailemaillogcfmuseremail refdoc Note If you click on the above

<3121342.1075844462349.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule

Clearing Members FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit Certain Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin for NYMEX and COMEX Transactions DATE June Implementation of Rule Amendments As previously announced in Notice to Members May this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today June that expand the types of noncash assets that customers may deposit with their Clearing Members for margin purposes Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Clearing Members are further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will serve as the authorized uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use on a passthrough basis at the Exchange This form may be obtained from the Exchanges Clearing Department Exchange Form for PassThrough Letters of Credit Specification of Joint Beneficiary The PassThrough Letter of Credit differs from the Standard Letter of Credit in that the PassThrough Letter of Credit provides for Joint Beneficiaries In this regard a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint Beneficiaries By comparison a PassThrough Letter of Credit to be used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit Please note that under applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank bank parent or affiliate bank As to the actual rule amendments which are attached below these rule changes permit the use of letters of credit certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin requirements The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions Letters of Credit As a result of the rule changes letters of credit LCs now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions Use of Letters of Credit on PassThrough Basis In addition the rule changes allow letters of credit to be used on a passthrough basis on both divisions In other words Clearing Members on both divisions will be able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers It should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts as detailed below may be used by customers for margin purposes such assets may not be used on a passthrough basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse Securities Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing Members certain types of securities as margin The types of acceptable securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some time on the COMEX Division Specifically the rule changes will permit customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Members on either division securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange Inc or the American Stock Exchange Inc or which are traded in the overthecounter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board except that such securities must be free

<15306310.1075859978743.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule

system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal Department at or

<19697341.1075860038374.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,exchangeinfo@nymex.com,2000-12-13 07:12:00,Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading NYMEX ACCESSNo December MEMORANDUM TO ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS FROM Neal L Wolkoff Executive Vice President DATE December RE Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app ly to trading on NYMEX ACCESS Resolution remains in effect and will continue until February unless Members are notified otherwise by t he Exchange As background on October the Exchange issued a Notice to Members advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this Resolution The Resolution which became effective with the commencement o f the NYMEX ACCESS session on Sunday October has amended on a temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS The Resolution is included below The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o f the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS the Resolution reduces the possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality The Resolution amends on a temporary basis Exchange price fluctuation lim it rules but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS Thus the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution The Resolution amends the Exchanges price fluctuation limit rules with regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS in four ways The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits are expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac t months for energy contracts or to the first contract month with limits in effect for metals contracts of that futures contract under the applicable rule This expanded limit eg of the limits for the front two months for energy contracts is applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer trading on NYMEX ACCESS generally would be halted immediately rath er than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes During t he last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS session the market would be halt ed only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits As a clarification the Resolution suspends use of certain haircuts narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices Specifically NYMEX Rule Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX ACCESS establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba se point for price limits until the actual settlement prices from the RTH session can be input into the system NYMEX ACCESS will continue to use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution However Rule reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for establishing limits Such haircuts are not being used under the Res olution the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t he Resolution Finally the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange practice In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular Trading Hours RTH trading then the RTH session would open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule This practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution is in effect even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYMEX ACCESS trading session because the market had not hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS As noted these temporary amendments to the Exchanges price limits shal l expire on February unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange If you have any questions please contact Stu Homler Director NYMEX ACCESS Operations NYMEX ACCESS Department at Matt Morano NYMEX ACCESS Department at or Brian Regan Senior Associate General Counsel at APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby Resolves that until further notice the price fluctuation limit rules for each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits for each Exchange futures contract that has such limits shall be expanded to of the initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the applicable rule This expanded limit of the limits for the first two months with limit s shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri ce fluctuation limit trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately except as directed otherwise by the President or the Presidents designe e Following resumption of trading the price limits in effect shall be o f the limits applicable to RTH trading In the event that a limit is touched during the last minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session the market shall be halted briefly and price limits shall be expanded thereafter In addition in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f or five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS session at a price fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session then the RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule

L Wolkoff Executive Vice President RE Rule Changes to Implement enymexsm DATE April DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number o f rule changes which are summarized below to incorporate the implementation of enymexK These rule changes which have been filed with the CFTC and thu s may become effective at any time will be implemented upon the launch of enymexK An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchanges website A hard copy blackline version of the rule changes which shows changes from the current rules can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson at in the Exchanges Legal Department The rule changes include the following areas trading position limits accountability and reporting arbitration Clearing Member obligations and a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access Trading Rules A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the rollou t of enymexK such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX ACCESS and enymexK For example the NYMEX ACCESS error trade rule has been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system EFP and EFS Similarly Rule B and C are the Exchanges rules th at respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded only on NYMEX ACCESS ie electricity futures contracts These rules wi ll now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions Settlement Procedures New NYMEX Rule E enymexK Settlement Price Procedures was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS Thus settlement price s generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee or if t he Settlement Committee was not available by Exchange staff using the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee However one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid or higher than the best offer that a was for at least twentyfive contracts and b had been posted with the Exchange and remained available for execution and unfilled for the final minutes of trading By comparison new NYMEX Rule E contains more general language that would allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and offe rs that would be protected in the settleme nt process Position Limits Accountability and Reporting With regard to the four physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts the amendments to NYMEX Rule s and provide for position accountability in the back months and a spot month limit of contracts for each of these four contracts Also the Exchanges current hedge exemption procedures will be made applicabl e to the enymexK contracts With regard to the cashsettled enymexK contracts t he rule amendments provide for position accountability across all contract months The amendments to Rule establish a reporting level of contracts for each enymexK contract the same reporting level currently use d for many other Exchange contracts However NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cashsettled contracts Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility As to brokerage ne w Rule A enymexK Trading permits brokerage to be done for enyme xK products Section C of new Rule A clarifies that a Clearing Member will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it carries even if there is a system malfunction Arbitration Rules The Exchanges arbitration rules are being amended to reference NonMemb er enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a NonMembe r enymexK User or between NonMember enymexK Users would be subject to Exchan ge arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory basis Summary Disciplinary Procedures The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a NonMember enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system Consistent with this approach new Exchange Rule A establishes a summar y disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action when necessary on an expedited basis Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue to be subject to Exchange rules If you have any questions concerning these rules please contact Christophe r K Bowen Senior Vice President and General Counsel NYMEX Legal Department at or
