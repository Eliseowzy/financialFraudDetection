Jim Fassel the morning after the Monday night disaster and he was blunt about what margin for error his Giants team has after digging itself a fiveloss hole with a stinker at Minnesota None he said We just have to eliminate the little mistakes that are killing us The Giants had their worst penalty game since against the Vikings for yards and put the ball on the ground four times Plus they abandoned the running game too soon What has to be particularly worrisome is the play of Kerry Collins who is an aboveaverage quarterback when he has time to set up and throw but a belowaverage one when feeling pressure Hes now fumbled times in the past five weeks and he has a maddening penchant for taking bad sacks when on the edge of fieldgoal range This game will be an acid test for Oakland too The Raiders are getting gashed on the ground and theyll need to close that floodgate in order to win homefield advantage in the AFC Which in my h umble opinion is crucial You dont want to go to Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game and if the Jets continue to broil you certainly dont want to play at the Meadowlands during the postseason One more note Rich Gannon must be the most consistent quarterback of the century Two picks in a passing offense especially with the running game in drydock What a terrific player I like the Raiders Catch Sports Illustrateds Peter King live from Philadelphia with the latest football news Sunday at am on NFL Preview POWER RANKINGS from SIs Dr Z St Louis Rams Nice try Patriots For a while your changing alignments and imaginative blitz schemes had em scratching their heads but one thing that hasnt been written about this Rams team is its great intelligence on the go Im talking about the ability to make the proper adjustments while things are happening And even when a rusher or two leaks through Warner can get to his hot reads so quickly and accurately that the defense is screwed Pittsburgh Steelers This seems to be the script now People load up to stop Bettis Kordell counterpunches em accurately and effectively Id say that the way he has been playing he rates among the leagues top half dozen or so QBs Of course he has the luxury of a heavy running game behind him Chicago Bears Yeah they beat a firedup Bucs team by throwing long imagine but strategically the end of the game was not indicative of the coachs Yale degree Four straight kneels which stopped the clock and gave the Bucs the ball with left and a chance to tie the game with a final field goal In a similar situation Bill Parcells once had Neil ODonnell pivot and heave the ball into the stands for a deliberate safety Personally I would have had Jim Miller doing a slow jog toward his own end zone far away back back my god whats the blighter doing until either the clock runs out or he has given up the safety and then the Bears get to free kick it with a couple of seconds left The only problem with this strategy is that it ruins your rushing stats for the year For more Power Rankings click here footballnewspowerrankings WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SIs Peter King Im sure Brian Billick will tell his players to put a sock in it theyre all taking jabs at his quarterback but its becoming increasingly apparent that Elvis Grbac cant take the pressure mentally and physically of carrying an offense on his shoulders Too bad Hes a good player But he might be too psychedout now to carry the Ravens to the playoffs Drew Bledsoes future Take this to the bank It wont be in Houston where former trusted Patriots offensive assistant Chris Palmer is the offensive coordinator Bledsoe is too old next season and too immobile for the Texans If the draft were today Houston would select Fresno States David Carr the quarterback with the best longterm chance for success as a passer in this class The change wont be made now nor will it be made in the next week or two But the Chargers cant take many more of those yoyo performances from Doug Flutie They wont hesistate to turn to Drew Brees Norv Turner tells me Brees is the smartest quarterback hes ever been around which is saying something considering hes coached Troy Aikman and Flutie and Trent Green and Jeff Hostetler Click here to send a question to Peter Kings mailbag footballnflnewssubmit UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSIcoms Pat Kirwan Keep an eye on Seahawks defensive back Curtis Fuller The fourthround pick can play corner or safety and against the Bills had eight tackles and two passes defended Mark my words He will continue to get more playing time each week and will emerge as one of the best dime backs in the league by years end Click here for more of Pat Kirwans Unsung Heroes insidegamepatkirwannewsunsungheroes FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSIcoms James Quintong Rod Smith left Sundays game early with his sprained ankle and he might be worth stashing on your bench this week Given the short week because the Broncos will be playing on Thanksgiving Smith may not have time to recover properly and may not be ready to go If that happens you could take a chance on one of the Denver tight ends since the backup receivers dont have much fantasy potential Lamar Smith has been very disappointing in recent weeks averaging only yards per game over his last five outings He has a very favorable matchup this weekend as the Dolphins take on the Bills so he should have a good game If he struggles again it may be time to send him to the bench permanently For more fantasy news and tips click here fantasy BEAT THE EXPERTS Do you think you can Beat the Experts Prove it at CNNSIcom

years ago when Jimmy Johnson was coach of the Dolphins he took a jog near Miamis training facility one day around lunchtime A car drove up next to him The window was rolled down Hey Jimmy the guy driving said J E T S JetsJetsJets Thats the silly chant that reverberates throughout Giants Stadium when the Jets are home Its not something the Dolphins like to hear Miami has made the playoffs in each of the last four seasons but hasnt managed to beat New York in that span And this week things might be more difficult than usual New York gets its firstround pick dangerous speed receiver Santana Moss back to pair opposite Laveranues Coles in threereceiver sets with Wayne Chrebet moving to the slot At the same time rookie Jamar Fletcher replaces the injured Sam Madison at corner for Miami thinning the Dolphins secondary at a very bad time A few weeks ago Zach Thomas told me the New York thing plays on his teams mind With Curtis Mart in running as well as hes been I dont look for that to change this week Jets Catch Sports Illustrateds Peter King live from Miami with the latest football news Sunday at am on NFL Preview POWER RANKINGS from SIs Dr Z St Louis Rams Now it comes out that Kurt Warners sprained thumb is the reason why hes been throwing interceptions And then there was a stretch in which Marshall Faulk was out And still the army moves on Frankly I feel much more comfortable with this team up at the top where it belongs Pittsburgh Steelers They went for the body in the early rounds against the Browns and then when the fight was on the line the sack machine and the Bus moved in for a knockout against a worndown opponent It was classic strongarm football and right now a SteelersRams Super Bowl is an intriguing prospect although Im not predicting it No one wants to make Ravens and Raiders and Dolphins and Bengals and Chiefs fans mad Green Bay Packers I still say their defense is the unsung hero of the drama You can expect the Pack to be up here for a while The toughest part of their schedule is behind them For more Power Rankings click here footballnewspowerrankings WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SIs Peter King If Tennessees lost season isnt in enough trouble quarterback Steve McNair who is nursing about six injuries right now couldnt grip a ball at practice Wednesday and may have to sit out the week Steve Mariucci just cant stand people not liking him which is why his feud with standout receiver Terrell Owens bugs him so much Owens is acting so small in this case Hell never admit hes wrong But the ers simply cannot let this thing fester because were talking about one of the most dangerous players in the game right now Michael Strahan has a bulging disk in his back No worry apparently Hes been playing with it for a couple of years and surgery isnt needed Must not be with sacks in six games The Patriots have no intention of putting Drew Bledsoe back in the lineup anytime soon Would you Tom Brady is and playing more efficiently than Bledsoe has in three years Click here to send a question to Peter Kings mailbag footballnflnewssubmit UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSIcoms Pat Kirwan How about Falcons quarterback Doug Johnson All you hear out of Atlanta is about the battle for playing time between veteran Chris Chandler and top draft pick Michael Vick But it was the littleknown Johnson who threw a late touchdown and ran the offense for the winning score against the Cowboys Johnson was an undrafted free agent out of Florida in In limited action as a rookie he completed of passes and threw two touchdowns but until Sunday he hadnt yet been involved in a winning pro effort Click here for more of Pat Kirwans Unsung Heroes insidegamepatkirwannewskirwanunsungheroes FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSIcoms James Quintong After a slow start Washingtons Stephen Davis has been on a roll averaging just under yards per game over his last four games improving his rushing total in each of those four contests Hell face a tough Denver defense thats allowing just yards per game but Davis is a good enough runner to overcome that Arizonas David Boston is one of the surprise fantasy performers of the year leading the league with an average of yards per game receiving However he has just one touchdown a big letdown given all of his yardage production Boston could have a great chance to get a couple of touchdowns under his belt this weekend

Giants at Philadelphia Sunday What a difference a drive makes Entering Week this year at Giants Stadium the Giants had won nine in a row over the Eagles And after minutes of that October game one of the dullest in recent NFL history New York had a lead Donovan McNabb could do nothing Then he led a very unepic yard drive found James Thrash for an yard touchdown and the Eagles had broken the schneid with a win That one drive does not convince me the Giants still dont have the Eagles number These teams have changed very little except at receiver for Philadelphia since the Giants went by a margin of points over the Eagles in The key Sunday will be whether Kerry Collins can make five or six plays The Giants need to score or points to win because their secondary is susceptible to some McNabb playmaking And because the weather wont be a factor and the game should be determined on the merits of the players alo ne I like Michael Strahan and Keith Hamilton to combine for three sacks Tiki Barber to churn out somehow total yards and Collins to make a play or two in the fourth quarter New York Catch Sports Illustrateds Peter King live from Giants Stadium with the latest football news Sunday at am on NFL Preview POWER RANKINGS from SIs Dr Z St Louis A very interesting shift in philosophy occurred during the week Mike Martz lifted the punt receiving duties from AzZahir Hakim who keeps both sides in the game You never know whether hell pop one or drop one and Martz now says hell trade excitement for steadiness ie Dre Bly Could this also mean as the playoffs loom that hell try to get Kurt Warner to go a little more conservative in order to cut down on the picks two against the Panthers bringing his seasons total to highest in the NFC I dont think so but I didnt think hed ground Hakim either Pittsburgh I almost made the Men of Steel my No this week after their huge win Sunday But hey it was against Detroit OK we all know that the true No will be determined only after Super Bowl XXXVI and all this stuff is just window dressing but I will be monitoring the last two contests of both the Rams and Steelers very closely to see which team really deserves the annual prize award Whats the prize Well Ill be damned if itll be a trip to Disneyland Chicago Raiders fans youre gonna have to wait your turn and its going to take longer than youd like The Bears made a valiant comeback on a typical weekafterclinching downer while Oakland was taking its lumps from the Titans Chicago earned this position And I hope this serves as an adequate response to all the email heat I know Im going to receive For more Power Rankings click here footballnewspowerrankings WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SIs Peter King Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver sees the chinks in Tom Coughlins armor He knows some players hate their head coach and that the organization has been beaten down by him But Weaver also sees a coach whos gotten a lot out of his thinning talent over the past couple of years Thats why I see Weaver extending Coughlins contract two or three years after this season and allowing him to preside over the tearing down and reconstruction of the franchise That will take a solid three years The Rams are trying hard to get London Fletchers contract done before he hits free agency Hes more valuable to St Louis than he would be to most teams and they cant afford to lose him if that defense hopes to continue to play so well next season I can promise you that Mike Shanahan is staying in Denver Promise Ive never been as sure of anything in my years covering this game I keep hearing Notre Dame is keeping the seat warm for Jon Gruden Click here to send a question to Peter Kings mailbag footballnflnewssubmit UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSIcoms Pat Kirwan The Tampa Bay Bucs finally looked like the offense that was advertised last spring when they acquired Brad Johnson Its amazing what adversity will do and how the offense had to get away from the conservative just dont lose the game mentality when the possibility of missing the playoffs was an issue Offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen got a chance to open it up and the end result was offensive points against a tough Saints team Click here for more of Pat Kirwans Unsung Heroes insidegamepatkirwannewskirwanunsung FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSIcoms James Quintong Trung Canidate could be worth a start as a second or third running back in the last couple of games if the Rams build up big early leads in their last two games which is entirely possible with home games against the Colts and Falcons Marshall Faulk should still put up big numbers but could be rested if games get out of hand early giving Canidate plenty of chances to shine Jerome Bettis may actually see some playing time this week but dont look for him to make much of a fantasy impact The Steelers pretty much have homefield advantage throughout the playoffs already locked up and theres no real reason for Bettis to see a lot of action

the Green BayChicago rivalry Ill never forget the time back in covering BearsPackers at Lambeau when I followed the Chicago team buses from Appleton about minutes away to the stadium on Sunday morning As the convoy passed a farm two kids began beating a large stuffed bear hung in effigy from a tree in full view of the buses How about that The kids knew they were the Bears buses They knew about when theyd be passing And they put on a great show Somehow I think the intensity might be as good this weekend at Soldier Field The Bears will send the house in the form of Rosevelt Colvin Brian Urlacher Philip Daniels and Bryan Robinson at Brett Favre for four quarters Ahman Green will have to rise to the occasion and take some pressure off Favre by running the ball effectively Chicago had allowed but two sacks all season until last week when Courtney Brown got three for the Browns and I look for the Pack aiming for the NFL sack record with ru shers who have come from nowhere to make life hard for the Chicago passing game Key to the game Simple Ballpossession by the Pack If Favre and Green can lead four or five long clockeating drives the Bears wont be able to make the magic theyve made the past two weeks Catch Sports Illustrateds Peter King live from Cleveland with the latest football news Sunday at am on NFL Preview POWER RANKINGS from SIs Dr Z Oakland Raiders Their offense looked like a military drill team Monday night Defensively well I still cant figure out why allpro cornerback Charles Woodson who left the field with a turf toe made cameo appearances thereafter but not when the Broncos drove deep I mean hes either hurt or hes not hurt or maybe there were times when the painkiller wore off and he was waiting for the new shot to kick in Odd eh St Louis Rams Their bye coupled with the Steelers loss occasioned this position switch Memo to potential Mailbaggers Any moaning about this will produce exactly the same comment as you just read unless you threaten me personally and then Ill attack your grammatical structure Pittsburgh Steelers The offensive line held firm and the Ravens rushers hardly got a sniff of Kordell which was why I believe he put up good numbers I was particularly impressed with the job that former taxi squadder Oliver Ross subbing for injured Wayne Gandy at LT did against Michael McCrary With help of course Always with help For more Power Rankings click here footballnewspowerrankings WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW by SIs Peter King Just curious if Jets safety Damian Robinson would have gotten a games suspension instead of just a fine if hed done what it looked like he was trying to do the other night which was attempting to break Aaron Brooks neck Weak penalty NFL Very weak The Redskins love Fresno State quarterback David Carr The Redskins do not love Tony Banks who hasnt fully learned Washingtons offensive playbook Itll be interesting to see if the Redskins keep winning how much theyll trade to move up to get a quarterback near the top of the first round of the draft The Ravens wish Elvis Grbac were tougher Mike Holmgren has a real decision on his hands To show his team hes trying to do everything he can to win now Trent Dilfer has to be his quarterback Sunday against Oakland not the erratic Matt Hasselbeck even though Im a proponent of Hasselbeck getting experience now Click here to send a question to Peter Kings mailbag footballnflnewssubmit UNSUNG HEROES by CNNSIcoms Pat Kirwan Im not surprised that rookie free agent running back Dominic Rhodes has filled in for Edgerrin James in an exceptional way Last week in a win over Buffalo Rhodes rushed for yards and caught four passes for yards I spent a considerable amount of time with Rhodes last winter and I was amazed that so many NFL teams really didnt know about this kid Rhodes was a high school legend in Texas before he enrolled at Midwestern Texas State If he had gone to Texas or AM he might have been a secondround pick Its a tribute to Bill Polian who uncovered the back and got him without using a draft pick Believe me Rhodes wont be a backup his whole career either Click here for more of Pat Kirwans Unsung Heroes insidegamepatkirwannewsunsungheroes FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK by CNNSIcoms James Quintong While the Jets defense can be prone to giving up lots of yards they are definitely among the top fantasy defenses by the sheer number of turnovers theyve forced The Jets defense has picked off passes and forced fumbles this year both great fantasy numbers Its something to look out for if youve got a turnoverprone player taking on the Jets in upcoming weeks After sitting out the past couple of weeks with a knee injury Marshall Faulk is healthy and ready to go for the Rams Go ahead and activate him as he has a favorable matchup at home against a Carolina team thats ranked next to last in total defense For more fantasy news and tips click here fantasy BEAT THE EXPERTS Do you think you can Beat
