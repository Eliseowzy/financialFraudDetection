ISO several of us were successful in communicating the need for a more diverse Market Repair Team that would include perhaps some additional members and a Stakeholder Advisory Committee We were also successful in communicating our costbenefit analysis and delaying the immediate adoption of the team The motion approved read Board of Governors Market Repair Team MOVED that the Board approve the concept of a Market Repair Team along the lines described in the Florio memorandum of March and directs ISO management to provide a response to the proposal addressing among other issues issues of cost benefit conflicts of interest team composition at the next Board meeting IEP CMUA SMUD and Grid Services were all asked to submit some proposed names by today to the ISO Management please see below email from Elaina Today during the Public Comment you all indicated that you might have names as potential members of the Advisory Group for the Market Repair Team It is not clear at this point how the whole process will be structured but we have been asked to put together a proposed game plan including names for potential members of the Advisory Group Please send them to me ask quickly as you can Friday pm is what Chairman Kahn asked for We would like to be as responsive as possible to the request and have thought of the idea of proposing someone that EPSA uses in a variety of roles CMUA will also probably be proposing someone from their national organization The name that has been suggested for IEP to submit is Craig Roach of Boston Pacific consulting who has done extensive work for EPSA in supporting a competitive market policy There is more information on Dr Roach and Boston Consulting on their web site wwwbostonpacificcom I spoke with Julie Simon at EPSA this morning and she also gave him an enthusiastic endorsement Another idea or an additional person to submit would be an economist that is involved heavily in California Since both Hogan and Joskow have financial ties to market participants we may want to consider proposing our own economist It is the plan to submit both names to the ISO as well as a letter addressing the following Raise very gently the issue of potential conflict of interest coupled with costbenefit analysis etc Address structural issues including how stakeholders will participate Propose more diversity for the Market Repair Team Propose a Stakeholder Advisory Group as a third box and include stakeholders including a regional perspective like neighboring control areas and folks with operational and market experience It is crucial that if this plan sends up any red flags for you that you get back to me ASAP I will be sending this letter to the ISO this afternoon after we get the logistics worked out IF you have problems with this direction please supply additional names we can route with the group I have talked to a few companies that were at the meeting yesterday and they are comfortable but wanted to make sure everyone had a

had a live Satellite feedbroadcast state wideoutside the governors office at the end of the press conference in which NBC ABC CBS CNN Fox and several of their local LA Bay Area affiliates as well as most of the Capitol Press Core including the Wall Street Journal Sacramento BEE LA Times Bloomberg SF Chronicle SJ Mercury News AP and others WE will keep you posted of others Just a reminder we will also be holding a press availability tomorrow at am in which we will be discussing further IEPs reaction to the Governors Press Conference and other events in the Legislature this week As always we will keep you posted Katie Kaplan FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS DELIVERS ADDRESS TO CALIFORNIANS ON ENERGY SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today delivered an important live address on energy from his office in Sacramento The following are his remarks as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became Governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be and a half percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise and a half percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability If they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers

<3897811.1075843016641.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kaplan@iepa.com,2000-11-02 06:18:00,FW Davis Press Release on FERB ReportDAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison

Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by

<28805210.1075843137676.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,kaplan@iepa.com,2000-11-02 06:18:00,FW Davis Press Release on FERB ReportDAVIS COMMENTS ON FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSIONS REPORT The following is a transcript of Governor Gray Davis remarks on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions FERC report My goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricity affordable That is more of a challenge than you might imagine in this complicated deregulated world we find ourselves in I believe we are making a good start Last year I was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates in San Diego and I supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewable power resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to support financially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programs up and down the state to reduce Californias use of electricity by when we had a Stage Two alert and to encourage demand management programs by a number of industries including the technology and grocery industry that reduce the demand on any given day Having said all that this market is dysfunctional It is a very difficult environment for deregulation to work And I repeat again deregulation can work but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market is competitive which it is not I was pleased to see that Secretary Richardson agrees with me that this market is dysfunctional and I am also somewhat pleased by the initial reports of the action that FERC took today It is a mixed blessing They do recognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agree that the rates are not just or reasonable However they did not as I encouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San Diego who were literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation that San Diego had to suffer through FERC also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the ISOindependent service operator and the power exchange FERC agrees with me that they are selfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in market manipulation However it is unclear what will replace those boards The good news is that they agree with our premise that the market is dysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust The bad news is there is no immediate remedy for ratepayers here in California I believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but I am not going to be a prisoner of ideology I do not want some knee jerk reactions to drive our economy or our consumers to their knees I have seen time and again the most right wing conservatives in San Diego that say please give us money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended upon us So as I have long understood economics drives politics and at the moment we are shipping about billion more out of this state for electricity than we paid about months ago That has got to stop Question inaudible It appears that the FERC said they are going to restructure it and this again suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with Once the state deregulated distribution from power generation in the PUC basically surrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition of electricity for California and that control reverted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission As I read the initial reports from the FERC decision today they are saying the ISO and the power exchange are dominated by stake holder members and they think that is ill advised as do I There will be new boards established and we will tell you how they are established So it is unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the FERC to establish our own ISO and power exchange My initial reading of the press reports suggest that we may not That is something that has to be cleared up over the next several days Question inaudible We have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds of stakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groups from San Diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicate the path that we will take I am not at the point where I can tell you what that consensus is But we are making progress Question inaudible That we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear the full brunt of this experiment in deregulation At best it was premature and the market place was not prepared The marketplace is dysfunctional it is not competitive There is a far greater demand for electricity than we can generate in this state I want them to know that we are working night and day to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigs for this illconceived scheme I am pleased that FERC has recognized that the marketplace is dysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable I am not pleased that they have not offered any solutions It looks like we are going to have to wait until November th at the hearing in front of FERC at which their full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to comment critique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adopted in full or in part This is a very important meeting in which our administration will be fully represented and I hope to be able to inform the consumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if not before I believe refunds are due and necessary FERC and the Secretary of Energy have concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just and reasonable and I believe that FERC has the power to order refunds It is unclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not Congress could settle the question by simply passing legislation to ensure that Over the long haul by that I mean to to years I believe deregulation can work but only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties act responsibly As I told everyone involved in this process some people may win the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer and citizen of this state The people of California will stand up they will rise up and take matters into their own hands The problem with deregulation lowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on the immediate horizon Question inaudible Let me just say two things I think there is plenty of blame to go around but there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstate companies are charging us to more for the very same electricity that we purchased last year You cannot add value to an electron An electron is an electron They are simply taking advantage of an illadvised scheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear I am standing up and saying no more We are not going to take this lying down We are fighting back The difficulty is that we do not have the power that we used to have The state surrendered a lot of that power when Governor Wilson signed the deregulation bill Actually carried by Jim Brulte and co authored by Steve Peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy well maybe not so happy to acknowledge It may have seemed like a good idea in but I did not participate in that debate and I dont have a comment on whether it was a good idea then But clearly in the year it is not a good idea Again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have some limited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to the generators which is about of their facilities that they used to own and we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the out of state generators that purchased them FERC has control over them and it is unclear whether we even have control to establish our own ISO and our own power exchange and if we did I would have them reconstituted There is no question about that They are too self serving too inbred and too incestuous and do not represent consumer interests Plus you cannot hold anyone accountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards You cannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price of electricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state So these are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and no public official participates on those boards Question inaudible You are more right than wrong As the chief executive of this state I am going to advocate what I believe is in the best interests of our consumers and businesses Electricity is the lifeblood of our economy Without water and electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luck Whether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is a question not worth debating today But it does not make sense today Unfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor Wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the PUC used to monitor and supervise So it is unclear how much power is left to the state FERC seems to be suggesting today not much Obviously as governor of this state I want to assert as much authority as I possibly can because I know I will be held accountable and obviously I would like the authority to go along with the responsibility that is laid at my doorstep I have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lights stay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and the prices are reasonable What path we take to that matters less to me than that we get to that result Because that is the result that is necessary to allow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make a profit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turn provides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect the environment and provide healthcare Without electricity there is no economic growth without economic growth we do not have the resources to do justice to our public obligations

Inc LOS ANGELES Dow JonesEdison International EIX saying the current state of Californias power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy will call Wednesday for an end to Californias fouryear experiment with deregulation sources familiar with the issue told Dow Jones Newswires John Bryson chief executive of Edison International is expected to announce that the companys regulated utility unit Southern California Edison wont be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the states deregulated market structure is scrapped In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation Edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and reenter the powergeneration business Southern California Edison was required to exit under the states landmark deregulation law the sources said Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as the sources said even though regulators rejected Edisons request for a rate increase of last week The utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal which would require action by the state legislature the sources said Southern California Edison with million customers is one of the countrys largest electric utilities Edison was the first of the states utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and as it says on its Web site played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in California Among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses Edisons current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers About half of those losses are offset the utilitys own power sales revenues which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulationrelated debt Rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account Edison wouldnt reveal the current size of the surplus but said previously that the California Power Exchange paid the utility billion over its generating costs for power through the end of September at a time when its powerpurchase losses were billion PowerPurchase Losses Mounting The net losses continue to mount Californias wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks as colder weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of Californias power supply was down for maintenance The price of power for delivery Wednesday in California hit an average of a megawatthour Tuesday up from a megawatthour a week ago the result of high demand and a decision by Californias wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices The rate Southern California Edison can charge its retail customers however is fixed at MWh Last week Merrill Lynch Co MER downgraded its ratings for Edison International and PGE Corp PCG the parent of Californias other major utility Pacific Gas Electric to neutral saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesnt allow them to raise their retail rates A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter MDW analyst drew the same conclusion Monday also cutting his rating to neutral Edison to this point has kept its powerpurchase losses off its earnings statement in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later The California Public Utilities Commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week however when it ruled against rate increases sought by Edison and PGE Credit rating agency Fitch Inc on Monday lowered its ratings for Edison International and Southern California Edisons senior unsecured debt to the Aminus level citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities ability to recover the costs of their power purchases The agency downgraded Edison International the parent because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by Southern California Edison Edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months California paid more than billion for power last week sources said Some of that however was paid to Southern California Edison

Expedited Approval By California Energy Commission Monday December pm Source Dow Jones Operation Targeted for August IRVINE Calif Dec PRNewswire Edison Mission Energy EME an Edison International company NYSE EIX started construction of its new Sunrise power plant on Thursday December having received expedited approval from the California Energy Commission CEC to proceed The power generation facility will be located in Kern County California and will bring both short and longterm generation capacity to the state which is in dire need of new power generation From the onset of the California power crisis we have sought to find means to bring new power to the California market said John E Bryson chairman and CEO of Edison International This CEC approval will help ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant amount of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August Our thanks and appreciation go to the California Energy Commission and the environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this important project This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing for it does not depend on Californias broken deregulated power market said Alan J Fohrer president and CEO of EME Alternatively EME will seek to enter into a longterm costbased contract with either Pacific Gas Electric Company or San Diego Gas Electric Company to further ensure that Californias consumers reap the benefit of this additional power resource Fohrer said The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases Phase will consist of a megawatt MW simplecycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service during the summer Phase will convert the peaking facility to a MW combinedcycle operation with an inservice date of summer The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental and safety standards Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project only EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II expansion in line with the fasttrack approval process recently enacted by the California legislature EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated construction schedule The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this additional power to California by

had a live Satellite feedbroadcast state wideoutside the governors office at the end of the press conference in which NBC ABC CBS CNN Fox and several of their local LA Bay Area affiliates as well as most of the Capitol Press Core including the Wall Street Journal Sacramento BEE LA Times Bloomberg SF Chronicle SJ Mercury News AP and others WE will keep you posted of others Just a reminder we will also be holding a press availability tomorrow at am in which we will be discussing further IEPs reaction to the Governors Press Conference and other events in the Legislature this week As always we will keep you posted Katie Kaplan FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS DELIVERS ADDRESS TO CALIFORNIANS ON ENERGY SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today delivered an important live address on energy from his office in Sacramento The following are his remarks as prepared for delivery Good evening Im speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing California our energy crisis Simply stated we have two problems supply is too low and costs are too high Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in But no matter how we got into this mess you hired me to solve problems And thats what Im doing The only longterm solution is to build more power plants We must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities But prices wont fall and supply wont be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume Yet in the years before I took office not a single major power plant was built in California Not one Since I became Governor weve licensed major power plants Ten more are in the pipeline And were doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies The generators are free to charge whatever they want because theyre governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices This past winter the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy In January with the feds still refusing to do their job California stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy We didnt take over to save the utilities We took over to keep the power on and the economy strong Thats not all We also negotiated longterm contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices I used my emergency powers to seize control of lowcost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators We began negotiations to buy the utilities transmission system We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants Were launching an million conservation program Were moving to establish a public power authority to build more power If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs well build them ourselves And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us off were using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct We cant fix years of inaction overnight But were making real progress Now as you know I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates Its become increasingly clear however that with rising natural gas prices the feds failure to control costs and the states lack of supply that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive rate hikes So Im urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back Under my proposal more than half of you wont pay a penny more For the rest the average increase will be and a half percent For many of that group rates will rise only about percent The heaviest users will see their rates rise and a half percent on average That includes business paying their share This is in addition to the percent surcharge weve all been paying since last winter But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation Heres the point The more you use the more you pay The more you conserve the more you save Conservation is our best shortterm weapon against blackouts and pricegouging By flexing your power youll help secure our energy future Unlike the PUC my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to financial stability If they agree to three main conditions They must provide lowcost regulated power to the state for years Agree to sell us their transmission system And dismiss their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates My proposal raises rates fairly assures us of longterm power stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation Our emphasis on conservation is critical In order to make it through the summer we must cut demand by at least percent Already weve launched programs to cut back commercial lighting and reduce consumption in office buildings schools and government facilities Friends we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless We are million strong and if each of us does our part we can minimize disruptions and get through the summer We are Californians Weve withstood earthquakes floods fires and droughts Yes this mess is manmade but with your help and Gods blessing well get through this as well Thank you and good night Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers

Lynch is having a press conference right now in which she has outlined the decisions that will come before the commission tomorrow We are listening in and trying to get our hands on the materials When we get them we will send them out The four items are Order the IOUs to pay the QFs going forward starting April a Treatment of payments would modify i Shift the index from Topck because it has been gammed it will be moved to Malin which is lower ii Heat rate OM may be addressed through workshops iii Withdrawing for long term fixed price proposal b Legislation solution has broken down and this is why they must act c Woods proposed decision due out today He indicates most QFs do not need to withhold and it is difficult to tell This withholding by the QFs resulted in the recent blackouts Instruct the IOUs to pay CDWR for all past due amounts in which they have purchased for the IOUs net short position based on a formula by amount of energy purchased specified dollar amount it is unclear what this is As a result of increasing power prices Lynch proposes to increase residential and commercial rates by cents per KWh This will not be voted upon tomorrow and this proposal will jump start the process a This will not affect all the CARE customers and anyone who uses under of baseline If you use under of baseline the increase is only b Authorization to collect more will begin

ISO several of us were successful in communicating the need for a more diverse Market Repair Team that would include perhaps some additional members and a Stakeholder Advisory Committee We were also successful in communicating our costbenefit analysis and delaying the immediate adoption of the team The motion approved read Board of Governors Market Repair Team MOVED that the Board approve the concept of a Market Repair Team along the lines described in the Florio memorandum of March and directs ISO management to provide a response to the proposal addressing among other issues issues of cost benefit conflicts of interest team composition at the next Board meeting IEP CMUA SMUD and Grid Services were all asked to submit some proposed names by today to the ISO Management please see below email from Elaina Today during the Public Comment you all indicated that you might have names as potential members of the Advisory Group for the Market Repair Team It is not clear at this point how the whole process will be structured but we have been asked to put together a proposed game plan including names for potential members of the Advisory Group Please send them to me ask quickly as you can Friday pm is what Chairman Kahn asked for We would like to be as responsive as possible to the request and have thought of the idea of proposing someone that EPSA uses in a variety of roles CMUA will also probably be proposing someone from their national organization The name that has been suggested for IEP to submit is Craig Roach of Boston Pacific consulting who has done extensive work for EPSA in supporting a competitive market policy There is more information on Dr Roach and Boston Consulting on their web site wwwbostonpacificcom I spoke with Julie Simon at EPSA this morning and she also gave him an enthusiastic endorsement Another idea or an additional person to submit would be an economist that is involved heavily in California Since both Hogan and Joskow have financial ties to market participants we may want to consider proposing our own economist It is the plan to submit both names to the ISO as well as a letter addressing the following Raise very gently the issue of potential conflict of interest coupled with costbenefit analysis etc Address structural issues including how stakeholders will participate Propose more diversity for the Market Repair Team Propose a Stakeholder Advisory Group as a third box and include stakeholders including a regional perspective like neighboring control areas and folks with operational and market experience It is crucial that if this plan sends up any red flags for you that you get back to me ASAP I will be sending this letter to the ISO this afternoon after we get the logistics worked out IF you have problems with this direction please supply additional names we can route with the group I have talked to a few companies that were at the meeting yesterday and they are comfortable but wanted to make sure everyone had a
