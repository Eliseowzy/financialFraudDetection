a little patience and a softbristled push broom After youve poured the concrete in the patch hole and worked the surface smooth with a wood float wait around as it dries this is the part that requires patience When the new patch has hardened enough so that its tough to put a dent in the surface with your finger spray a fine mist of water over the top and gently scrub away the surface cream with your soft broom until the aggregate appears If the old concrete shows larger aggregate youll have to scrub harder to match it To take the fresh white color out of your patch trying washing the surface with a little cola after it has hardened for a day Odd as it sounds the acidic nature of the soft drink often does the trick Have a helpful tip Wed love to hear about it and maybe share it with our
