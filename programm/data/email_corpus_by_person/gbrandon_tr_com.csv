Public Utility Control has released a draft decision to grant a request by Southern New England Telephone Co and its video service subsidiary SNET Personal Vision Inc to exit the cable TV business in Connecticut The draft decision concludes that the department doesnt have the statutory authority to require SNET to continue providing service It says the department also lacks the authority to force the transfer of SNETs franchise or video assets to another company Last August SNET requested permission to abandon its cable TV franchise after finding that it couldnt turn a profit selling video service over its hybrid fiber coaxial HFC network In September Connecticut Telephone Communications Systems Inc CTTEL asked the department to transfer SNETs cable TV franchise to CTTEL and also proposed the transfer of SNETs hybrid fiber coaxial network to Connecticut Telephone am The DPUCs draft decision notes that the forced transfer of SNETs modified franchise agreement would violate level playing field requirements in the states cable TV law In the DPUC modified SNETs franchise to give it time to find a way to continue providing video service Standard cable TV franchises require companies to construct their systems to serve an entire franchise territory and to serve multiple dwelling units According to the draft decision the DPUC couldnt transfer SNETs modified franchise to CTTEL without running afoul of the level playing field requirement Regarding the HFC network the draft decision accepts SNETs position that aside from coaxial cable and some videoonly portions of the network theres no cable TV network to transfer to a third party and no pole attachment rights to provide It says that any such action by the department would almost certainly invoke claims of taking The decision would strongly urge SNET to make its videorelated network elements available to cable TV providers either by tariff or special arrangement that would advance the competitive provisioning of video services including considering requests by providers of video services to colocate facilities Joe Mazzarella CTTELs president told TR his company is encouraged by the departments apparent commitment to ensuring that SNET provides cable TV companies nondiscriminatory access to its video network elements Still Mazzarella said CTTEL likely will file written exceptions to the draft before a final version is adopted The draft decision also would modify SNETs exit plan to make the cessation of operations as fair and as nondisruptive as possible to its customers It would order SNET to credit each subscriber to defray the expense of connecting to another video provider SNET had offered to pay SNET would have to provide two separate notices to notify each customer of the last day of service and how to contact their incumbent cable TV provider The department said it would accept SNETs proposal to fund its community access providers for one additional year Written exceptions to the

Public Utility Control has released a draft decision to grant a request by Southern New England Telephone Co and its video service subsidiary SNET Personal Vision Inc to exit the cable TV business in Connecticut The draft decision concludes that the department doesnt have the statutory authority to require SNET to continue providing service It says the department also lacks the authority to force the transfer of SNETs franchise or video assets to another company Last August SNET requested permission to abandon its cable TV franchise after finding that it couldnt turn a profit selling video service over its hybrid fiber coaxial HFC network In September Connecticut Telephone Communications Systems Inc CTTEL asked the department to transfer SNETs cable TV franchise to CTTEL and also proposed the transfer of SNETs hybrid fiber coaxial network to Connecticut Telephone am The DPUCs draft decision notes that the forced transfer of SNETs modified franchise agreement would violate level playing field requirements in the states cable TV law In the DPUC modified SNETs franchise to give it time to find a way to continue providing video service Standard cable TV franchises require companies to construct their systems to serve an entire franchise territory and to serve multiple dwelling units According to the draft decision the DPUC couldnt transfer SNETs modified franchise to CTTEL without running afoul of the level playing field requirement Regarding the HFC network the draft decision accepts SNETs position that aside from coaxial cable and some videoonly portions of the network theres no cable TV network to transfer to a third party and no pole attachment rights to provide It says that any such action by the department would almost certainly invoke claims of taking The decision would strongly urge SNET to make its videorelated network elements available to cable TV providers either by tariff or special arrangement that would advance the competitive provisioning of video services including considering requests by providers of video services to colocate facilities Joe Mazzarella CTTELs president told TR his company is encouraged by the departments apparent commitment to ensuring that SNET provides cable TV companies nondiscriminatory access to its video network elements Still Mazzarella said CTTEL likely will file written exceptions to the draft before a final version is adopted The draft decision also would modify SNETs exit plan to make the cessation of operations as fair and as nondisruptive as possible to its customers It would order SNET to credit each subscriber to defray the expense of connecting to another video provider SNET had offered to pay SNET would have to provide two separate notices to notify each customer of the last day of service and how to contact their incumbent cable TV provider The department said it would accept SNETs proposal to fund its community access providers for one additional year Written exceptions to the

business in nondiscriminatory ways with regard to CLECs Immediately following the laws effective date the BPU would have to order full testing of the ILECs operations support systems OSSs The board couldnt certify an OSS as functional unless the testing unequivocally demonstrated that it met the same standards as required for systems used for switched interexchange service The OSS would have to pass a day commercial availability test before certification After the initial hearing switched access rates would have to be reduced to cost Unless cost data supported higher rates the BPU would have to set access rates at no higher than per minute for local switching charges and per minute for originating and terminating nontrafficsensitive switched usage rates Another provision of the bill deems local calls to Internet service provider to be local calls for reciprocal compensation purposes The bill aims to protect consumers by directing the BPU to establish a universal service fund USF that

condition The URC gave final approval however to the tariffs rates and charges The URC said its concerned that a tariff containing finally approved terms and conditions may become not only the minimum conditions for interconnection but also the maximum conditions any CLEC can negotiate We believe this result would improperly limit future negotiations between incumbent local exchange carriers and CLECs to limit the choice available under section of the federal Telecommunications Act of The commission said it isnt sure how an interconnection agreement and an interconnection service arrangement
