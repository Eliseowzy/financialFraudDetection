Barbe Robin Concannon Ruth Goodell Scott Jones David Kaiser Jared Loving Scott Bates Kimberly Muhl Gil Smith Maureen Smith Shauywn Taylor Craig Willis Jim Tucker Patrick McCaffrey Deirdre Penman Gregg Kinsey Lisa Brady Kevin Pendergrass Cora Subject Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call Here are my notes from todays call As with Monday Ive focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to reorganize them by subject Enrons business has been grouped into three buckets Core Noncore and Under Review Core Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe retail energy pipelines Noncore Broadband water and international assets ie EGAS Enron has approx Bn in investments in these assets and they have produced dismal returns Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets Under Review EGM EIM These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of longterm viability Required resource levels are being carefully studied Following review Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or noncore as the analysis dictates Approximately MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter These include a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica and our Indian EP assets Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of MMBn Given the current environment raising equity in the public markets would be inefficient McMahon says Shortterm liquidity is provided by the Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago the Bn of new debt and the Bn equity infusion from Dynegy Longerterm the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt McMahon described the major offbalancesheet vehicles Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets It was initially capitalized with MM of a debt and MM of equity raised from Enron and institutional investors The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix assets Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on the Enron topup obligation The date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated belowinvestmentgrade by any one of the three major agencies The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water As long as Wessex is worth at least Bn there will be no Enron topup required If we take a haircut to present book value Enron will have to provide MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt This MM would hit Enron cash income and equity balances Osprey contains energyrelated assets and other assets It was initially capitalized with Bn of a debt and MM in equity ENE and institutionals As with Marlin the entity is an assetbacked structure with an Enron topup guarantee The debt is supported by a the assets b Bn of convertible preferred ENE convertible into MM shares of ENE common and c additional ENE common as needed for topup Assuming the same hypothetical haircut to current book value Enron would have to deliver approx MM of topup fundswhich would hit ENE cash income and equity The debt must be retired by with the same cuttojunk early trigger provision as Marlin Yosemite and the CreditLinked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with large financial institutions The underlying transactions are already on Enrons balance sheet McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles McMahon says Our Q will be filed five days late The Q will include all of this detail regarding the offbalancesheet vehicles The special committee investigation is still ongoing The committee meets timesweek sometimes more often The outside auditors DT and external counsel hired by the committee are working virtually days a week Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation McMahon says its way too early to tell if any asset writedowns are called for That analysis is underway but it will not be complete for some time Osprey contains the European power projects Trakya and Saarlux some North American merchant investments and some Brazilian assets Under the merger agreement Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval However an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval Broadband is expected to be fully wound up sometime over the course of the next year Did not catch this part clearly The ENE topup obligation for Marlin represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level Current book value of the Osprey assets is Bn No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the Bn legal liability clause Yosemite and the CreditLinked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt this section somewhat unclear The underlying transactions represented volumes of crude oil and gas The transactions relate to the physical movement of these commodities The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longerterm products Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put longterm deals on hold last week Says that our first focus is on getting our shortterm business back up to normal levels It will be a couple of weeks before were able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding longterm deals with us McMahon There hasnt been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customerscredit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers But we have seen a return of some of the transactions some of the flows Whalley says that were hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure he says The cuts will certainly be deeper in our noncore businesses Whalley then quickly interjects some might say interrrupts with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business We will be looking at perhaps streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business McMahon The company is overlevered thats a facthence our pursuit of additional equity McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week ENE had approx Bn in cash as of which McMahon points out would be unusual for us As before give me a call at if youd like more color Patrick Tucker
