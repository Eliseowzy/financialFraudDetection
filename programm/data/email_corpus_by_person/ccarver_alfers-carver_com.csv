<6235067.1075842605206.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,ccarver@alfers-carver.com,2000-08-02 10:15:00,RE Summary of Tom Brown MeetingThanks for the info Very interesting Sounds to me like Wildhorse wont be acknowledging unprofitability any time soon That would reduce the amount of gas committed to the contract and even if it doesnt actually want to transport that gas at the contract price Wildhorse will have even less desire to admit in advance of a sale that its committed reserves have been declining drastically Your letter will however throw an interesting new element into the Tom BrownKinder Morgan discussions Wouldnt it be fun to see how these partners go about handling formulation of a response Craig Original Message From Gerald Nemec mailto Sent Wednesday August PM To Subject Re Summary of Tom Brown Meeting Craig FYI Some internal discussions Forwarded by Gerald NemecHOUECT on PM Gerald Nemec PM To Dan J NRON cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Barbara Gray Teresa G CT Subject Re Summary of Tom Brown MeetingDocument link Gerald Nemec Confidential Work Product Attorney Client Privilege Dan Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution As the situation stands now Wildhorses possible responses to the letter are as follows Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment If they do so then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to Crescendo one of which is release of the gas You are right there is no time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives That is a risk I pointed out early However in our letter to Wildhorse I proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of weeks If Wildhorse is not working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we will have to make a choice A Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the contract This will take time Depending on court docket loads months to year B Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in good faith and we consider the gas released contract breached by Wildhorse and that we will build our own system Then Crescendo would build its own system and risk a suit by Wildhorse Not declare Unprofitability If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability then they have the obligation under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms The only complication is that under the contract Wildhorses obligation to take the gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate gas stream Depending on Wildhorses flow dynamics and our plant placement Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas After your field meeting and our engineering assessment hopefully we will have a better understanding of that situation If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability but continues to discuss renegotiating of this deal I would very directly ask them under what provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate any fees They dont have a right to renegotiate under the contract without unprofitability Dan J NRON PM To Gerald CT cc Scott NRON Brian CT Joan CT Subject Summary of Tom Brown Meeting I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today I met with the Business Development Director Bob Mustard Tom Brown as owner of Wildhorse is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up with solutions to the production problems quality pressure et al currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo and other producers low Btu gas they see these as a new business opportunity for Wildhorse Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the Rockies therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development ventures with Crescendo Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very familiar with the nitrogen treating technology I passed all this info on to KenJim Heres the interesting partBob discussed confidentially that for the past monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buyout of Kinder Morgans interest in Wildhorse they have a righttomatch provision in their LLC agreement The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now being negotiated by the very top mgmt Kinder Evans If they are successful which he thinks TBI will be then TBI will turnaround and look to spin off the nonstrategic systems like the Piceance Basin assets to third party purchasers This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with WildhorseWildhorse has been slowplaying negotiations since I first met with them in late May and above may be the reason why Now that weve sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting essentially to clarify their understanding status of the contracts so we can get to work my feeling based on the transaction between KMI TBI is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete how much longer will this take Of course if the transaction is completed TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system so even if ENA is interested will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested The point is thisIm anticipating a generic noncommital response to Crescendos letter from Wildhorse Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out Im off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse Ill keep you informed of any developments Thanks Dan
