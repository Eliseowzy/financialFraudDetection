Makes Push for MAG Plan Lifting Caps on Universal Service Executive Briefings Bush Expected To Act Soon To Fill FCC Chair Transition Team Discusses Agen cy Changes With most of his decisions regarding top cabinetlevel positions out of the way President Bush is expected to begin shifting his attention to selectin g lowerlevel political appointees including the FCC chairman and the administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA Late last week speculation was rife that a decision on the FCC top spot was imminent with a handful of insiders even predicting that a new chairman could be appointed over the inaugural weekend or at the beginning of this week One factor that several GOP insiders say could spur quick action from the White House is the prospect of having Democratic Commissioner Susan Ness assume the chairmanFs duties As the most senior Commissioner at the FC C Ms Ness would slide into that role absent an interim appointment by the president notes one longtime FCC observer FAnd that just doesnFt s it too well with a Republican administrationF the source said Most Washington insiders expect Commissioner Michael K Powell to be named interim chairman as no Senate confirmation is needed for a sitting Commissioner to assume that post FMr Powell is viewed by many as some one who can get the FCC up and running without a learning curveF an industr y source told TR But the question of who gets the permanent FCC job has been the topic du jo ur for most telecom industry watchers Sources say Texas Public Utility Commission Chairman Patrick H Wood III has been positioning himself for th at role but Mr Powell also is considered a frontrunner for the position if he wants it Under one scenario floated by a GOP insider President Bush would name Mr Powell interim chairman and then later on nominate Mr Wood as permanent chairman and a new Democrat to replace Ms Ness Ms NessF term expired in June she currently is serving under a recess appointment that thenPresident Clinton made late last month TR Dec She may continue in her position until a replacement is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate or until the end of the current congressional session L Ari Fleischer a Bush transition team spokesman who was slated to become White House spokesman after the inauguration gave few clues during a Jan press briefing about where the incoming administration stood on naming new agency heads Asked by TR whether a timetable had been developed for appointing a new FCC chairman Mr Fleischer replied FThat will happen in due order as those announcements are readyF A spokesman at the Commerce DepartmentFs NTIA said former Administrator Gregory L Rohde hadnFt made any decisions about his future plans As a political appointee under former President Clinton Mr Rohde stepped down from his post last Friday FThe wireless community wanted him to stay on at NTIA to help oversee th e F GF third generation initiative but so far thereFs been no indicat ionF that President Bush plans to renominate Mr Rohde to be NTIA administrator the NTIA spokesman told TR Mentioned as possible candidates to succeed Mr Rohde at NTIA are Earl Comstock a partner at the Washington law firm of Sher Blackwell and a former aide to Sen Ted Stevens R Alaska James Derderian former House Commerce Committee staff director and a member of the NTIA transition team and Kevin Martin who oversaw communications policy issues for the Bush transition team FCC Transition Team Gathers A Jan meeting of the Bush administrationFs FCC transition team may h ave failed to produce a name and a timetable for replacing Mr Kennard But numerous industry participants described the meeting as a productive first step in smoothing out some of the rough edges at the FCCFparticularly th e pace at which the Commission makes decisions and its role in reviewing mergers Participating in the Jan meeting sources say were nearly all of the F CC Ftransition advisory teamF members TR Jan and officials from t he Bush administrationFs FinhouseF transition team Mr Martin former R ep Bill Paxon R NY who is chairman of the transition advisory committee and Rebecca Armendariz project directorFCC transition team Speaking briefly with TR last week Ms Armendariz described the meeting as F goodF and FproductiveF and said it was the Ffirst and lastF time that the FCC advisory team would meet with Bush transition officials Ms Armendariz al so reported that the FCC advisory team had grown to a total of about member s which is Fsix to eightF more than was posted on the BushCheney trans ition Web site as of Jan An advisory team member who didnFt want to be identified said the meetin g lasted about one and a half hours and mostly focused on changes in general FCC procedures FThere wasnFt much time for a lengthy discussion on specific points and they didnFt mention any namesF of potential chairman nomi nees the source said FBut there was a sense that things need to be speeded up at the FCC and that there ought to be less FCC involvement in the mergerreview contextF the source reported Meanwhile documents circulated among the FCC advisory team members show th e Bush transition team sought feedback from the advisers on the following six subjects the top five issues facing the FCC what rules andor policies are in most need of reform what management administrative or procedural issues need to be addressed what can be done to expedite th e FCCFs decisionmaking process what significant challenges will the new administration and FCC face with respect to Congress public perceptions o r the press and what organizational changes should be considered early i n the new administration Participants in last weekFs meeting were given a chance to go over paper s containing their FCC Fwish listsF sources report and the Bush trans ition team Fseemed to be interested and listeningF Still one source desc ribed the meeting as Flight on

the towe rsiting processF and ensure that wireless carriers Freceive all the interconn ection rights they are due underF the Telecommunications Act of Mr Kitch en said Progress Freedom Foundation fellow Randolph J May also a member of the FCC advisory team called the Jan meeting FproductiveF and said i t gave the Bush transition team a Fgood chance to offer their views on what the y thought were the most important and pressingF issues at the FCC FAt the top of my listF Mr May told TR Fwas changing the strategic focus of th e FCC toward becoming a market deregulatorF SBC Communications Inc recently submitted a paper to the Bush team recommending among other things Fclosing the reciprocal compensation loopholeF and Fensuring that the marketplace regulates broadband Inte rnet serviceF an SBC spokesman told TR SBC also proposed eliminating the Fduplicative review of mergersF tha t carriers face at the FCC and Department of Justice But SBC didnFt spec ify which review should be phased out FThatFs the policy question that needs to be answered by the new administrationF he said Even telecom interests that werenFt represented on the FCC transition advisory team have forwarded their telecom agendas to the Bush administration In a letter sent to Presidentelect Bush on Jan the National Telephone Cooperative Association advised him to appoint FCC commissioners who F understand rural AmericaF and give Fconsiderable thought to rural representationF at NTIA The Association for Local Telecommunications Services has submitted a paper calling the Fthe failureF of incumbent local

International Detariffing Intercarrier Compensation in Biennial Review The FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline a broad range of Commission rules including those governing intercarrier compensation for terminating telecom traffic wireless licensing terms and renewals and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange carriers The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan in Common Carrie r docket The biennial regulatory review provisions of the Communications Act of require the agency in evennumbered years to decide whether given rules remain in the public interest the FCC said The FCC doesnFt have to take final action repealing or modifying the rul es in the evennumbered years it said The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revis ed version of the September staff report on the biennial regulatory revie w TR Sept The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare rulemaking notices on the following F Identifying alternative approaches to intercarrier compensation Fthat are more consistent with the longterm development of competitionF F Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incu mbent local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate subsidiaries F Simplifying FCC review of the Faverage schedulesF used in det ermining certain telcosF costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier Association IncFs revenue pools and F Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the administrative costs of the association which was created by FCC directive to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the following streamlining efforts F Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carrier s Fincluding commercial mobile radio service providers and US carriers classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliationsF F Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing processes F Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licens es to save processing time F Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and assignments of international facilities authorizations under section of the Communications Act of and F Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking notices to pursue the following streamlining goals F Considering whether to eliminate restrictions Fon the aggregate a mount of broadband PCS personal communications service cellular and specialized mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any marketF F Extending license terms beyond years and implementing automatic o r default renewal procedures to avoid latefiling problems F Considering partially privatizing the sitebysite frequencybyfre quency licensing process for the private and common carrier microwave services F Bringing the technical and operational rulesFincluding radiated p ower restrictionsFfor cellular service PCS and general wireless communicati ons service into conformity with each other F Considering whether any of its part cellular rules are obsolete as a result of competitive or technological developments and F Bringing its radio frequency emission regulations into compliance wi th the International Telecommunication UnionFs radio regulations And the Commission asked its Office of Engineering and Technology to prepar e rulemaking notices to address the following issues F Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminatin g ambiguities in equipment test procedures including authorization procedure s for transmitters that operate both in the US and overseas and F Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum ab ove gigahertz The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new rules it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review t o evaluate existing rules It stopped short however of adopting any criter ia in binding rules or procedures The FCC rejected a proposal the US Telecom Association had offered in comments on the September staff report TR Oct USTA had asked the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified a s unnecessary during biennial reviews Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain flexibility the FCC directed all bureaus and offices Fto prioritize rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of comments receivedF in response to the planned rulemaking notices Issuing a separate statement Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth said t he FCC shouldnFt view the biennial reviews as Fa burden to be endured or a hoop through which we must dutifully jump every other yearF He added FA s the Commission moves forward it is my sincere hope that we will devote fulltime yearround staff to this endeavor FurchtgottRoth Says Departure Of Kennard WonFt Bring Deadlock Although the departure of FCC Chairman William E Kennard leaves the agency temporarily with four membersFtwo Republicans and two DemocratsFCommi ssioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth doesnFt expect the agency to be deadlocked FA lot is made about the political divisionsF at the FCC he said Jan during his monthly briefing with reporters FBut I really donFt see it at allF About of the FCCFs votes over the past three years have been unanimo us Mr FurchtgottRoth said Only about or have been F votes he estimated So itFs unlikely that many votes will be deadlocked with the two RepublicansFMr FurchtgottRoth and Michael PowellFvoting against Dem ocratic Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani he said Mr FurchtgottRoth commended thenChairman Kennard for not trying to push F thhourF initiatives before leaving the agency FA lot of people w ere worried that some things might be railroaded throughF he said FCha irman Kennard has been very principled about this not trying to do a lot of thhour rulesF Meanwhile Mr FurchtgottRoth said the FCC had made Fsignificant progr essF in its second Fbiennial reviewF of its regulations The Telecommunic ations Act of directs the FCC to review its regulations every two years and t o eliminate or revise any rules that are no longer necessary or in the public interest Last week the FCC issued a report on what rule changes it would propose as a result of its second biennial review see separate story The report represents a Fsubstantial improvement over the really patheti c effort that was done two years agoF when the agency conducted its first biennial review TR Jan Mr FurchtgottRoth said Mr FurchtgottRoth also reiterated his complaints about the FCCFs coordination with other agencies in reviewing mergers and related license transfers Regarding the proposed Deutsche Telekom AGFVoiceStream Wirel ess Corp merger Mr FurchtgottRoth disagreed with the FCCFs decision to p ut its review on hold while the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe national security concerns TR Dec He said it would be inappropriate for the FCC to impose conditions on the merger that are requested by DoJ and FBI That however has been the FCC Fs practice in past merger reviews he said Time Warner Telecom Inc intends to raise as much as million Time Warner Telecom Inc intends to raise as much as million through the sale of stock and debt securities to help pay for its acquisition of GS T Telecommunications Inc Time Warner Telecom of Littleton Colo reveale d its plan in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission The fund s would be used to repay an unsecured bridge loan that was used to pay for GS T Time Warner Telecom said Further details of the fundraising effort will b e disclosed in future filings it said Time Warner Telecom recently complet ed the million acquisition of GST a competitive local exchange carrier that was in bankruptcy TR Sept UWB Operations Feasible In F GHz Band NTIA Says Ultrawideband UWB devices likely can operate in spectrum between and gigahertz without harming incumbent users including fixed satellite servic e FSS operators according to test results released last week by the Nation al Telecommunications and Information Administration But NTIA said that step s to mitigate interference probably would be necessary NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part of its rules TR Nov Separate tests of UWB devicesF effect on Global Positioning System GPS receivers are expected to be released next month The test results release d last week involved only nonGPS operations Results Will Aid Decision Making NTIA Administrator Gregory L Rohde said at a Jan news conference that the test results Fwill form the basis of negotiations between NTIA and t he FCC to develop a final rule that will permit the development and availabili ty of ultrawideband technologiesF UWB devices use precisely timed pulses of radio frequency RF energy sprea d across a wide swath of spectrum at extremely low power Proponents of the technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications including law enforcement fire and rescue services the military medicine education a nd home and office local area networks TR Sept They say it won Ft interfere with existing systems But aviation groups the GPS and satellite industries and others have expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems TheyFve asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show t hey wonFt cause such interference In its tests NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices on federal airroute surveillance radar airport surveillance radar and air traffic control beacon systems Based on the results of those tests NTIA engineers developed mathematical models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems includin g those operating between and megahertz or and GHz The tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range although limits might need to be placed on power levels distance and pulserepetition frequency However thereFs a question about whether UWB devices would have a Fbig enough windowF to operate if restrictions are imposed Mr Roh de said Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users F GHz micr owave landing services F GHz and Doppler weather radar F GHz For FSS systems Fthe worstcase situationF with regard to interferen ce F would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna elevation angle of degreesF NTIAFs report said There would be m uch less interference potential for FSS systems on tops of buildings or with higher elevation angles it said FHowever at this time uncertainty exists as to the effect of UWB signal duty cycle on the performance of FSS earth stations which have digital signal processingF the report said FThis information would assist in esta blishing the UWB signal peak power limit NTIA study is continuing on this important considerationF Regarding microwave landing services UWB operations at power limits currently permitted for part devices may exceed the receiver interferenc e protection standard More analysis of the effect on such systems is needed NTIA said Tests on systems operating between and MHz and F MHz suggested there could be significant interference problems with incumbent systems NTIA officials said at the news conference But NTIAFs report indicated that UWB operations below GHz were possi ble It said that while UWB operations in that spectrum Fwill be quite challengingF mitigating factors Fcould relax restrictionsF on UWB devices It also said that UWB emission levels would have to be significantly reduce d to guard against interference And it concluded that further studies are needed to assess degradation of existing systems as well as relative level s of noise interference and Fclutter signalsF Mr Rohde said NTIA engineers used existing standards for determining the potential interference of UWB devices FObviously this is going to be a n area thatFll be the subject of a lot of debate as to what really is the criteria that determines interferenceF he added Findings Draw Praise NTIAFs test results drew praise from the UWB industry Officials of Tim e Domain Corp a leading marketer of UWB technology said they were still reviewing NTIAFs findings But they indicated they were happy the tests showed the devices could share nonGPS spectrum FWhile we have questions regarding some of the conclusions made by NTIA we are pleased that the test results confirm that compatible operation of UWB devices with government services is possibleF said Jeffrey L Ross Tim e DomainFs vice presidentcorporate development and strategy FWe have full confidence that the FCC will impose appropriate regulations and power limit s and look forward to the FCCFs timely completion of its rulemakingF h e added Last year Time Domain questioned NTIAFs testing methods saying they mu st reflect realworld conditions to be accurate TR Sept Another developer of UWB devices Fantasma Networks Inc also hailed the test results FWe are confident that our deployment of ultrawideband devices does not pose a threat of harmful interference to public safety agencies or to any other user of the radio spectrumF said Roberto Aiell o FantasmaFs chief technology officer Angelos Amends Lawsuit Against Wireless Industry As expected noted plaintiffsF attorney Peter G Angelos has entered the legal fray against the wireless industry over the safety of mobile phones Mr Angelos has filed an amended lawsuit on behalf of a Maryland doctor who claims that using a mobile phone caused his brain tumor TR Aug and Dec The lawsuit filed last week in the US District Court in Maryland seeks million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages The lawsuit says the industry failed to conduct adequate testing on the health effects of mobile phones and warn consumers about known risks The industry Fmanipulated the results of other testing concealed evidence t hat mobile phone radiation is harmful and suppressed scientific and medical researchF the lawsuit alleges According to the lawsuit the medical and scientific communities have been aware of the biological effects of radio frequency RF exposure since the s The wireless industry was or should have been aware of evidence of such health hazards the lawsuit alleges Michael F Altschul vice president and general counsel of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association which is named in the lawsuit said he hadnFt seen the amended complaint FRegardless of who the lawyer is the legal requirements remain the s ameF Mr Altschul said The plaintiffs have to show a link between RF radiation exposure and cancer he said and Fthat science just isnFt thereF Spokesmen for Motorola Inc and Verizon Communications Inc which also are named as defendants have made similar points Last weekFs amended lawsuit Christopher J Newman et al v Motorola I nc et al case no CCB was filed after US District Judge Catherine C Blake last month dismissed a number of the counts in the original filing but gave the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint The wireless industry had succeeded in moving the case from Baltimore City Circuit Court to federal court Mr Angelos owner of the Baltimore Orioles has won major cases against th e asbestos industry and represented Maryland in litigation against the tobacc o industry John A Pica a lawyer in Mr AngelosF Baltimore firm has be en quoted saying Mr Angelos plans to file lawsuits this year against the wireless industry Messrs Angelos and Pica could not be reached for comme nt Bob Gordon a consultant to Baltimore attorney Joanne Lynch Suder who file d the original lawsuit on behalf of the Maryland doctor said Mr Angelos agreed to be the cocounsel in a number of cases that Ms Suder planned to file against the phone industry Lawyers around the country also are worki ng on the planned litigation he said Meanwhile last week German researchers said there could be a link between the use of mobile phones and cancer of the inner eye The results were published in the January issue of the research journal Epidemiology But the researchers who interviewed subjects with eye cancer and a control group of people said their findings were inconclusive because of the studyFs limitations In a statement CTIA cited those limitations a nd the small size of the study group NTIA Proposes Reimbursement Procedures For Relocated Government Spectrum Us ers The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is proposing procedures for relocating federal government spectrum incumbents to other bands to make way for commercial users Among the issues to be decided are the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement NTIA Administrator Gregory L Rohde said the rules could bolster a highlev el effort to identify and allocate spectrum for thirdgeneration G wireless services ThenPresident Clinton launched the initiative by executive memorandum in October TR Oct Nov and Nov and Jan As part of that effort NTIA is studying the possible use of the F megahertz band which is used heavily by the Defense Department The FCC i s analyzing use of the F MHz band which is used mostly by multich annel multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service operators NTIAFs proposed rules would cover such future reallocations Mr Rohde s aid at an industrygovernment meeting on the G plan last week He said he hop ed the final rules would be released this summer The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year required privat e entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or modifying their systems because of reallocation The notice of proposed rulemaking NTIA released Jan suggests ways to implement that mandate Comments are due March with replies due April in docket no In its rulemaking notice NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technicall y possible in their present bands If the incumbents are not required to relocate under what conditions shoul d they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for an y system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing NTIA asks For example it asks should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the ba nd on a noninterference basis with G systems NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a F comparable facilityF is available for a reasonable period of time It defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operationa l capabilities as the original spectrum NTIA suggests using four factors to determine comparability communications throughput system reliability operating costs and operational capability It seeks comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs including a mandatory negotiation period thirdparty mediation and nonbinding arbitration NTIA seeks comments on what type of costsharing plan to adopt and asks whether a Fband managerF or some other entity should serve as a clear inghouse to administer the plan And it wants input on whether it should Fsunset F a costsharing plan five years after any auction of former government spectrum The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectru m with classified frequency assignments At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of and the Balanced Budget Act of NTIA identified MHz of spectrum that can b e reallocated from federal government to private use The bands identified f or which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are F MHz F MHz F MHz and F MHz The FCC has proposed allocating the F MHz band for G services In addition Mr Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the F MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the G initiative Rohde Uncertain of EffortFs Future At last weekFs G meeting Mr Rohde said he didnFt know if the Bush administration would make any changes to the G effort which is operating on a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for G spectrum b y Sept But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings with Bush transition team staff members FI canFt predict whatFs going to happenF beyond Inauguration Day Mr Rohde told reporters The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA James Derderian a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee couldn Ft be reached for comment But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce secretary earlier this month Donald L Evans said the Bush administration was committed to finding G spectrum TR Jan Industry Expresses Frustration At last weekFs meeting several industry representatives expressed frustration that they didnFt have access to data they said they needed t o make recommendations on use of the F MHz and F MHz ba nds in time for NTIA and the FCC to consider Industry representatives in NTIAestablished working groups are reviewing the bands The G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released i n March with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in Ju ly Rick Kemper directorwireless technology and security for the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association said determining the cost of relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how they are being used But he said that data wasnFt available Donald Brittingham directorwireless policy for Verizon Wireless said he was concerned that the final band studies wouldnFt reflect all the indus tryFs input He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports FOne concern is weFre going to do a lot of work and in the end it wil l be too late to be included in your final reportF added Joanne C Wilson directorglobal public affairs for Lucent Technologies Inc Frederick R Wentland NTIAFs directorspectrum plans and policies said some information wouldnFt be available until the final band studies were released FUnfortunately time happens to be our enemy hereF Mr We ntland added But he urged industry officials to continue participating in the process including filing comments in response to the FCCFs recent notice of prop osed rulemaking on G spectrum TR Jan Diane J Cornell associate chief of the FCCFs Wireless Telecommunicatio ns Bureau said the current process was designed Fto crystalize the issues F and she urged industry engineers to focus on technical issues concerning band sharing and segmentation Ms Cornell also said industry should submit comments in response to NTIA Fs notice and an FCC rulemaking notice released in November suggesting allocations for MHz of spectrum transferred from government to private u se TR Nov After the final band studies are released in March she said FI expect there will be differences of perspectivesF She said industry officials would get another chance to submit comments after that AntennaRule Violations Prompt Proposed Forfeitures of K The FCC and its Enforcement Bureau have proposed that two wireless carriers and two tower companies pay for violations of its antenna rules The largest proposed forfeiture was against American Tower Corp for violations in states and Washington DC The FCC has ordered the Enforcement Bureau to conduct a more thorough investigation of American Tow erF s compliance with its rules Separately the Enforcement Bureau proposed an forfeiture against Telecorp Communications Inc an forfeiture against ATT Wireless Services Inc and an forfeiture against SpectraSite Corp In a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture the FCC said American Tow er failed to properly light an antenna during construction register t wo existing antennas notify the agency of ownership changes involving antennas and post registration numbers on nine antennas FWe are concerned that ATC continues to violate our rules despite both o ral and written warnings regarding the CommissionFs antenna structure requirementsF the FCC said in its Jan forfeiture notice It said m ore than half of American TowerFs violations were uncovered after a July meeting between FCC field agents and American Tower officials In separate notices released the same day the Enforcement Bureau found tha t Telecorp failed to light antennas properly on four occasions and that ATT Wireless failed to post antenna registration numbers on nine occasions It also found that SpectraSite failed to post antenna registration numbers on four occasions and failed to notify the FCC of ownership changes on three occasions The violations were discovered by FCC field agents during routi ne investigations and inspections Russell Wilkerson directorcorporate affairs for TeleCorp PCS Inc told TR FWeFre talking to our folks in the field to compare the cases b y the FCC and some of their findings and then we

State Immunity Issue The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit New Orleans echoing thre e other appellate circuits has ruled that the US Constitution doesnFt protect state utility commissions from federal judicial review of their decisions regarding carrier interconnection agreements In a twotoone decision issued Jan the Fifth Circuit rejected th Amendment immunity claims raised by the Louisiana Public Service Commission during proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed by ATT Corp ATT was challenging the PSCFs arbitration decision regarding its interconne ction agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications Inc Section of the Telecommunications Act of directed state commission s to review approve and when necessary arbitrate carrier interconnection agreements The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropria te federal district court to the review the carrier agreement In ATT Communications v BellSouth Telecommunications Inc et al case no the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the US District Cou rt in Baton Rouge The lower court had held that the th Amendment to the U S Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees ATT had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit The th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the US Supreme Court in its decision in Ex parte Young The Ex parte Young doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoin g violations of federal law The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the interconnection dispute under the provisions of the Act The court al so ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to ATTFs request for prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that ATT had argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections and of the Act The appeals court reversed the district courtFs ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings Circuit Judge James L Dennis wrote the opinion a nd was joined by Judge Henry A Politz Judge Jerry E Smith dissented from t he majorityFs opinion Finding Echoes Other Circuits Appeals courts in the Sixth Seventh and th Circuits already have held that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements TR April and Oct and Jan June and July Last fall the US Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising in the Sixth Circuit TR Oct In his dissent Judge Smith cited the US Supreme CourtFs decision in Seminole Tribe v Florida Under that ruling he said CongressF referr al of disputes surrounding state commissionFarbitrated interconnection agreeme nts F supplantsF a partyFs ability to sue the state commission under the Supreme Court decision in Ex parte Young But he added CongressF refe rral of such disputes to the federal courts violates the th Amendment to the Constitution The Chicagobased Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument last year in which state utility commissioners had invoked Seminole Tribe TR July AeA Seeking Federal Preemption Of Multiple

about the technical resources or Fbuilding blocksF a distribution system would require to support ITV The FCC said it saw thre e major building blocks a video stream a twoway highspeed Intern et protocol connection and specialized customer premises equipment FTo assess the possibilities for discriminatory behavior and what enforc ement procedures might be effective for any rules that might be proposed in the future it is important to understand clearly how ITV providers will delive r their services to consumers including what type of contractual arrangement s will governF the FCC said It also asked whether cable TV providers would have the Fsuperior platfo rmF for distribution of highspeed ITV service and sought comment on the ITV capabilities of direct broadcast satellite providers and digital subscriber line service providers The FCC also sought comment on the legal classifications of ITV services what public and statutory objectives ITV rules would promote and what authority the FCC has over such services The notice states that the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of directed the FCC to adopt rules Flimiting the sh are of cable capacity that could be used for commonly owned content and requiri ng vertically integrated cable programmers to provide their content to rival distribution platforms on nondiscriminatory termsF The FCC added that if the Fsame factual predicates that Congress cited in the Cable Act w ere to apply to a distribution platform delivering ITV services then some regulation of those distribution facilities might be warrantedF The notice also asks for comment on how the FCC could implement rules to ba r providers of multichannel video programming from discriminating against unaffiliated ITV providers It asked for

about the FCCFs legal authority to address ITV issues Robert Sachs president and chief executive officer of the National Cable Television Association was FpleasedF that the FCC was launching an i

broadcasters with licenses for channels F now occupy large chunks of the spectrum and donFt have to leave until at the earlies t as part of the transition to digital TV Mr Scott said the uncertainty over when incumbent broadcasters would leave the spectrum was still an issue He also noted that the FCC hadnFt yet adopted proposed bandclearing mechanisms for those frequencies Even if such mechanisms were adopted immediately MHz band auction bidders woul dnF t have time to use them he said Mr Scott also mentioned the highlevel governmentindustry effort to identify and allocate spectrum

bands That order is expected this summer FThere remains considerable uncertainty about the process for the auctio n the availability of the MHz band itself and the availability of alternate spectrumF Mr Scott said in the letter FAs a matter of s ound spectrummanagement policy this spectrum should not be auctioned until the se issues are resolvedF FConducting the auction before prospective bidders

though rural telcos serve only a small percentage of the telecom market their operations cover nearly o f the nationFs land and in many cases theyFre entering multiple lines of business ThatFs the message the National Telephone Cooperative Associa tion is carrying to the FCC and Congress as it seeks to garner more federal support for some of its pet projects On Capitol Hill NTCA plans to revive its legislative push to eliminate cap s on the amount that individual carriers are eligible to receive in universal service support says Chief Executive Officer Michael Brunner The association is considering broadening that proposal to include a broadband tax credit plan he says At the FCC the groupFs most pressing concern is getting quick adoption of the multiassociation group MAG plan for overhauling the interstate access charge system for telcos operating under rateofreturn regulation Mr Brunner tells TR An edited transcript of our conversation follows TR What are NTCAFs top priorities for the th Congress Should we e xpect to see your proposal from the last Congress to lift the universal service c ap Brunner The answer is yes As you know we were instrumental in working with Sen Conrad Burns R Mont in getting that bill introduced in the last session Obviously thatFs a priority again as the Rural Task Forc e has sort of come up with half a loaf in recommending an index cap We see the Rural Task Force plan as better obviously than the current situation but we see it causing a problem down the road For example if a lot of acquisitions occurFand I think they willFthen thereFs going to be a need to upgrade all those lines The current cap wonFt be adequate to do that and we hope the Commission under any circumstances wouldnFt go below what the Rural Task Force is recommending TR That effort garnered bipartisan backing from key US senators last session WhatFs your strategy for expanding congressional support for i t in the th Congress Brunner One way to do that might be to go back to the drafting of the Telecommunications Act of when Congress really understood that we hav e to give equal weight to the twin goals of competition and universal service Our feeling is that this Commission and the past Commissions perhaps may have given more weight to competition and less to universal service ItFs real clear in the statute that Congress thinks those issues are equ ally weighted and whether or not people like it things cost more in rural America If we really want to bring broadband services to all Americans w e canFt do it without some kind of support And if Congress is saying on the one hand FDeploy advanced servicesF it seems odd to say on the other hand FWeFre going to limit this cap l imit the supportF Rep Nathan Deal R Ga was our key guy in the House on this last year and Sen Burns in the Senate WeFre working with a lot of other people too to see if we canFt be more comprehensive this time around For example another key component of our plan could be some kind of tax credit or a lowinterest Rural Utilities Service loan And rather than have one bill address this part and one for that part we may have all of those wind up in one comprehensive package On the broadband tax credit plan the idea is to develop a bill that would enable carriers to claim a fairly substantial credit for deploying broadband services to rural areas We donFt want it to be technology specific where you end up with something that seems to favor one technolog y over the other I donFt want to be too specific because weFre still working with a nu mber of our own members to work out the details We donFt have a perfect packag e yet and I donFt think it would be hugely expensive We realize no o neFs going to go for a big spending bill especially with the economy sort of turning right now or potentially turning But weFre still moving forward on this Our annual meeting will be held the first week in February and thatFs when weFre really going to start h ashing out some of these things and talking about some overall policy resolutions TR One thing you havenFt mentioned is a deregulatory approach to broad band service deployment Why Brunner We really havenFt been drawn to that approach for a lot of rea sons one being that we think a broadband tax credit bill is a more targeted approach that really gets at the issue If the policymakers really want t o deploy broadband services nationwide and they say they do this is the way to help us to do it TR Staying on the congressional front whatFs NTCAFs reaction to Fr ed Upton R Mich who has limited telecom experience being named chairman of th e House Energy and Commerce CommitteeFs telecommunications subcommittee Brunner WeFre excited about Fred Upton being in that role He does ha ve some rural parts to his district in fact some of our own commercial telco members are up thereFBloomingdale Telephone Co of Bloomingdale Mich and Climax Telephone Co of Climax Mich Also the ratio now in the House is about urban members to one rural member So whenever you get a person with some rural territory in a key telecom policymaking slot NTCA is thrilled We think that Mr Upton will do a good job and hope heFll be sensitive to NTCAFs issues TR I understand that youFve been consulting with members of Congress a bout the MAG plan and that some senators have asked the FCC to put it on the fro nt burner What kind of time line do you have in mind for action on the MAG plan Brunner We want to move it quickly WeFve spent a lot of time as hav e other trade associations getting our members on board It was a grueling process and I think the productFs pretty good So our feeling at this point is that we really want the whole thing adopted as is WeFre not comfortable backing off any part of it If the Commission doe s back off or review it then we reserve the right to say FStop and let Fs look at it againF The main thing is keeping the process moving ItFs easy for things to g et bogged down in the regulatory or congressional processes We have many friends on Capitol Hill mainly in the Senate where so many members have k ey rural areas in their state The main message right now is FLetFs ke ep the MAG plan movingF Most people think itFll probably take six months to a year to get the wh ole thing through The other wild card to some extent is the Rural Task Forc e report which is moving along on a fast track ThereFs some commonality between those two Our dreamFalthough we thought it probably wasnFt super likelyFwas that the Commission would just simply adopt the MAG plan as i s TR What about the expected turnover at the FCC How do you see that affecting the CommissionFs consideration of the MAG plan Brunner It could go a bunch of different ways You could get someone coming in who says FA lot of real smart people spent a lot of time on t his and rather than reinvent the wheel IFm more inclined to support itF Or you could get someone else who says FI donFt understand all this and I want to start from square one and take my timeF We just donFt know who the players are going to be I expect some of the current Commissioners still will be there TR Most believe Commissioner Michael K Powell will be tapped to fill the vacant chairman seat at least initially Have you gotten any feedback fro m his office about his position on the MAG plan Brunner Not really WeFve visited the staffs of all the Commissioners and most of them werenFt real specific on the plan So we certainly want to give him and others the benefit of the doubt We hope they would view it favorably I think everyone will respect the work that went into it even if they donFt agree with it TR LetFs talk about your recent white paper recommending that universa l service FhighcostF support be FnonportableF TR Jan Ho w did you come to this conclusion and where do you go with it Brunner What weFve got there is a study with some actual data It sho ws that introducing competition in rural areas is ultimately going to lead to less broadband technology deployment Our next step is to try to convince regulators that artificial competition doesnFt work If thereFs an actual market for more than one carrier then indeed consumers might benefit But there arenFt great public benefits as we see it to artificially creating competition where markets donFt ordinarily permit competition as a matter of course Our point is that sometimes the regulators try to take an urban solution an d inject it into rural America It makes sense to induce competition in downtown areas like Los Angeles or Chicago where the average Bell company has anywhere from to customers per mile But we only have four or five or six per mileFvery small numbers We would argue that itFs hard for one carrier to really make it in these markets And if they force a second one or a third one in it splits up th e business even more and no oneFs going to have the wherewithal to delive r broadband services One of our main themes on Capitol Hill and at the Commission is that policymakers need to appreciate the fact that rural areas are different Most policymakers as you might imagine have an urban background Our job is to continue to try to educate people about the differences between urban and rural areas WeFve done that with some success For example weFve had several of the Commissioners come out and speak at our meetings spend time with our members talk with them oneonone Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth for example came out and visited a small telco with us We really look for opportunities to give them a greater appreciation of these kinds of things Going back to Congress we also want to really caution people not to reopen up the Telecommunications Act or to pass a new Act until some of the key rural issues are resolved WeFre now going on five years since passage of the Telecommunications Act and some of our members still canFt plan bec ause they donFt know about the outcome of access charge reform As you kno w our members get better than of their revenues from access charges The biggest decisions for the new Commission will be on highcost support a nd access charge reform Both the MAG and the Rural Task Force plans have touched on that TR Switching gears to the incoming Bush administration how do you forese e the Department of AgricultureFs Rural Utilities Service RUS developing over the next few years Will there be major changes Brunner Actually to be honest no one knows My sense is that the RUS n o longer is the political issue it used to be because when people look at it theyFre seeing that the cost of that program is so minute ItFs some where around million or million in interest subsidies for about millio n in loans And everyone thinks it does work well thereFs never been a default So I donFt sense weFre going to have an effort as was made in the Reagan administration to really cut back on some of these things I could be totally wrong but my sense is it has enough respect and support on both sides of the aisle Plus the lending no longer is simply for the same Fplain old telephone serviceF itFs now for some new things TR LetFs talk about NTCAFs membership What kind of efforts are un der way to accommodate some of your membersF nonILEC incumbent local exchange carrier operations Brunner Many years ago there were questions about how our members would adapt to change in competition My sense is that theyFre adapting quite well as almost all of them are in multiple lines of business TheyFre becoming Internet service providers many of them are in the cable TV business most of them have wireless or broadcast satellite operations som e are resellers and many are becoming CLECs competitive local exchange carriers TheyFve gotten into multiple lines of business so they are becoming in a lot of ways more than ILECs WeFve broadened our approach to assist th em in some other areas So itFs a very active membership some more than othe rs We have a new initiative called CA ItFs really an effort to get membe rs who are thinking more competitively to get together and perhaps aggregate their businesses with things like volume discounts IFve been very pleased with our membershipFs willingness to grow and change For a while I thought they just might want to keep doing things the same ol d way that has always worked for them But they really are changing WeFre not the biggest player WeFre only about of the industry b ut it really is a critical We represent roughly of the land in this country but itFs a unique and critical part We would just really hope that the policymakers would make it a priority t o understand that the we serve is as important as the whole ThatFs something that some people miss Executive Briefings The New FCC F

Business Executive Briefings FCC Expands ILEC LineSharing Mandates To Fiber Loops Confirms LineSplitting Duty The FCC has given data CLECs competitive local exchange carriers a major win by expanding incumbent local exchange carriersF FlinesharingF and F linesplittingF duties The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in Common Carrier dockets and The order addressed petitions for reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing TR Nov Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs allow competitors to offer highspeed service over the highfrequen cy portion of a loop while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the lowfrequency portion In the order adopted Jan the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing over the entire loop even if theyFve deployed fiber in the loop to suppl ement or replace the original copper line The order was one of many actions tha t the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E KennardFs tenure but that were not immediately available eventually trickling out of the Commission last week Rhythms NetConnections Inc had filed a petition for clarification with t he FCC complaining that some ILECs were contending they didnFt have to unb undle fiber portions of the loop when those portions were used to provide xDSL digital subscriber line services FIn the absence of this clarification a competitive LEC might undertake to collocate a DSLAM digital subscriber line access multiplexer in an incumbentFs central office to provide lineshared xDSL services to custo mers only to be told by the incumbent that it was migrating those customers to fiberfed facilitiesF the FCC said In that case the CLEC would have to collocate another DSLAM in a remote terminal to continue offering lineshar ed services to the same customers FAll indications are that fiber deployment by incumbent LECs is increasi ng and that collocation by competitive LECs at remote terminals is likely to b e costly timeconsuming and often unavailableF the FCC said The FCC says ILECs must allow for Fline splittingF so competitors th at offer voice service using the unbundled network element platform can provideFo r partner with another data CLEC to provideFDSL service on those same line s FIncumbent LECs are required to make all necessary network modifications to facilitate line splitting including providing nondiscriminatory access to operation support systems necessary for preordering ordering provisioning maintenance and repair and billing for loops used in linesplitting arrangementsF the FCC said The FCC Fstrongly urgedF ILECs and CLECs to Fwork together to deve lop processes and systems to support competing carriersF ordering and provisioning of unbundled loops and switching necessary for line splitting F The FCC however denied a related petition for clarification filed by ATT Corp It had asked the FCC to require ILECs to make their xDSL services available to customers even if they obtain voice service from competing carriers using the ILECsF lines ATT was worried that customers wouldn Ft switch their voice service to a competitor if that change would eliminate their ability to get DSL services FAlthough the linesharing order obligates incumbent LECs to make the highfrequency portion of the loop separately available to competing carrie rs on loops where incumbent LECs provide voice service it does not require th at they provide xDSL service when they are no longer the voice providerF t he FCC said FTo the extent that ATT believes that specific incumbent behavior const rains competition in a manner inconsistent with the CommissionFs linesharing rules andor the Communications Act of as amended itself we encourage AT T to pursue enforcement actionF it said The FCC also denied requests from Bell Atlantic Corp now Verizon Communications Inc It had asked the FCC to reconsider the requirement that ILECs refusing to condition a loop for the provision of DS L service demonstrate to the relevant state commission that conditioning that loop would degrade voice services and permit a linesharing deployment schedule other than the one it adopted Rhythms applauded the FCCFs decision FBy expanding the definition o f line sharing to include fiber loops and ensuring our ability to use consumersF existing voice lines for data services we can bring the benefits of the mo st robust broadband service offerings to consumersF said Jeffrey Blumenfel d chief legal officer and general counsel for Rhythms During a press briefing last week see separate story Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs at Verizon Communications Inc criticized the FCCFs decision specifically the provisions requiring line splitting The FCC FdidnFt address how thi s is to be doneF he said Jonathan Lee vice presidentregulatory affairs at the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the order was an Funmitigated win F for data CLECs But he said the FCCFs decision not to grant ATTFs petit ion for clarification was FregrettableF Residential consumers who have DSL available only from the ILEC wonFt be able to switch their voice service without losing their DSL service he said M r Lee compared the ILECsF FtyingF of voice and DSL service to Micros oft CorpFs practice of linking its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system The ILEC practice Fcould run afoul of antitrust laws F he said Critics Worry White House FErateF Proposal May Reduce Funding Disco urage Participation The education reform package that President Bush sent to Congress last week is drawing criticism from policymakers who helped draft and implement the F ErateF telecom discount program ItFs also sparking concern among s chools and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it TheyFre worried that the presidentFs Erate proposal if adopted in i ts current FblueprintF form would discourage certain schools from apply ing for discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections In th e long run they fear that the presidentFs proposal would lead to decrease d funding for the program which currently stands at billion a year The main problem these critics say is that shifting administration of the program to the Department of Education as President Bush has said he inten ds to do would render Erate funding dependent on congressional appropriations In its current form under the FCCFs oversight the prog ram is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers The technology part of the presidentFs education reform initiative unvei led last week calls for combining the Erate with several Department of Educati on programs to form one Fperformancebased technology grant programF T hen it says funding for that program would be disbursed Fby formulaF to sta tes through block grants The aim is to streamline the many Fduplicative technology programsF i nto one education grant plan the Bush administration says Such streamlining woul d go a long way toward reducing the Erate programFs Fburdensome paperw orkF requirements and adding more flexibility to those program the proposal say s FFlexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes that include software purchases and development wiring and technology infrastructure and teacher training in the use of technologyF it state s It also would permit Erate recipients to use federal funds to pay for Internet filtering software which is being mandated for the first time thi s year by the ChildrenFs Internet Protection Support Act of TR Jan But key US lawmakers and education officials arenFt prepared to embrac e the plan yet They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on several issues including how the Erate program would be funded and what formula would be used to distribute money among the states Jeff Burnett directorgovernment relations at the National Association of Independent Schools says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service Fund as it is now or by general tax revenues FThatFs a huge quest ion mark and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it wou ld become part of the Department of EducationFs budgetF he says Mr Burnett says making the Erate dependent on general tax revenues could F destabilizeF its funding and discourage some private and parochial schoo ls from applying for telecom discounts FIt would go from where it is now a pretty stable billion per year to where you would have arguments eve ry year in Congress over how much money it would getF Plus he says Erate funds Fno longer would be stringfreeF if they were to be allocated by the federal government Moving the program to the Departme nt of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because of potential Fchurchstate problemsF he says referring to the First Am endment to the US Constitution which prohibits congressional establishment of an official religion And some states may be restricted by their state constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to priva te and religious schools he adds Former FCC Chairman Reed E Hundt who oversaw the implementation of the Erate program back in fears that the end result could be the Fkil ling of the program altogetherF or a Fchopping of it down from a significa nt program to an insignificant oneF Having the Education Department oversee the Erate program would remove stability from the program Mr Hundt stressed FWhere are they going t o find or billion dollars in the general tax revenues to pay for it F he asked FThe bigger telecom service providers probably would be hap py but the support would be reducedF Mr Hundt told TR last week He also rejected the administrationFs claims that consolidating the educ ation technology programs would reduce applicantsF paperwork and filing requirements FMoving it to the Department of Education is not a way to simplify paperworkF Mr Hundt said FNothing is simpler than the wa y itFs done now These forms donFt even go to the government they go to a privately run trust fundF he added A source who works with schools on finetuning their Erate applications foresees a Ffood fight at the state levelF if the Bush administration institutes a blockgrant program FThere wonFt be the same spirit of cooperation among the schools and libraries that there is todayF the so urce says FInstead theyFll see each other as competitionF A library official said that even if the Erate program remained part of th e USF expanding its scope to include software purchases and teacher training could give telecom carriers grounds for a legal challenge of the assessment s made on their revenues FIf the money is to come from the service provi der then the program must directly relate back to the services that they provide I could see someone challenging the software and teachertraining aspectsF the source says Snowe Rockefeller Are Skeptical The program has received an icy response from two US senators who were among the original sponsors of the legislation that added the Erate provisions to the Telecommunications Act of Republican Olympia J Snowe Maine and Democrat John D Rockefeller IV WVa In a statement issued soon after the Bush education proposal was released Jan Sen Rockefeller vowed to Faggressively fightF the Erate as pects of the proposal It would be a Fgrave mistakeF to fold the Erate into a block grant program with the Education Department technology programs Sen Rockefeller said FUnder the Bush blockgrant approach local schools would have less flexibility not moreF Sen Rockefeller said FPrivate and parochia l schools would have to negotiate with state education agencies and worry abo ut entanglements of federal regulations Most importantly the secure funding for the Erate and investments in technology would be jeopardizedF he s aid Sen Snowe also worries about turning the Erate into a blockgrant program Among other things she says such a proposal could deter private and parochial schools from participating in the program FWe plan to work with President Bush and our colleagues in the Congress to ensure that the current program is protected as we donFt support any ef forts that would undermine its goalsF a Snowe aide told TR New House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Fred Upton R Mich h as told President Bush in a letter that he plans to hold several hearings this year on Faspects of your proposal that fall under the subcommitteeFs jurisdictionF including the Erate plan Rep Upton has asked the Bush administration to focus on broadband service deployment Fparticularly as it relates to how increased access to high speed data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve educational opportunitiesF Numerous calls to the White House seeking comment weren Ft returned before TRFs Friday afternoon news deadline FCC Gears Up To Enforce Erate FNetFilter Mandate The FCC wants advice on how to implement the ChildrenFs Internet Protect ion Act of CIPA which requires schools and libraries that receive F ErateF discounts for Internet services and internal connections to use F filteringF technology that prevents minors from accessing FharmfulF material over the FNet The FCC has suggested that recipients

technologyF must filter out F visual depictionsF of FobsceneF material or Fchild pornographyF ev en when adults are using the computers Schools and libraries are required to bar access to visual depictions that are Fharmful to minorsF only when minors are u sing the computers The law requires Erate recipients to certify each program year that they a re complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of the filtering technology while the computers are in use The law allows an administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is bei ng used by an adult Ffor bona fide research or other lawful purposeF Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy in the first year after the effective date of the law they either must certif y that they have such a policy or that they are developing one The law also allows schools and libraries to seek a waiver from the FCC during the lawFs second year if state or local procurement rules or competitive bidding requirements have prevented them from implementing an Internet safety policy The FCCFs further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Co mmon Carrier docket

applicants see separate story Large Carriers Want MHz Auction Postponed But Small Providers Broadcasters Oppose Delay Large wireless carriers are once again asking the FCC to postpone the scheduled auction of licenses for the megahertz band citing a host of familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the frequencies But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin t he auction March as scheduled noting that the sale already has been postponed three times They say that large carriers have had plenty of tim e to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in respon se to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September TR Jan Several large carriers that supported the request asked for an even longer postponement Supporters of postponement cited the presence of broadcasters in the spectr um and the need to negotiate bandclearing agreements as evidence to support their cause see separate story Most of their arguments echoed those of Verizon Wireless TV broadcasters donFt have to evacuate the spectrum channels F as part of the transition to digital TV until at the earliest But wireless carriers citing the uncertainty about when the frequencies slated to be auctioned will be available for use have asked the FCC and Congress to for ce the broadcasters out early In addition to the presence of the broadcasters other reasons the large carriers said the auction should be delayed included concerns that a reauction of FCF and FFF block PCS personal communications ser vice licenses hadnFt finished in time for carriers to assess their spectrum needs in t he MHz auction see separate story companies need more time

will not benefit potential bidders for the spectrumF agr eed Shop At Home NetworkFMoreover VerizonFs arguments that a further de lay will benefit it and other potential auction participants are specious at best F FCC Takes Additional Steps To Help Clear MHz Band The FCC has taken additional steps to help spur the relocation of incumbent TV broadcasters from the megahertz band in order to make way for wirele ss carriers But it said it wouldnFt force the incumbents to clear the frequenciesFat least not yet In a third report and order released last week the Commission said it had decided to allow the private sector to determine what bandclearing mechanisms best suited the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers Specifically the FCC has decided not to impose costsharing rules cost caps or costrecovery guidelines at this time on the relocation of incumbe nt broadcasters Last year the agency asked whether it should impose such rul es TR June and July FSecondary AuctionsF Touted The FCC also will leave it up to industry to decide if Fsecondary auctio nsF should be organized to facilitate bandclearing agreements before the auction which is scheduled to begin March The FCC earlier asked for comments on whether it had the authority to conduct such auctions In the order released last week the FCC reiterated its view of the benefit s of such auctions saying they Fhave potential to offer both broadcasters and new entrants additional opportunities to reduce the potential transaction costs of negotiating with each other directly after the auctionF As part of their transition to digital TV DTV broadcasters donFt have to leave the MHz band channels F until at the earliest The y may stay longer if less than of households in their markets have access to DTV signals That timetable has created uncertainty among wireless carrier s about how much to bidFor whether to bid at allFon the spectrum when i t is auctioned Wireless carriers have asked the FCC to force TV broadcasters out of the spectrum before they are required to leave TR Aug For their part broadcasters have fought such bandclearing mandates and instead have urged the FCC to address larger issues related to the DTV transition especially digital FmustcarryF cable TV rights The FCC recently took several actions that it said would facilitate broadcastersF transition to DTV including those dealing with mustcarry rights In its MHz band order the FCC said it wanted to give voluntary mechanisms a chance in clearing the frequencies for wireless services F We believe that voluntary agreements between broadcasters and licensees should result in the effective clearing of the MHz bandF it said FHow ever we will revisit this issue in the future if we find it necessaryF The FCCFs latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory treatment of private bandclearing agreements For example the agency extended to threeway agreements a general F rebuttable presumptionF adopted last year for bilateral pacts The presumption is that such agreements are in the public interest The FCC also provided guidance on interference issues arising from relocati on agreements that involve moving a broadcaster to a channel below channel And it has streamlined the review of bandclearing agreements and affirmed that it expeditiously will process bandclearing agreements It also clarified that voluntary agreements to temporarily relocate licensees into channels F would be permitted Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the report and order In a statement she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable presumption to threeway agreements She expressed concern that such agreements would result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she wanted to consider bandclearing agreements case by case FAs I have stated previously my ultimate concern is that the presumptio n in favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value o f free overtheair television servicesF Commissioner Tristani said She also took exception with the FCCFs statement that it might revisit i ssues surrounding the mandatory relocation of broadcasters FI remain convinc ed that such action would contravene the statuteF establishing broadcasters F DTV transition she said The FCCFs order was adopted Jan in Wireless Telecommunications docke t Cable Services docket and Mass Media docket A news release on the action and the text of the document were released Jan Kennard Requests Hard Stand In a related development former FCC Chairman William E Kennard has asked Congress to take a hard stand against broadcasters in their transition to DTV Writing Jan to Sen Ernest F Hollings D SC Mr Kennard suggested that Congress set a firm deadline of Dec for TV broadcasters in channels F to relocate He also proposed that broadcasters using channels F after that date b e charged an escalating fee to encourage them to clear the spectrum Writing Jan to Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John McCain R Ariz Lyle Gallagher president of the Association of PublicSafety Communications OfficialsInternational expressed support for Mr KennardFs proposals to help clear the MHz band At the very least steps should be taken to clear channels F Mr Gallagher said Public safety agencies urgently need access to MHz of spectrum in the MHz band that the FCC has reallocated for their use he said but much of it is occupied by broadcasters FBy making the Dec date firm for channels F state and local governments throughout the nation could plan on spectrum being available no later than Jan and could proceed with necessary funding frequenc y planning design and

Telecommunications Internet Association President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas E Wheeler A scarcity in frequencies is hurting US carriersF competitiveness with their foreign counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet he said Mr Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier ma y hold in any one market while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate frequencies for thirdgeneration G services proceeded Such a move woul d ease the spectrum crunch he reasoned At a briefing for reporters last week he said the Bush administration had its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable band s for G use US Seen Falling Behind FGod bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy r eview process but it couldnFt bring it to fruition and it now falls to the Bush administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisionsF Mr Wheeler said FThose decisions will probably take time We canFt afford time It Fs what we donFt have Japan and Europe are already building the networks whil e weF re still trying to figure out where we should get itF he added ThenPresident Clinton launched the G initiative by executive memorandum i n October TR Oct Nov and Nov and Jan and The memorandum calls for the FCC to license the spectrum by Sept after a collaborative effort led by the FCC and the Commerce DepartmentF s National Telecommunications Information Administration But a key obstacle is that the bands being examined most closely for G applications already are occupied by military commercial and educational users Mr Wheeler said that the time it would take to allocate G spectrum made i t even more important for the FCC to lift the spectrum cap immediately The FCC asked for comments on the issue last week see separate story He said he had Fsome very profitable discussionsF with Bush transitio n team officials on spectrum issues although he wouldnFt elaborate He also s aid he was pleased that Donald L Evans stressed the importance of allocating G spectrum in his Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of commerce earli er this month TR Jan Mr Wheeler said another key issue for the coming year was finding ways to use wireless technologies to bridge the Fdigital divideF He stresse d that the gap wouldnFt Fbe bridged by just pumping more money into existing subsidy programsF although he said changes in the universal service program wer e needed On other issues Mr Wheeler said CTIA also hoped there would be congressional or FCC action on Internet privacy

Nextel said the transition would give it about megahertz of SMR spectrum in the and MHz bands in of the top US markets Commission Examines Merits Of Lifting CMRS Spectrum Cap The FCC is reexamining whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum wireless carriers may hold in any one market The Commission also is considering whether it should eliminate its cellular crossinterest rule In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week the FCC asked for comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained modified or eliminated to comply with the publicinterest standard set forth in section of the Communications Act as amended Specifically the agency is soliciting views on whether Fmeaningful econ omic competitionF in the commercial mobile radio service CMRS market has rendered spectrum aggregation limits including the cellular crossinterest rule unnecessary Under the agencyFs rules carriers arenFt allowed to hold more than megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and MHz in rural markets The cellular crossinterest rule restricts an entityFs ownership interest in cellular carriers operating in the same market The FCC wants to know whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the mark et The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes Fmeaningful economic competitionF under section and how competitive conditions ha ve changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in In the largest metropolitan areas where seven in Americans live at lea st five mobile telephone carriers are offering service the agency noted last week As a result it said prices are declining coverage areas are expanding and new service packages are being offered It wants to know if there are publicinterest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of suc h competitive developments Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap saying it has thwarted the US wireless industryFs deployment of thirdgeneration G services placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors Some smaller carriers however have asked the FCC to retain the cap saying it Fs needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger counterparts In a broad review of the cap conducted in the FCC decided to retain t he restriction although it eased the limit in rural markets TR Sept At the time it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against excessive concentration in the CMRS market preserving competition and the consumer benefits it had produced It also determined in that the cellular crossinterest restriction was necessary to protect competition The agency eased the rules somewhat however permitting some degree of crossinterest In November the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its biennial review TR Nov The notice of proposed rulemaking adopted Jan and released Jan in Wireless Telecommunications docket stems from that review Comments are due days after the notice Fs publication in the Federal Register and replies are due days after that In a separate statement Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth said that h e supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have conclude d that the cap should be lifted FThe use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues to search for a corresponding competitive illF he said FI have grown impatient with the CommissionFs repeated reexaminations of these issues without substantial alterations in our policy approachF Industry Praises Review Thomas E Wheeler president and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association said that lifting the cap was crucial while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate G bands winds through the regulatory process see separate story Mr Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to additional spectrum was necessary for the US to maintain its leadership i n the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencie s for G services setting aside twice as much spectrum as the US has he said The Personal Communications Industry Association however has said the cap is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market Mr Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K Powell had said he would favor lifting the spectrum cap FClearly in some of the opinions that heFs written in the spectrum proceeding heFs asked the question Why should this continueF Mr Wheeler said FWeFre hopefulF ThenCommissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November but said he tended to agree with Commissioner FurchtgottRothFs conclusion that the cap F has outlived its usefulnessF Notice Explores Alternatives In its rulemaking notice the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched For example it asks whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services It also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are offering service The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat alreadylicensed spectru m differently from frequencies licensed in the future FAs a general matt er we believe that newly available CMRSsuitable spectrum either should be excluded from the spectrum cap or if it is included that the cap should be adjusted accordinglyF the Commission said The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would affect its authority to review licensetransfer requests under section d of the Act If it makes such changes to the cap it wants to know whether it could or should Fincorporate other methodsF into its licensetransfer review to prevent consolidations Fthat would eliminate the benefits brought by competitionF It also seeks comments on whether removing the cap would place more of a burden on the FCC and industry in the review of license transfers If the Commission decides to keep the spectrum cap for now it wants to kno w what further market developments could make the cap unnecessary and whether it should set a FsunsetF date for the restrictions Regarding the cellular crossinterest rule the FCC asked whether the restriction was still necessary to prevent cellular carriers from merging i n markets where there is little or no other competition Bookham Technology plc

Qwest Corp that the FCC erred by focusing on the companyFs market shar e when considering its request to be freed from FdominantFcarrier regu lation of certain services The US Court of Appeals in Washington last week remanded to the FCC a order rejecting a U S WEST request to forbear from applying such regulation to the companyFs specialaccess and highcapacity dedicated transport offerings in

forbear from applying regulations deemed no longer necessary The court explained that the FCCFs order Frests solely on the view th at because U S WEST offered no reliable data on market share the petition for forbearance failed to make a prima facie showing that sufficient competitio n existed to satisfy section F But in relying so heavily on marketshare data the FCC Fdeparted from i ts traditional nondominance analysis without explanationF the court said The FCCFs decision to rely on that data Fmay well be reasonable but unti l the Commission has adequately explained the basis for this conclusion it has n ot discharged its statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act F the court said In the past the FCC had Fgone so far as to view market share as irrelev ant where there was other evidence that a carrier lacked market powerF the court said FWere this the first time the FCC was asked to consider whether a carrie r was dominant in a given market the explanation provided by the Commission in t he forbearance order may well have been accurateF it said FBut it is not the first time that the Commission has addressed this issueF The court said it might be FreasonableF for the FCC to demand a showi ng on market share in every inquiry on dominant regulation But it is Fnot reasonable for the Commission to announce such a policy without providing a satisfactory explanation for embarking on this course when it has not followed such a policy in the pastF it said Court Nixes IXCsF Claims As was apparent during oral arguments TR Dec the court was unconvinced by the arguments of ATT and WorldCom Inc which had challeng ed the order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for so me services In the forbearance order the FCC

however that the FCC couldnFt use its pricing flexibil ity rules as a substitute for its statutory mandate to consider requests for forbearance FCongress has established section as a viable and

Other States Accepted The FCC also offered clues about how it would view future applications that rely on a Bell companyFs performance in one state to show its compliance with the section mandates in another state There were no independent thirdparty tests of SWBTFs operation support systems OSSs in Kansas a nd Oklahoma but the company did provide thirdparty verification that those systems were the same as the OSSs used in Texas The FCC said that such an approach was appropriate given that the Texas proceeding served as Fa precursor and a modelF for the proceedings in Kansas and Oklahoma The FCC also was clear about the types of issues it would recognize in opponentsF filings on future interLATA applications It noted that the statutory day review period was designed as a Ffasttrack

previously ruled that requesting carriers can Ft use EELs to provide exchange access services exclusively The FCC had imposed that prohibition in response to incumbent local exchang e carriersF fears that competitors could use EELS to avoid paying special access charges TR Sept The Commission later extended the prohibition and promised to revisit the issue early this year TR June In a Jan public notice seeking comments on the issue Common Carrier docket the FCC asked if the exchange access and local exchange markets were Fso interrelated from an economic and technological perspec tive that a finding that a network element meets the FimpairF standard und er section d of the Telecommunications Act of for the local exchange market would itself entitle competitors to use that network elemen t solely or primarily in the exchange access marketF The FimpairF standard requires the FCC to evaluate whether the failur e to unbundle each network element would impair competitorsF ability to provi de service The FCC asked whether the local exchange and exchange access markets are F economically and technically distinctF If the markets are distinct do es lack of access to looptransport combinations impair requesting carriersF ability to provide special access services the FCC asked It asked about the availability of Falternative elementsF aside from those offered by the incumbents It asked whether it should treat special access and private line services as a single market The FCC also sought comment on the nature of the special access and private line markets for business and residential endusers FIn some markets particularly those markets serving highvolume business customers it may b e practical and economical for carriers to compete using selfprovisioned facilitiesF the FCC said But in residential and smallbusiness market s F the delay and cost associated with selfprovisioning will preclude carriers from serving that market without access to unbundled network elementsF The FCC also asked whether requesting carriers should be permitted to combi ne unbundled network elements with tariffed access services purchased from incumbents That kind of commingling is now prohibited by FCC rules FSpecifically if a requesting carrier converts special access circuits to combinations of unbundled network elements we ask parties to comment on whether such circuits may remain connected to any existing access service circuits without regard to the nature of the traffic carried over the acces s circuitsF it said Comments on the public notice are due days after its publication in the Federal Register replies are due days after publication Pole Attachment TELRIC Rates To Be Challenged in High Court The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases involving lengthy disputes over FCC rules One case stems from a challenge of the FCCFs methodology for setting rates for interconnection and unbundled network elements UNEs In a separate case the court will consider whether the agency has authority to regulate the rates utility companies charge wireles s and cable TV service providers for attaching equipment to their utility pol es Oral arguments in the cases havenFt been scheduled yet As she has done in a number of other telecomrelated cases Justice Sandra Day OFConnor recus ed herself from the courtFs deliberations In the first case a federal appeals court had overturned the FCCFs use of TELRIC totalelement longrun incremental cost pricing rules for setting rates for interconnection and UNEs TR July The high court said it would focus on the following questions Whether the TELRIC methodology is unlawful under section d of th e Telecommunications Act of Whether the Act or the Ftakings clauseF of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution requires incorporation of an incumbent local exchange carrier Fs ILECFs historical costs in its UNE rates and Whether section c of the Act prohibits regulators from requirin g that ILECs combine certain previously uncombined network elements at the request of a new market entrant The consolidated cases beginning with Verizon Communications Inc v FCC et alno came from the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit St Louis In what many incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs considered a victory the Eighth Circuit last year overturned the FCCFs TELRIC pricing rules But the court didnFt go so far as to agree with I LECs that rates for interconnection and UNEs must be based on historic costs In the second case the Supreme Court will consider whether the Fpole attachmentF provisions of the Communications Act of as amended ap ply to cable TV facilities that also are used to provide highspeed Internet access and to equipment used to provide wireless services The US Court of Appeals for the th Circuit Atlanta had held that the FCC didnFt have authority to regulate the rates utilities can charge for facilities that Internet or wireless service providers attach to their pole s TR April The pole attachment provisions apply only to cable T V and wireline telephone services the appeals court ruled The Supreme Cour t has consolidated the various appeals of the th Circuit decision under National Cable TV Association Inc v Gulf Power Co et alcase no Supreme Court Again Refuses To Hear State Immunity Cases The US Supreme Court has refused to review an appeals court ruling that denied state regulatorsF claims of immunity from federal lawsuits regard ing carrier interconnection The interconnection provisions are included in th e Telecommunications Act of The th Amendment to the US Constitution grants states immunity from federal lawsuits but a Supreme Court decision Ex parte Youngcreated an exception for lawsuits seeking to prevent an ongoing violation of federa l law by state officials The high courtFs action last week left in place a ruling by the US Cou rt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Chicago that the Ex parte Young exception applies to lawsuits involving carrier interconnection proceedings This isnFt the first time the Supreme Court has refused to take on such a case But it is the first time itFs been confronted by state immunity c laims extending not just to arbitration and approval of carrier interconnection agreements but also to enforcement of such pacts and review of F statements of generally available termsF SGATs according to a Wiscons in Public Service Commission official In the case the Supreme Court rejected last week the Wisconsin PSC and the Illinois Commerce Commission separately had sought review of a decision by the Seventh Circuit TR July The circuit court had ruled that the commissionsF actions regarding interconnection agreements SGATs an d enforcement of agreements werenFt immune from federal court review Last fall the Supreme Court refused to hear a case that arose in the Sixth Circuit and involved the Michigan Public Service Commission TR Oct The Michigan case didnFt cover an SGAT review or enforcement of an interconnection agreement In addition to the Sixth and Seventh circuits the th andFmost recentl yFthe Fifth circuits have ruled against state immunity claims in interconnection cases TR June and Jan The Supreme Court is less likely t o review cases when there is agreement among the various circuit courts that have dealt with the issues involved The FCC recently stepped in to preempt the Virginia Corporation Commission Fs authority to arbitrate and approve interconnection agreements because the state regulators had Ffailed to actF TR Jan The Virginia commission had cited fears that its actions would be deemed subject to federal court review In the aftermath of the Supreme CourtF s refusal last week to consider state claims of immunity for their interconnection enforcement actions one state commission source suggested that other states might decide to follow VirginiaFs path As she has done in other telecomrelated cases Supreme Court Justice Sandr a Day OFConnor recused herself from deliberations in last weekFs decisi on not to review the Seventh CircuitFs ruling FNetBased Directory Publishers Can Access LEC Data FCC Says The FCC has expanded the category of competitors entitled to access local exchange carriersF LECsF subscriber listing information LECs now must provide Internetbased directory publishers with nondiscriminatory access t o those databases The Commission said the new rules would promote competiti on in the directory service market The FCC declined to restrict the manner in which Internet directory publishers may display

database access under section The FCC refused to limit the manner in which a DA provider may use the incumbent LECsF subscriber information It said that neither competitiv e nor incumbent LECs are subject to such limits on their use of subscriber information LECs arenFt required to provide nondiscriminatory access to their nonloc al directory listings Fsince third parties have the same opportunity as t he LECs to secure the information directlyF the FCC noted However if a LEC is providing its national DA information to any other DA provider it must make the same information available to competing DA providers without discrimination The FCC declined to set a pricing structure for DA information but said sta te regulators werenFt precluded from doing so F Analysts See

licenses TR July Wireless Industry Seeks Changes In AntennaCollocation Agreement Two wireless industry trade groups are seeking changes in a draft agreement designed to streamline the review of antenna collocations on historic sites The industry groups say the changes are needed to ensure that the pact accomplishes its goal But a historic preservation group says the agreemen t would result in harm to historic properties The agreement was drafted pursuant to the National Historic Preservation A ct NHPA by the FCC the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP a nd a telecommunications working group that includes state historic preservatio n officers federal officials and wireless industry representatives TR Nov The FCC said it expected to take action on a final agreement on or about Jan The pact restricts the conditions under which state or tribal historic preservation officers would review antennas for their potential effect on historic properties or sites Wireless industry officials say they hope to of new antenna applications would be freed from the review process CTIA Attacks Agreement As drafted the agreement Fdoes not streamline the regulatory process fo r collocationsF the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Associationsai d in comments filed at the FCC last week Instead it Fthreatens to actually impede collocationF CTIA noted that under current FCC rules licensees are responsible for determining whether an antenna would affect a historic property FHowev er under the proposed national programmatic agreement any person whether qualified or not at any time can allege at the FCC that the proposed collocation has an adverse effect on historic propertiesF prompting a r eview before further construction can proceed CTIA said FSuch a provision undermines the FCCFs efforts to streamline the coll ocation process It also fails to recognize that the effects of collocations on historic properties are categorically minimal and unlikely to raise histor ic preservation issues not already addressed in the proposedF national programmatic agreement CTIA said that only in Fwelldefined and limited circumstancesF such as a substantial increase in the size of an antenna should a collocated facilit y be subject to review Otherwise the burden should be on ACHP and historic preservation officers to prove that an antenna will harm a historic propert y CTIA argued In addition the trade group said the FCC should ensure that future environmental assessments are processed in accordance with the Commission Fs own rules CTIA said decisions by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau F could be interpreted to suggest that licensees take steps required by neith er the CommissionFs rules nor the NHPAF In its comments the Personal Communications Industry Associationsaid that while it strongly supported the aim of the programmatic agreement Fsome necessary amendmentsF would ensure that the pact would Ftruly benefit all parties and advance the common goals of achieving the rapid buildout of th e nationFs indispensable telecommunications network while at the same time protecting the nationFs invaluable historic resourcesF PCIA said the draft agreement on which the FCC sought comments Fpreserve s much of the substanceF of an earlier version of the pact that was approv ed by the telecom working group But provisions added in the latest draft differ from Fthe intent of the partiesF previous agreementsF and Frequ ire clarification correction or modificationF it said Among the amendments PCIA suggested were changing the effective date of the agreement to the date it is published it proposed March unless an earlie r date is possible It also suggested changes in language that it says would limit which entities could mount antennas on towers And it wants to clari fy that compliance with the agreement constitutes compliance with the NHPAF s and the ACHPFs rules The Jefferson County Colo Historical Commissionalso opposed the programmatic agreement but for different reasons It said the pact would weaken the NHPA and the National Environmental Preservation Act It said t he collocation of antennas should not be permitted without environmental assessments The draft agreement Fplaces the wireless industry above the law that pro tects structures and American citizens that use themF the historical commissi on added The Telecommunications Industry Association has published The Telecommunications Industry Association has publishedan interim standar d that defines the messaging required to support Phase II Fenhanced F E systems The standard is called TIAEIAISJSTD Carriers Others See Problems In FCCFs IDNumber Proposal Carriers and broadcasters gave a lukewarm reception to the FCCFs plan to require each regulated entity to use a unique identifying number on certain filings Many carriers and others said the planned system was duplicative of existing registration programs and suggested ways to simplify the FCCFs process for tracking regulatory filings The FCC had proposed making mandatory a previously voluntary system under which anyone doing business with the agency would use a digit FCC registration number FRN obtained from the Commission Registration System In a notice of proposed rulemaking released in Managing Director docket last December the FCC suggested that the FRN be required on all regulatory fee payments waiver petitions auction payments and other filings and submissions TR Dec Parties would be responsible f or maintaining the accuracy of the information in the Commission Registration System database In comments filed on the proposal last week many carriers said they supported the FCCFs goal of efficiently tracking filings and fees but disagreed with just how the plan should be implemented Parties already use a taxpayer identification number TIN on many of their FCC filings including those on which the Commission has suggested using th e FRN Verizon Wireless said FThe need for another Funique identifyin g numberF is unclearF it said The confidentiality of TINs is important Verizon said Fbut this factor does not appear crucial since as the Commission says the information in the Commission Registration System is for Commission use only and will not be published or distributedF Cingular Wireless LLC suggested instead that the FCC do away with its use o f TINs when it institutes the mandatory FRN system It said that financial a nd personal information can be revealed and Fa personFs FidentityF can be F stolenF if his or her TINF is obtained It also criticized the FCC f or the lax security it gave partiesF TINs FInadvertently filed copies cont aining TIN information have been discovered in the CommissionFs public referenc e room on more than one occasionF Cingular said It recommended that the FCC assign FRNs only to parties that request one rather than having the Commission assign FRNs as it issues bills or other notifications The latter approach could Fresult in duplicative FRNs by large business entities who control numerous applicants and licenseesF it added The Walt Disney Co had similar reservations about how the FRNs would be assigned It said that under the voluntary FRN system when a parent compa ny made a joint filing that included regulatory fees for more than one subsidiary only the FRN of the parent company was associated with the payments and the FRNs of the subsidiaries appeared to be unused by the syst em This can lead to the misperception that the subsidiaries still owe the fees Disney said FThe CommissionFs filing systems should be able to prop erly credit payments made on behalf of a licensee that is a subsidiary of anothe r entity regardless of the source of paymentF it added Qwest Communications International Inc criticized the Funforgiving ma nner in which the Commission proposes to implement its FRN proposalF The FC C had suggested that it would reject filings that fail to include an FRN where on e is required which could result in the filingFs dismissal or the FCCF s refusal to accept an application Qwest said such an approach was Foverly harshF and suggested that the FCC F modify its proposed rules to allow filing parties a minimal period of time eg five calendar days to correct a filing or application that lacks an FRNF The National Exchange Carrier Association Inc said that it submits filin gs on behalf of more than carriers and that it was concerned about the F CC suggesting that one entity could obtain multiple FRNs FThe Commission should make clear that as authorized filing agent for its various tariffparticipating members NECA will submit its own FRN with each tariff filing requiring a fee payment but that submission of FRNs for each participating carrier in NECAFs tariff is not necessaryF NECA said If the FCC allows single entities to obtain multiple FRNs Fit should at a minimum establish a system to link related entitiesF NECA said Broadcasters already are required to register separately for four different FCC systems the National Association of Broadcasters said The FCC should F step back and assess its electronic filing and database systems on a holist ic levelF NAB said FAlthough each bureau has developed software progr ams to accommodate their particular needs there is no mechanism by which the systems are crossreferencedF The FCC should explore ways to Fcentr alizeF its identification process NAB concluded Building Owners Carriers Spar over FCC Proposal To Block Service Extend B an on Exclusive Pacts As the FCC considers another slate of proposals designed to help carriers obtain access to multitenant structures building owners and competitive telecom service providers are escalating the battle theyFve been fightin g for the last several years The issue this time around is whether the FCC should take steps specificall y targeting multitenant residential buildings The agency previously has limited the scope of its actions to commercial buildings The FCC recently adopted rules in Wireless Telecommunications docket designed to help competitive local exchange carriers CLECs obtain access to multitenant structures Among other things the Commission barred exclusiv e contracts between telecom service providers and owners of multitenant commercial buildings TR Oct When it adopted those rules the FCC suggested that it would need to take more steps It issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM askin g whether it should extend its ban on exclusive contracts to apply to multitenant residential buildings and bar incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs from serving buildings where the owner prevents CLEC acces s In its comments filed last week the Real Access Alliance which represents building owners said the FCC already had concluded that it lacked authorit y to Fregulate the real estate industryF But in the further NPRM the FCC asks whether it can Fachieve the same g oal through the draconian measure of ordering telecommunications providers to c ut off service in buildings whose owners do not comply with the CommissionF s wishesF it said FWhether the Commission regulates building owners directlyFas propose d in the original notice of proposed rulemaking in this docketFor indirectly as proposed in the further notice makes no difference because the FCC lacks jurisdiction over buildingaccess agreementsF the alliance said FAgreements for building access are agreements for the use of real estat e and therefore outside the CommissionFs purview even

prohibitF building o wners from F unreasonably discriminating among facilitiesbased carriersF it said ATT Corp called for a nondiscriminatory access rule allowing a CLEC to F institute proceedings that if successful could result in an order prohibiting a LEC from providing telecommunications servicesF to any bui lding that refuses to allow Freasonable nondiscriminatory access to competing carriersF The FCC has the authority under sections and of the Communications Act of to stop LECs from serving buildings whose owners engage in discriminatory practices ATT said FThe fact that such regulations ha ve an indirect effect on building ownersFnamely in encouraging them to prov ide their tenants with the telephony choices they deserveFdoes not divest th e Commission of jurisdictionF it said In joint comments Carolina BroadBand Inc RCN Telecom Services Inc an d Utilicom Networks LLC complained that the Fentrenched incumbent local exchange carriers and incumbent cable TV providers frequently misuse thei r established positions to block competition through such means as exclusive contracts with building owners and managersF They noted that the FCCFs further rulemaking notice had said the record didnF t provide a sufficient basis upon which to decide whether barring exclusive contracts in the residential market would be beneficial or detrimental to growth FThere are many competitive obstacles raised by such exclusive arrangements not the least of which is that the ultimate captive tenant mu st wait until the expiration of the contract before obtaining the superior services of another providerF they said Cox Communications Inc cited barriers it encounters when trying to gain access to buildings including Fmonetary demandsF from building owner s and F onerous nonfinancial terms and conditionsF It urged the FCC to adopt a F simple rule that prevents any incumbent from obtaining access to a multitenant building on terms more favorable than those available to any other carrierF BLEC Sees Residential Commercial Differences BLEC CoServ LLC said the FCCFs Freservation about extending the ban o n exclusive arrangements from the commercial to the residential market is warrantedF Residential leases are much shorter than business leases a nd relocation costs are lower for residences it said Residential customers therefore have a Fgreater degree of flexibility in mitigating or simpl y avoiding any limitsF a building owner may put in place with exclusive telecom service agreements it concluded Cypress Communications Inc an Atlantabased BLEC said the FCC should ba r ILECs from signing discriminatory access arrangements with building owners F Such a rule is necessary because ILECs have market power and therefore possess an advantage over CLECsF it said A nondiscrimination requirement applied to CLECs is FunnecessaryF Cy press said because they Flack market power and building owners do not have a n incentive to discriminate on the CLECsF

FCC Says ATU Must Refund M For Misallocating Costs The FCC has ordered an Alaskan local exchange carrier to refund GCI Communications Inc million in damages plus interest to make up for having improperly allocated certain costs to the interstate jurisdiction fo r separations purposes Local exchange carriers must jurisdictionally separa te costs related to facilities that are used for both interstate and intrastat e services so that federal and state regulators can associate the costs with revenues from the appropriate jurisdiction The FCC said Alaska Communications Systems Inc dba ATU Telecommunications had wrongly allocated to the interstate jurisdiction th e trafficsensitive costs of carrying Internetbound calls The FCC also sai d ATU unlawfully exceeded its allowed rate of return on its investment to provide interstate access services during the F monitoring perio d The FCC ordered ATU to revise its tariffs and monitoring reports to reflect the fact that the FCC considers ISPbound traffic to be intrastate in natur e for separations purposes The FCC also found that ATU improperly calculated Fdialequipment minute sF DEM for interoffice calls during that same monitoring period FBy allocating ISP traffic costs to the interstate jurisdiction for separations purposes and by counting one DEM rather than two DEMs for each minute of interoffice calls ATU erroneously inflated its interstate cost baseF t he FCC said in an order released last week in Enforcement file MD GCI also had complained that ATUFs tariffs were unjust and unreasona ble in violation of section b of the Communications Act of because they permitted ATU to exceed its prescribed rate of return and that by assigning Internetbound traffic costs to the interstate jurisdiction ATU unjustly and unreasonably imposed charges on GCI for a service to which it did not subscribe The FCC dismissed those two complaints saying they wer e F mootF and based on the same facts as the complaints on which it ruled in GCIF s favor The FCC said that assigning the costs of Internetbound traffic to the intrastate jurisdiction for separations purposes was Fa legal requiremen tF under rules it established in a order regarding MTS message telephone service and WATS market structure It noted that it had affirmed that leg al requirement in a series of orders most recently in its

FCCFs setaside rules for small businesses also known as Fdesign ated entitiesF DEs have drawn controversy since before the reauction began and are expected to remain a contentious issue The day before the sale began one DE Allegheny Communications Inc aske d the US Court of Appeals in Washington to block the reauction saying the FCC had failed to review the ownership of bidders classified as DEs to

of the cancellation of its licenses Oral arguments on its appeal in the DC Circuit are scheduled for March The FCC has conditioned the award of those licenses in the reauction on the outcome of NextWaveFs court ca se The other licenses sold in the reauction were reclaimed from other bankrupt carriers returned or unsold at previous auctions Analysts Industry Assess Results Meanwhile industry

said the New York City bids rivaled the huge bids seen in last yearFs thirdgeneration G spectrum auctions in the United Kingdom and Germany which raised more than billion TR May and Aug a nd Before

Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission develop its own plan for Verizon Pennsylvania Inc to split up its wholesale and retail operations In his recommendation to the PUC the ALJ criticized VerizonFs FalternativeF plan for not going far enough to separate the companyFs business functions and for being too full of h oles to implement In the PUC ordered the retailwholesale split as part of a Fglobal orderF settling a number of proceedings on issues ranging from reciproca l compensation to universal service TR Aug Also last year Verizon proposed a plan that would allow it to avoid a complete split of it s company by separating the business functions but keeping the company structurally intact TR July Administrative Law Judge Wayne L Weismandel last week recommended giving Verizon a year to create separately operating retail and wholesale affiliates Under his recommendation the two affiliates would be required to maintain separate books records staffs and officers The retail affiliate would not be permitted to obtain financing Fthat would permit a creditor upon default to have recourse to the assets of the Verizon Pennsylvania Inc wholesale affiliateF Under the plan the two affil iates would be required to conduct transactions Fon an armFslength basis F The ALJ said that VerizonFs alternative plan didnFt propose a true wholesaleretail separation but rather a Flineofbusiness split th at does not mitigate the anti competitive dominant market power Verizon currently exercises as a result of its base of legacy monopoly customers F He also blasted the telco for not supplying cost analysis or data to suppor t many of its conclusions FDue to VerizonFs failure to comply with the commissionFs orders i n this proceeding the commission is left with no choice but to direct structural separation of specific elements as the commission deems appropriateF A LJ Weismandel said CompetitorsF Plans Criticized Too Competitors including ATT Corp and WorldCom Corp had submitted

carriers say they generally support the FCCFs proposals to strea mline procedures governing pro forma assignments and transfers of international service authorizations although they also suggest further modifications of the rules But one major provider is asking the FCC to continue requiring foreign affiliates of carriers receiving such authorizations to settle traffic with US carriers at or below settlement rate FbenchmarksF Parties offered their views in comments filed at the FCC last week in response to an International docket notice of proposed rulemaking T R Dec To ease the regulatory burden on international carriers the FCC had propos ed to make its procedures for international service authorizations granted und er section of the Communications Act more like those it uses for assignmen t and transfer of control of commercial mobile radio service CMRS licenses The FCC also tentatively had concluded that it no longer needed to require carriers to comply with its international settlement rate benchmarks as a condition of granting them section authorizations to provide facilitiesbased international private line services It had proposed to stop requiring dominant international carriers to seek prior agency approval before discontinuing service on a route Fexcept w here a carrier possesses market power for international service in the USF In its comments on the FCCFs rulemaking proposal WorldCom Inc said i t supported streamlining and harmonizing the CommissionFs rules But it a sked the agency to retain the benchmark condition for facilitiesbased service t o affiliated markets until Jan ThatFs the last of several deadlines for US carriers to settle traffic with foreign carriers at or below the applicable benchmark rate the FCCFs benchmark order had set different deadlines for various groups of countries FThe incentive for unlawful oneway bypass remains a serious issueF WorldCom said FBy removing this condition the Commission would make it easier than ever for a dominant foreign carrier to circumvent unlawfully the settlement rate benchmarksF It added that it would be difficult for the Commissio n to detect evasion by carriers without the mandate Verizon Communications IncFs international carrier affiliates backed t he streamlining proposals FIn an increasingly competitive environment simplification and streamlining of outdated rules are essential to assure that US carriers are able to compete in the world marketF Verizon sai d It suggested the FCC go further and streamline other rules affecting international service authorizations as well It urged elimination of the following requirements Prior notification for affiliation with nondominant foreign carriers Identification of interlocking directorates with foreign carriers Quarterly international traffic reports required under section of the CommissionFs rules and Amendments of international authorizations when a Bell company receives FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transpor t area service in a particular state Verizon Wireless supported changing the rules concerning pro forma assignments and also asked the FCC to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirements mandated by section c Cingular Wireless LLC also backed making section application procedures more like those used for CMRS licenses It

while building networks acquiring other companies a nd trying to enter new markets Determining whether they can pay those and future debts is the job of creditrating agencies like MoodyFs Investors Service Robert Ray a senior vice president in the telecom technology and media group at MoodyFs tells TR that some of the biggest names in telecom li ke ATT Corp are in danger of losing top credit ratings and having to pay mo re interest in their next round of funding An edited transcript of our interview with Mr Ray follows TR What does MoodyFs do WhatFs your role Ray IFm lead analyst for a number of highvisibility companies in medi a technology and telecommunications IFm responsible not only for assign ing ratings to companies but also for monitoring those ratings as companiesF business prospects ebb and flow to make sure that our ratings once assigne d continue to be accurate In case weFre no longer comfortable with the rating itFs my responsi bility to make a recommendation to change the rating of a company TR The news about telecom debt levels has been gloomy see separate story WhatFs your perspective on the financial health of the telecom sector Ray There have been a number of defaults and bankruptcies particularly among the CLECs competitive local exchange carriers There are a number of companies that have tried to enter the market Not all the business plans were fully funded As both the equity and the debt markets have become more restricted companies that didnFt have a fully funded business planFthat didnF t have enough money on hand or committed money from their bank group to cover thei r cash needs over the next to monthsFhave found themselves in liquid ity crunches relatively quickly TR On the equity side a lot of analysts were surprised by what happened in the telecom sector Is there a similar sense on the credit and debt side that investors and their advisers were caught by surprise Ray In the highyield area many of the companies had relatively low ratin gsF singleB or Caa Those ratings donFt necessarily anticipate a certainty of default but they do reflect a high degree of risk Even on the investmentgrade side however weFve seen some surprising developmentsFnot so much in terms of direction but in terms of speedF primarily in the pricing environment for long distance services from companies such as ATT and WorldCom Inc We were aware that those prices were going to come under pressure as the Ba by Bells began to get permission to offer long distance service in their home markets as usage moved from wireline to wireless service and as usage began moving from traditional circuitswitched networks to Internetdeliver ed voice While we knew there were a lot of pressures that were going to bring pricin g down in that market the degree of the falloff was a bit of a surprise even to us As a result the large long distance carriers have had to scale bac k their expectations for profitability in the voice business TR And as a consequence their credit ratings have come under downward pressure Ray Yes ATT has had its longterm rating lowered from A to A and tha t rating remains on review Certainly the pressures from the voice business were part of that But ATT is also in the process of breaking itself up into three separate businesses The review is not only focusing on some of the risks that weFve talked about but also the financial structure that each of these businesses will have going forward WeFve changed the outlook on Sprint Corp from stable to negative WorldCom retains an A rating and a stable outlook While theyFve had s ome pressure like the other players they had a little more flexibility under the current rating to absorb some of those pressures TR How big a deal is it to these companies to have their credit rating go down a step What effect does that have on their daytoday business Ray On the daytoday business it has relatively limited impact To the extent that they would be issuing new debt a lower credit rating normally would result in a higher interest rate The most critical rating for ATT is its shortterm rating of Prime If they didnFt have a Prime rating theyFd be severely limited in thei r ability to sell commercial paper to the money market funds Securities an d Exchange Commission rules limit the amount money market funds can invest in companies that donFt have toptier commercial paper ratings like Prime from at least two rating agencies FEd For a company whose commercial paper outstanding has been between billi on and billion that could result in a significant increase in ATTFs funding costs They would have to seek out for the most part a different group of investors TR Is ATTFs Prime rating under review Ray Yes it is Both the A longterm rating and our Prime shortterm rating are on review for possible downgrade TR Can you give me an example of what the cost of money might be to ATT through a money market fund v the nextbest alternative Ray The money market funds would just be one of a number of investors who would be buying ATTFs commercial paper So donFt get too caught up in their being the only source TR Percentagewise though how much better is commercial paper than the nextbest alternative Ray They would certainly have to pay higher rates To the extent that th ey were reliant on the money market funds for a substantial part of their commercial paper issuance those funds would have to be replaced by investo rs who are less constrained by the rating You can find those investors but they are obviously looking at a lower rating for a higher pricing So it Fs hard to speculate on specifically what any one company might have to pay TR It depends on the day of the week IFm sure Ray And it also depends on the size of the program the marketFs view of how safe the investment is how comfortable investors are with the company Fs prospects and how much similar paper there is A telecom issuer is not only competing against a full range of issuers goin g into the market itFs also competing against other telecom companies for access to the market Most investors set limits on how much theyFre wil ling to expose themselves to any particular industry Once they feel they have enough exposure to the telecom industry theyFre going to be less intere sted in putting that next dollar into telecoms rather than some other opportunit y The other thing weFve seen in the last couple of years is thereFs bee n tremendous need in the telecom industry for financing as companies have bui lt out their networks CLECs have been building networks A number of long distance networks have been built here in the United States Wireless networks are being built There are also international networks not only connecting countries but also within Europe and within AsiaFboth wirelin e and wireless In the US market alone there was over billion worth of media and telecom debt in the first months of compared to about billion in ThatFs just the straight debt market not including equities or convertible debts TR How do you determine a companyFs rating Ray We look at the business risks of a company We try to understand exactly what business theyFre in their competitive position and their strengths and weaknesses We also try to get a good understanding of management and what their appetites may be for business and financial risk We rate virtually all major companies in virtually every industry We also have a solid understanding of the industry broadly and where any particular company fits in terms of its cost structure market share management direction and strategic focus We also obviously do some statistical analysis Since weFre fixedinc ome analysts weFre focused more on ensuring that debt obligations get paid and trying to assess the probability that all obligations will be paid in full in a timely manner A fixedincome investor doesnFt necessarily have the upside that an equi ty holder does A fixedincome holder has one of two results if he buys a security at issuance and holds it to maturity He either gets paid or he doesnFt Even if the companyFs been fabulously successful he just gets his inter est on a regular basis and the principal at maturity If the company just struggles through and barely makes it heFs in the same situation So t hereF s not much upside on straight debt if youFre a buyandhold investor As fixedincome analysts our key measures are the companyFs ability to generate free cash ThatFs cash after meeting all fixed obligations li ke interest and dividends We also look at their ability to finance their capital spending requirements and their cashgenerating capability relative to their debt load If you look at two companies that are basically in the same industry and th at have similar sizes and market positionsFwith neither one possessing any particular competitive advantage in terms of new productsFthe one that h as the stronger cash generation relative to its debt obligations would have a higher rating Probably the most difficult part of our business is making sure that we are consistent in applying our ratings I want to make sure my strongest compa ny has the highest rating and my weakest company has the lowest rating ItFs also important to make sure that what I call an A an A or a Baa is equivalent to the ratings of anyone else in the corporate finance area whether theyFre covering auto companies or coal mines TR How much of your time is spent talking to management and trying to figure out their plans What happens during these talks Ray A large part of our analytical meetings with companies is spent tryin g to understand their strategy their philosophy and their appetite for business and financial risk and looking at what the company has done in th e past and how successful theyFve been in meeting goals that theyFve se t for themselves We look at their plans relative to others in the industry and try to make sure the strategy and the objectives theyFve set are reasonable and achievable The discussion quite frankly in the average meeting tends to be more about the companiesF products and business mix ItFs often beneficial having a longstanding relationship with a company Fs management You develop a sense of comfort regarding managementFs abili ty to forecast the risks they face to come up with plans to address those risks and to develop financial models that are achievable TR It must be an expensive prospect for a company to get its rating lowered and it also may be a bit of an embarrassment How do they react t o the possibility of a downgrade Ray We try to have a pretty good ongoing dialogue with a company so that itF s not a matter of calling them up one day and saying FOh by the way w eFre putting you on review for a downgradeF To the extent that we develop a reas of concern we like to bring them to the companyFs attentionFboth in our direct facetoface meetings and in regular ongoing dialogue over the phone Obviously no company is ever pleased to be put on review for a downgrade Our objective quite frankly is to make sure that they understand and appreciate the position weFve taken and that they know why weFre doin g what weFre doing Even though they ultimately may disagree with the action at least we want to make sure that they understand the logic behind the steps we take And we give them a chance to share with us their view as to why some of our concer ns may be less severe from their perspective TR Do you have any advice for telecom executives investors or regulators What needs to happen for the sector to climb out of its slump Ray For the long distance companies itFs a matter of continuing to ge t their costs in line as best they can knowing that their revenue is going t o continue to be under a lot of pressure for the foreseeable future In the wireless segment the key things are the ability of the wireless players to build out their networks at a reasonable cost and to attract highvalue customersFnot only for voice but also for the emerging wirele ss data marketsFwhile maintaining cost structures that will allow them to continue to be profitable There are more national wireless carriers now and we expect that developme nt will put pressure on pricing We donFt anticipate that itFs going to be as dramatic as the pressure weFve seen recently in the voice wireline secto r But the more competitors you have and the broader their coverage the great er the risk of continued pricing declines TR We havenFt talked much about the Bell companiesFthe ILECs incum bent local exchange carriers WhatFs your outlook for that sector Ray One argument that MoodyFs has been making in support of them for a long time is that they have direct contact with their customers and theyFre also the ones with the line into the house Our ratings on the ILECs are certainly the highest we have in the telecom area They are by and large a strong group of competitors whoFve demonstrated better stability in thei r customer base and revenue mix than the long distance carriers have TR Does the prospect of greater regulatory oversight figure into your calculations regarding the Bells Ray ThereFs a lot of regulatory oversight As they seek to get approv al to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service that process has taken a bit longer than we wouldFve expected We anticipated that once the first state and the second state fell other stat es would follow relatively rapidly Telecom SectorFs Dubious Debts Create Drag on Financial Markets The rumblings began in Europe The Bank of England issued warnings follow ed by the Bank of France The major creditrating agenciesFStandard Poor Fs MoodyFs Investors Service and Fitch ICBAFissued ominous reports On the one hand they sounded alarm bells while on the other they said FDonFt p anicF The reason for the caution flags is the level of questionable debt among telecom companies Pessimists fear that so many obligations will go unpaid that the telecom industry singlehandedly will tip the economies of several countries into recessionFas the US real estate industry did in the s when it built too much on borrowed funds before toppling like a rotten tree Even optimists admit that telecom debt is already a drag on the economy I tF s dampening the profits of banks and rippling through related sectors leavi ng experts to wonder how much more bad debt will ooze from the telecom industr y and how many defaults the economy can absorb FFears Are OverdoneF By some estimates telecom service providers have borrowed billion ove r the past three years including bonds and bank loans Analysts generally divide that debt into two sectors The bigger group has been generated by large carriers like ATT Corp British Telecommunications plc and France Telecom SA If one of those companies went under it would be a catastrophe But analysts donFt think thatFs likely TheyFre more concerned about smaller service providers like competitive local exchange carriers CLECs Fortunately those carriers arenFt tho ught to carry enough debt to bring down a major bank let alone an entire indust ry or an economy FAt this stage MoodyFs is not forecasting defaults by major telecoms F MoodyF s Investors service says in a recent report FOn the other hand defaul ts by more marginal operators cannot be excluded However if a bank is not massively exposed to such borrowers its credit strength should not be structurally hurt let alone the fundamentals of the banking systemF Fitch ICBA issued a similar statement FLarge profitable and creditwo rthyF telecom operators are responsible for the bulk of the debt load Fitch says FExposure to the riskier alternative operator sector is in relative te rms modestF FFears of a banking crisis are overdone in our viewF says Morgan St anley Dean Witter analysts Richard Crehan and Graham Secker in a report on Europe an telecom debt FThe vast majorityFabout Fof the debt raised in the last months is investment grade and unlikely to default While the amount of loans made to the telecom sector in Europe is unprecedented we do not thin k the telecom debt issue will sink financial marketsF Those assessments donFt mean there wonFt be pain for the telecom comp anies and their lenders on both sides of the Atlantic The danger for banks is that their books will look uglier their profits will sink and their stock prices will tank Bank of America Corp and First Union Corp for example recently missed their profit goals partly because of largerthanexpected loanloss provisions Disappointed Wall Street analysts downgraded both companies a nd their stocks slid While those developments donFt constitute a bank F crisisF banks arenFt benefiting from their association with languish ing telecom companies Telecom isnFt the only industry causing banks to spew red ink says Cred it Suisse First Boston Corp analyst Rosalind Looby Movie theater companies F dotcomsF and California electric utilities are doing their part too FWe are in the midst of a broader deterioration in commercial credit qua lity driven by loose lending standards adopted in the midsF Ms Looby comments in a recent report Banks traditionally were reluctant to fund moneylosing companies They changed tacks during the dotcom frenzy on Wall Street If they lent money to a young company some bankers reasoned that company might hire them for other financial services The risks were greater but the prospects for future revenue were tempting That was before those young companies fell on hard times CLECsFone of the harderhit sectors in the current economic slowdownFhave billion in loan commitments from US banks Credit Suisse First Boston estimates Skittis h banks have ways of dumping risky clients but the process can be expensive Ms Looby says FBankers attempting to sell any marginal CLEC credit into the distressed loan market today are likely to leave to of the loanFs face value on the tableF she continues FCLECrelated losses could be material for ba nks attempting to downsize their exposure in this areaF For now however many bankers are choosing to sit tight FIFm not s eeing a lot of sales into the distressed loan marketF says Robert H Johnson managing directorloan syndications for First Union Securities Inc Banke rs Fare not excitedF about holding onto some of the riskier telecom loan s but theyFre also not ready to take the financial hit that results from a F distressedF sale he says Furthermore bankers remain confident that theyFll collect the entire am ount on telecom loans even in the worst cases Mr Johnson says First Union for example still expects full repayment of its loans to two bankrupt CLEC sF ICG Communications Inc and NorthPoint Communications Group Inc Bankruptcy courts often find ways of restructuring debt that enables banks to emerge unscathed Mr Johnson says Meanwhile the telecom industry appears to be recovering Mr Johnson notes FWhile there still may be more bankruptcies the perspective in the bank ing industry is that things have bottomed outF he says FI believe we Fre at the bottomF Recovery Could Be Stymied Debtmarket analysts at Bear Stearns Co are less sanguine The debt market appears to have regained its footing Bear Stearns analysts say but the recovery could be stymied by fear uncertainty and market failures F The telecom sector remains prone to headline riskF they say suggesting that the struggling market wonFt be able to absorb bad news Debt markets are especially vulnerable in Europe where large carriers are selling FnoncoreF assets and holding initial public offerings IPOs of stock to raise badly needed funds Bear Stearns notes Those funds will help carriers reduce their debts and pay for expensive new wireless networks B ut what if nobody is willing to buy the assets or invest in the IPOs Many analysts view France TelecomFs IPO of its wireless subsidiary Oran ge plc as a crucial test of EuropeFs capital markets If stockmarket investors donFt support that IPO analysts fear that the budding recover y will wilt FIPOs and noncore disposals must succeedF Messrs Crehan and Secker of Morgan Stanley declare FThe situation has reached an impasse Telecom companies need to spend moreFon network buildout and upgradesFto rea lize a return on their original investment But financial markets are reluctant t o risk even more moneyF FIf the European equity markets do not support IPOs necessary capitalraising steps could be delayed refocusing investors and the rating agencies on credit ratingsF Bear Stearns says FDelayed plans might force the international telecom giants to turn to the banks at a time when the banks are more closely scrutinizing their loan portfoliosF Vendors Become Lenders The type of lending that seems to worry analysts most is vendor financing in which equipment vendors give carriers loans in exchange for guaranteed equipment orders Vendor financing was much less common before last April when the stock market still was the best source of funding for telecom companies When stock market investors closed their doors many telecom companies went to the bond market When bonds dried up they visited banks Rejected by banks many carriers turned to vendors Analysts are nervous because vendors sometimes arenFt qualified to judge creditworthiness and administer loan programs But the vendors are eager t o snag customers FOffering financing has quickly developed into a compet itive weapon by equipment manufacturers keen to take market shareF Messrs Cr ehan and Secker explain FThe aggressive expansion of vendor financing has raised fears that equi pment manufacturers could suffer like the banks should there be widespread defaultF Messrs Crehan and Secker said FArguably the equipment manufacturers are more exposed to this risk since by definition vendor financing is lending to companies that the banks and financial markets have refusedF Vendor financing worries already have stung some manufacturers Lucent Technologies Inc for example recently increased its provision for bad debts to million from million damaging its financial standing in the process TR Dec Vendor financing defaults wonFt hurt only vendors analysts say but als o could cause equipment manufacturers to turn around and default on their lendersFnot a positive development in a year when Standard PoorFs a lready expects an increase in defaults by debtladen telecom companies FTom Leithauser Conn Draft Decision Would Let SNET Drop Cable TV Business The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control has proposed letting Southern New England Telephone Co SNET and its video service subsidiary SNET Personal Vision Inc stop providing cable TV services in the state SNET a subsidiary of SBC Communications Inc had told the department tha t its hybrid fibercoaxial cable HFC cable TV network was unsuitable for ubiquitous fullservice telephony and that the videoonly deployment of th e HFC network was commercially impracticable TR Aug A draft department decision says the agency lacks the statutory authority t o require that SNET continue providing service It says the department also lacks the authority to force the transfer of SNETFs cable TV franchise o r video assets to another company as Connecticut Telephone Communications Systems Inc had requested last fall TR Sept Written exceptions to the draft decision are due Jan in docket The department will hold a Feb hearing if one is requested and plans t o issue a final decision Feb In the department modified the terms of SNETFs franchise which originally required the company to serve the entire state by September The recent draft decision says that transferring SNETFs modified franchi se

Expo in Washington last week see separate story that the overall prices paid at the sale were Fextremely highF Analysts speculated why Verizon Wireless had agreed to pay so much for the New York City spectrum It could be that the carrier wanted to ensure dominance in the wireless data market or to guarantee that competitorsF such as Cingular Wireless LLCFdidnFt land the valuable frequencies they t

taxes depreciation and amortization potential around wireless data than they have been in the past as they seek to explai n the billion increase in the debt loadF Indeed Credit Suisse First Boston last week downgraded Verizon CommunicationsF stock from a strong buy to a buy in part because of its need to raise cash to pay for the spectrum and the costs of building its wireles s network The

thirdgeneration G auctions in the United Kingdom per MHz pop and Germany per MHz pop last yea r which raised more than billion TR May and Aug and Verizon WirelessF bidding worked out to per MHz pop Mr Bensche s aid FWe believe that biding was rational and that an average of popM Hz was a reasonable amount for carriers to pay for the spectrum availableF Mr Rollins said Analysts Scrutinize Other Strategies HereFs a look at analystsF take on how the other largest carriers did at the auction ATT WIRELESS It didnFt win any licenses separately but will benefit f rom those won by its Fdesignated entityF DE or smallbusiness partner Alaska Native Wireless which bid billion for licenses Through that alliance analysts note ATT Wireless gained spectrum in Los Angeles and New York bringing its holdings to MHz in those markets It also added licenses in other major markets ATT Wireless told analysts last week that the additional spectrum would allow it to roll out a G system in additional markets In all the carrier says it will be able to deploy the G universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS technology in of the top markets In addition Mr Bensche noted that DE affiliates or subsidiaries of two other carriers with close ties to ATT WirelessFTriton PCS Holdings Inc and Dobson Communications CorpFalso won a total of licenses at the auction CINGULAR WIRELESS The carrier has equity in DE Salmon PCS LLC the numberthree bidder at the reauction with billion in bids on licenses Analysts say Salmon won licenses in a number of markets where Cingular needs to fill in holes in its footprint including Minneapolis Denver Portland Ore Norfolk Va Pittsburgh and Richmond Va It also won licenses that could shore up CingularFs spectrum position in other key markets including Los Angeles Dallas and Boston But it failed to win any spectrum in New York CityFa key market Cingul ar already has a MHz block of spectrum in the Big Apple thanks to a swap o f licenses with VoiceStream Wireless Corp announced before the auction TR Nov Mr Bensche said Cingular Fshould be comfortableF with that block unt il it can acquire more spectrum in New York City in the MHz band auction He called Cingularbacked SalmonFs decision not to remain in bidding for Ne w York City spectrum Fan act of bravery on behalf of Cingular shareholde rsF Ms Motz also commended Cingular for its FdisciplinedF bidding via Sa lmon F While the pressure was on for Cingular to win a New York license it was no t enough for the company to be pressured into paying more than it was willing F she said Salmon officials have said they intend to use the licenses for their own network although they would have the right to use CingularFs name and m ight establish roaming and operations agreements with the large carrier VoiceStream A VoiceStream subsidiary VoiceStream PCS BTA bid million for licenses Its DE affiliate Cook InletVS GSM V P offered million for licenses The companies filled important VoiceStream footprint holes in the Carolinas including Charlotte and Greensboro in North Carolina and Charleston and Columbia in South Carolina analysts said VoiceStream also picked up licenses in Texas the Pacific Northwest and th e Midwest Its auction success combined with its planned merger with Powertel Inc and recent spectrum swap with Cingular has helped it build a nationwide footprint Mr Bensche said Ms Motz said CingularFs and VoiceStreamFs auction results Fcould suggest that the two intend to work closely together on favorable roaming arrangements in the near future since each has what the other needs alread y built outF SPRINT PCS SprintCom Inc a Sprint PCS subsidiary dropped out of the reauction But SVC BidCo LP a DE that is owned by Sprint PCS won five licenses for million The licenses are in areas where analysts s ay Sprint PCS had only MHz of spectrumFTampa and Orlando in Florida Cincinnati and Dayton in Ohio and Norfolk Va Analysts note that Sprint PCS also secured additional spectrum in a swap wi th ATT Wireless announced before the auction They say that because it has such a strong spectrum position MHz of spectrum in the majority of its markets they arenFt surprised it wasnFt more aggressive in the sale NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS INC Nextel Spectrum Acquisition Corp a Nextel subsidiary dropped out of the reauction when bidding got too high as did Connectbid LLC a Nextel DE bidding partner controlled by cellular industry pioneer Craig McCaw Analysts were not surprised They said the auction d id not afford Nextel a chance to secure a full national footprint FThe prospect of holding only MHz of PCS spectrum in a handful of mar kets at high prices is not an ideal remedy to NextelFs current spectrum need F Mr Bensche said FWith an average of MHz of spectrum in the MHz band to operate it s iDEN system it would suit Nextel more to acquire a contiguous MHz on a nationwide basis rather than a piecemeal collection of propertiesF he said Analysts expect Nextel to continue acquiring MHz and MHz band spectrum and say it also could pursue licenses at the MHz band auction F Whatever the strategy the completion of the auction puts NextelFs competition in a much stronger position to better compete in both the voice and data markets leaving Nextel at a disadvantage for future servicesF Mr Bensche said Meanwhile last week Dana Frix an attorney for San AntonioFbased Allegh eny Communications Inc told TRthat company officials still were considering their options for contesting the auction results Allegheny which dropped out of the reauction before it was over when the prices got too high says the DE rules permitted large carriers to participate through Fshell entitiesF for licenses reserved for entrepreneurs Allegheny failed to persuade the US Court of Appeals in Washington to block the reauction the day before it began in December TR Dec The winning bidders in the reauction have until Feb to submit down payments the FCC said in a public notice released last week The bidders also must submit their FlongformF applications as well as form which includes ownership information by that date The FCC has said it would review ownership arrangements of winning auction bidders closely befo re granting licenses Of the licenses on the block in the reauction were reserved for qualified DEs and were open to all bidders Mr Bensche noted that the liberal capitalization rules for DEs allowed large companies to jump back a nd forth between bidding on FopenF and FclosedF licenses using bi dding credits for the open licenses through the DEs FIn reality this drove up the prices in the closed blocks to the same l evels as the open licenses being chased by the designated entitiesF Mr Bensc he concluded FIn fact analyzing all of the markets in which at the close of the auction one of the open licenses was won by a bidder with bidding credits we come to the conclusion that the closed blocks went for more than the open blocksF Meanwhile last week bankrupt NextWave Telecom Inc whose reclaimed licenses were snatched up at the reauction filed its reply brief with the US Court of Appeals in Washington in its case against the FCC In its brief NextWave repeated its argument that the cancellation of its licenses was prohibited by the US Bankruptcy Code Oral arguments are scheduled for March in NextWave Personal

officials to consult with other nations as they prepare for the International Telecommunication UnionFs World Radiocommunication Conference WRC FCC officials and industry representatives agree FOne of the best ways of achieving a tremendous amount at WRC is by listening to our compatriots in other countries listening to their thought s as to what should be doneF Commissioner Susan Ness said last week at th e opening meeting of an industry advisory committee helping the agency draft proposals for the WRC FAnd to the extent that we can work with these other countries to achiev e their goals at the same time weFre trying to formulate our goals weF re going to have a much more successful and less confrontational radio conference F Ms Ness added She noted that WRC would be the fourth such conference since she became a member of the Commission Donald Abelson chief of the FCCFs International Bureau agreed that the lesson the FCC had learned from past conferences Fis the sooner we get t o talk to our foreign colleagues and coordinate with them the better our proposals areF Mr Abelson said the advisory committee would be important because it would help the FCC develop WRC proposals it can present to other federal agencies such as the Commerce and State departments Those proposals eventually would be the subject of consultations with regulators from other countries leading up to WRC Peter A Tenhula senior legal adviser to Chairman Michael K Powell agree d that early planning was essential for a successful WRC Full Slate of Issues Among the issues the advisory committee wants addressed at WRC are spectrum for thirdgeneration G services also known as International Mobile Telecommunications IMT terrestrial wireless interactive multimedia services spectrum sharing in the gigahertz band aeronautical mobilesatellite services public protection and disaster relief interregional sharing issues for broadcasting satellit e services highfrequency broadcasting service and regulatory procedures governing satellite networks Much of the advisory panelFs work will be done by seven informal working groups focusing on specific issues said Brian Fontes chairman of the advisory committee and vice presidentfederal regulation at Cingular Wirele ss LLC Mr Fontes is a former FCC chief of staff who led the US delegation at the WRC Jennifer Warren senior directortelecom trade and regulatory affairs at Lockheed Martin Corp is the panelFs cochair Many of the issues the panel will explore are contentious Mr Fontes said F I know full well as a member of a competitive industry that thereFs a lo t of competition among the US industry interests and that competition will rea r its head in various debates and discussionsF he added FThere are a lso differences between government and industry about how spectrum should be usedF But after all the issues have been debated Mr Fontes said itFs import ant to reach a consensusFand to do so in time to allow consultations with ot her countries FWeFre going to have to recognize where we each come from and how we best can work cooperatively and constructively togetherF he said FNo more d o we have the luxury of waiting to the last moment to achieve the US objectives We must be prepared well in advanceF Julie Garcia director of the FCCFs WRC preparation team said the ag ency was listening to industry feedback about how to improve its conference planning FThis is an ongoing processF she said FWe will conti nue to look for ways that we can take the industryFs view into accountF US officials who participated in WRC last year felt that they were successful on issues such as broadcasting satellite service and IMT planning TR June Bureau OKs Satellite Operators For Intersatellite Communications The FCCFs International Bureau has modified the licenses of operators of geostationary orbit GSO satellite systems enabling them to provide fixed satellite services in parts of the Kaband The license modifications allo w them to operate intersatellite service links ISLs using that spectrum The bureau said that it could permit the operators to provide ISL services as a result of decisions made at the World Radiocommunication Conference WRC and in light of the operatorsF studies on sharing the ISL spect rum WRC resolved technical issues regarding GSO satellite transmissions and assigned the F gigahertz band for ISL use by fixed satellite service FSS providers The FCC subsequently reserved that spectrum for nongovernment use The bureau granted the ISL license modifications to PanAmSat Corp Teledes ic LLC Loral Corp Hughes Communications Galaxy Inc Astrolink Internation al LLC CyberStar Licensee LLC EchoStar Satellite Corp and WB Holdings LL C GE American Communications Inc and Motorola Inc In a series of For ders and authorizationsF released Jan the bureau assigned each operator a frequency In some cases it also set system buildout FmilestonesF t hat operators must meet to retain the modified licenses Section f of the FCCFs rules states that a Kaband GSO FSS licen see must begin construction of its first satellite within one year of grant begin construction of the remainder within two years launch at lea st one satellite into each of its assigned orbit locations within five years and launch the remainder of its satellites by the date required by the International Telecommunication Union The bureau also issued a Jan order modifying VisionStar IncFs lice nse to launch and operate a satellite system in GSO to provide FSSs The burea u gave VisionStar MHz of additional downlink operating frequencies for satellitetouser transmissions bringing its total to MHz DoJ FBI Want Foreign Control Of DT Limited by FCC Conditions The US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say they have reached an agreement with VoiceStream Wireless Corp and Deutsche Telekom AG that reduces the law enforcement national security and public safety risks of DTFs planned acquisition of VoiceStream In December the law enforcement authorities and the companies asked t he FCC to defer a decision on the transaction until the outstanding concerns could be resolved TR Dec DoJ and the FBI now say they wonF t oppose the FCCFs approving license transfers associated with the transac tion as long as the terms of their agreement with the carriers are conditions of the approval In a petition filed with the FCC in International docket DoJ and th e FBI said the agreement pays particular attention to the German government Fs control or influence over DT DT says the government is not involved in it s operations The German government currently owns of DT its interest i n the combined entity would decline to about after DTFs acquisitions o f VoiceStream and Powertel Inc Among other things the agreement stipulates that DT shall not disclose classified or sensitive information subscriber information or transaction al or call data to any foreign government It also requires DT officials to notify the FBI and DoJ if a foreign government attempts to participate in daytoday management of DT or exercise control of it in a way that interferes with the carrierFs obligations to abide by the agreement Th e agreement was reached Jan FAlthough the agreement does not eliminate every law enforcement nation al security or public safety risk posed by the proposed transactions it does reduce those risks while affording the companies treatment consistent with other carriers in like circumstancesF the FBI and DoJ said in their pet ition Intelsat Told To Disclose Privatization Info The FCCFs International Bureau has required Intelsat LLC to disclose cer tain informationFincluding its draft shareholderFs agreement and bylawsF to parties who agree to be bound by a protective order Intelsat LLC is the privatized entity slated to succeed the intergovernment al organization Intelsat this spring On Dec it asked for confidential treatment of FsupplementalF information it was filing in the FCCF s proceeding to determine whether the privatization complies with a US la w passed last year the OpenMarket Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act In its order released Jan the FCC required Intelsat LLC to file copies of the most uptodate versions of its novation agreement distribution agreement and related documents within seven days after the March Intelsat board of governors meeting The FCC also extended the deadlines for commenting on the supplemental filing Comments now are due Feb replies March and responses to replies March DonFt Exempt Foreign Agencies From Ex Parte Rules Carriers Say Only two carriers weighed in on the FCCFs proposal to exempt foreign regulators from rules requiring them to report on their communications with FCC officials but both vehemently opposed the plan They said the rules protect regulated entities by making the FCCFs deliberations Ftranspa rentF Communications from the US Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission regarding Fa telecommunications competition matter in a proce eding which has not been designated for hearing and in which the relevant agency is not a party or commenterF are exempt from the FCCFs rules requiring p arties to report such ex parte communications In December the FCC proposed widening that exemption to include Finternational and foreign government al bodies that exercise similar jurisdiction over relevant mattersF TRDec In a rulemaking notice released in General Counsel docket the FCC cited increased globalization and international mergers as reasons for the proposed rule change The FCC said the rule change would encourage F effective expedited and consistentF communications among antitrust and competition policymakers The Competitive Telecommunications Association said extending the exemption F would impair significantly both the dueprocess rights of parties participating in affected proceedings as well as the FCCFs ability to re nder a decision based on a complete recordF Communications between the FCC and foreign regulators raise different questions from those between the FCC and DoJ or the FTC CompTel said It argued that foreign regulatory bodies Foperate under laws and regulation s that may embody substantially different competition goalsF than the FCC pursues unlike DoJ or the FTC which operate under a Fcomplementary statutory schemeF Many foreign governments maintain interests or have close ties to Fcomme rcial enterprises that may be affected by the FCCFs decisions in merger cases F it continued And Vodafone Group plc through its business unit Vodafone Americas Asia Region Inc said the rationale behind the rule change the FCC cited was insufficient If the FCC wanted to communicate with foreign regulators F on general methods of analysis for example or general approaches to evaluati ng licenses transfersF those communications would not fall under ex parte rules The rulemaking notice Fdoes not explain why in the context of a specific proceeding the ex parte rules hinder exchange of informationF it said Vodafone questioned whether the FCC has authority under the federal Administrative Procedure Act to Fafford foreign government agencies the same treatment as domestic regulatory agenciesF The APAFs Fwhole re cordF and dueprocess safeguards that ensure that parties may comment on the entire record of a proceeding are underlying principles of federal agenciesF ex parte rules Vodafone said The APA makes an Fexpress distinctionF b etween US and nonUS government agencies it added Vodafone acknowledged that there might be situations in which disclosure of an interagency ex parte communication Fis not advisableF But it sai d the FCC should address those situations case by case Unlicensed International Carriers Given Days To Come Forward The FCCFs International and Enforcement bureaus have given carriers and operators days to turn themselves in if theyFve been offering international services or facilities without proper authorization The International Bureau doesnFt FexpectF to undertake enforcement act ions against violators that come forward and seek the required authorization bu t cases of noncompliance discovered after the threemonth period will be referred to the Enforcement Bureau the two bureaus said Their

auction of spectrum licenses in the megahertz band Bu t a group representing rural carriers and a major TV broadcaster say the acti on wasnFt necessary The decision to postpone the auction from March until Sept was needed F to provide additional time for bidder preparation and planningF and for other auction administrative reasons the FCCFs Wireless Telecommunications Bu reau said in a public notice released Jan The action came after Verizon Wireless and other large carriers cited a hos t of concerns they said could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the frequencies In a Jan letter to the

service licenses and the MHz band sale TRJan T he PCS reauction ended Jan TRJan and separate story Large carriers had supported in comments Verizon WirelessF request for a postponement some asked for the auction to be postponed even longer than t he six months Verizon Wireless had requested TRJan Other reasons the industry cited in urging a delay included concerns that TV broadcasters occupy large chunks of the spectrum to be licensed and additional time is needed to negotiate bandclearing agreements with them companies need more time to prepare for packagebidding rules that will be used for the first time in the auction and a highlevel effort to identify and allocate frequencies for thirdgeneration G services will affect carriersF interest in the MHz band Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth opposed the postponement noting tha t the FCC already had missed a Sept statutory deadline for depositing proceeds from the auction into the US Treasury FI am disappointed that the Commission has decided to postpone this auction once againF he said in a statement FWith each succeeding delay the cre dibility of our spectrum and auctionmanagement policies becomes more suspectF Commissioner Gloria Tristani who dissented from the FCCFs decision last year to postpone the auction to this March said she did not oppose the latest delay She cited the short time frame between the C and F block auction an d the MHz band sale FAt this point the scheduling problems before us are of a different nat ure and largely of this agencyFs own makingF she said FThe challeng es posed by the early auction of MHz spectrum need not be burdened further by unfortunate administrative miscalculations The bureau asserts that this delay is necessary to address these administrative mattersF Large Carriers Welcome Delay Verizon Wireless President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis F Strigl praised the FCCFs decision FI think the FCC made exactly the right moveF Mr Strigl said after a keynote address at the Comnet Conference Expo in Washington last week see separate story He said the presence of TV broadcasters in the band Fwill have a significant impact on the value of this spectrumF He added FAt this point I canFt tell you that the ne w spectrum has high valueF Broadcasters are expected to vacate the spectrum channels F as par t of their transition to digital TV but they donFt need to do so until at the earliest The uncertainty over when the frequencies will be available has created anxiety among wireless carriers considering bidding in the auction Thomas E Wheeler president and CEO of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association also praised the FCCFs decision FWe need to t ake a quick breath before plunging into the next round of spectrum bidding so tha t carriers can assess their spectrum needs and develop bidding strategiesF he said But several TV broadcasters and a group representing rural carriers opposed any further delay They said that carriers had had plenty of time to prepa re for the auction and that further delay would be unfair FThere didnFt seem to be any justification for another delayF sai d Nancy Udell vice presidentmedia relations for Paxson Communications Corp the largest incumbent broadcaster in the spectrum to be auctioned But Fsin ce the FCC has spoken weFre ready to participateF in any bandclearing negotiations she added Brent Weingardt an attorney for the Rural Telecommunications Group RTG also criticized the postponement FThereFs little pretense that the Commission only views auctions in terms of how much revenue they can generate and theyFre willing to assist larger companies who are the only ones that are going to be able to compete in that auctionF he said FWe donF t see any other public interest in postponing itF Mr Weingardt said he didnFt expect RTG members to participate in the au ction but said his group opposed a further delay on FprincipleF Analysts Assess Effect Wall Street analysts saw the auction delay as either positive or neutral fo r carriers FThe additional six months until the start of the auction giv es both the FCC and the potential bidders quite a bit of time to ready themselvesF said John M Bensche an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc in a note to investors FBy September the industry will hopefully have appropriately addressed the various issues that remain surrounding the MHz band and the auction can commence without further delayF Michael I Rollins an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney Inc said the delay which he characterized as Fwidely anticipatedF was Fneutra lF for carriers because many had indicated little interest in the MHz auction focusing instead on the C and F block sale Cynthia M Motz an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp echoed th at view She doesnFt expect the bidding for MHz licenses to be nearly as fierce as it was in the C and F block reauction and doubts that large carriers such as Verizon Wireless ATT Wireless Services Inc VoiceStrea m Wireless Corp and Sprint PCS will be very active FThis should hopeful ly make for some attractive pricing for at least some of the licensesF Ms Motz said in a note to investors QUALCOMM Creates

Industry Association which in the past has urg ed the FCC on behalf of small carriers to continue to limit the amount of spectrum wireless carriers may hold in any one market has declared it F will no longer play an active roleF in the issue In a statement released last week PCIA President and Chief Executive Offic er Jay Kitchen said the spectrum cap had been Ftremendously successfulF But F this issue has become moot as new spectrum is now available without restrictions leaving US carriers a clear and open opportunityF to off er G thirdgeneration services he added Mr Kitchen also cited PCIAFs Ffocus on the development of the mobile convergence marketplace on a global levelF as a factor in its decision t o discontinue its Factive role in the spectrum cap issueF Large carriers have urged the

competitive local exchange carriers sparred last week ov er whether the FCC should preempt several Ohio citiesF authority over the placement of telecommunications facilities Their debate centered on one question Does requiring a competitive local exchange carrier CLEC to place its fiber lines underground rather than o n aerial facilities where the incumbentFs facilities are located constitu te F discriminationF under section of the Telecommunications Act of Predictably the two sides split on the issue CLECs said that subjecting them to different requirements from those faced by incumbent local exchange carriers constituted discrimination and created a Fbarrier to market ent ryF by increasing CLECsF costs Section a bars state and local governm ent actions that prevent or have the effect of preventing any entity from providing any interstate or intrastate telecom service Municipalities insisted that directing where telecommunications facilities should be placed was within the

rightsofway or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basisF Both sides presented their views in comments filed last week in Cable Services docket In that proceeding City Signal Communications Inc had asked the FCC to preempt the underground telecom line requirement s of Cleveland Heights Wickliffe and Pepper

requirements that cities manage rightsofways on a F competitively neutral and nondiscriminatoryF basis It said requiring City Signal to place its facilities underground effectively prohibited it from

effective competitionF It offers a list of initiatives that Congress should consider so CLECs can continue fueling economic growth Among the legislative initiatives the association advocat es to address its complaints about ILECs are the following Separate ILECs into wholesale and retail units Allow the FCC to impose steeper penalties for violating procompetitive directives Require that Fall combinations of network elements and full function ality of the loop be provided to competitorsF Extend collocation requirements to include FmultifunctionalF equi pment Affirm the FCCFs pricing methodology for unbundled network elements and Permit interconnection among CLECs collocated in ILEC facilities The ALTS study also targets building owners with whom CLECs have been feuding over the need for mandatory building access It asks Congress to require building owners to Fprovide nondiscriminatory access to their buildings while at the same time protecting the security of the building an d ensuring that competitors pay for the costs of installing equipmentF ALTS also takes aim at municipalities which it says have caused Fexcess ive delayF by not promptly approving applications to use

Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRothFs decision not to seek renomination to a second term on the Commission has touched off a new round of speculation about who the Bush administration will appoint to the Commission and when it will act to fill potential vacancies at the agency Many industry and congressional observers think the White House will act quickly to fill the vacancy that was created by the resignation by former Chairman William E Kennard last month They point to the speed with which President Bush tapped Commissioner Michael K Powell to succeed Mr Kennard as chairman That announcement was made on the first business day after th e inauguration FI think theyFre moving quickly on it and we could see something happen in the next couple of weeksF former FCC Chairman Richard E Wiley told TR during a break at last weekFs Comnet conference see separate story Mr Wiley who played a key role on the Bush administrationFs FCC transi tion advisory team said there might be a sense of urgency at the White House to name at least one GOP Commissioner to give the Republicans a majority on th e Commission There currently are two Democrats on the fiveseat FCC Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani and two Republicans Commissioners FurchtgottRot h and Chairman Powell The Communications Act of as amended prevents any one political party from appointing more than a bare

R Miss lauded his efforts Fto ensure that the FCC was an independen t agency accountable to consumers and not an extension of the executive branchF Court Upholds FCC Rules Giving ILECs Road to Pricing Flexibility A federal appeals court says itFs reasonable to use the number of carrie rs collocating equipment in an incumbentFs wire centers as FproxyF me asures for determining the levels of local competition The FCC uses that proxy to determine whether an incumbent local exchange carrier should be freed from some pricing regulations The US Court of Appeals in Washington last wee k rejected WorldCom IncFs argument that the FCCFs criteria for granti ng ILECs pricing flexibility didnFt measure competition accurately and were unlaw fully arbitrary The case centered on the FCCFs pricingflexibility order in Common Carrier docket The order allowed ILECs regulated under its pricec ap regime to gain greater flexibility in setting rates for interstate services if they met certain competitive FtriggersF TR Aug For example ILECs can win relief from some pricing rules if the FCC finds that unaffiliated carriers have collocated facilities in a certain percenta ge of the ILECFs wire centers and that at least one collocator is facilitiesbased In its Feb ruling in MCI WorldCom Inc et al v FCC case no the court found that the FCC Fmade a reasonable policy determinationF that the number of collocating comptitors was a reasonable proxy for the level o f competition in a particular market Judge David B Sentelle wrote the opinion he was joined by Judge A Raymond Randolph and Chief Judge Harry T Edwards The judges didnFt specifically endorse the use of collocation as a proxy even allowing that Fit may well be that collocation is a poor measure of market shareF But they noted that the FCC had not relied on market sha re as Fthe beall and endallF of competition They agreed with the FCC th at Fthe presence of sunk investment and the resulting potential for entry into the market can limit anticompetitive behavior by LECsF In oral arguments last December the judges expressed frustration bordering on exasperation at WorldComFs inability to present an alternative means of measuring competition TR Dec ATT Corp and Time Warner Telecom Inc also were petitioners in the consolidated case The judges concluded that because they found the FCCFs proxy model F reasonableF there was no basis on which to require the FCC Fto condu ct a more searching analysis of competition before granting pricing flexibility F They cited a case before the circuit court in Washington DC US v FCC FSomeone must decide when enough data is enough In the first instance that decision must be made by the Commission To allow others to force the Commission to conduct further evidentiary inquiry would be to arm intereste d parties with a potent instrument for delayF the judges quoted The judges rejected WorldComFs claim that the pricingflexibility order violated FCC precedent because much of the relief it provided to ILECs was typical of that given to carriers that are regulated as FnondominantF WorldCom argued that the FCC should be precluded from granting such relief without conducting the same kind of competition analysis that it does when determining if a carrier should be considered nondominant The appeals court disagreed saying the pricing flexibility order did not grant LECs Fall the regulatory relief afforded nondominant carriersF It noted that carriers that obtain regulatory relief under the pricingflexibility order still must file tariffs a requirement that is Fnot insignificantF The appeals court also dismissed WorldComFs argument that the FCC was arbitrary and capricious in authorizing regulatory relief by metropolitan statistical area MSA It said the FCC had considered other options when devising its rules and called WorldComFs objections Fat bottom a difference in policy preferences and not a sufficient basis on which to upset the FCCFs determinationF The judges relied on similar reasoning in dismissing WorldComFs objectio ns to the triggers the FCC established The court called these objections Fno more than policy differencesF

Ericsson said Wireless Industry Says Agreement Could Streamline Antenna Siting The FCC the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP and a telecommunications working group that includes historic preservation officers federal officials and industry representatives have formulated a programmatic agreement designed to streamline the review of antenna collocations under the National Historic Preservation Act TR Nov Jan notes and Jan The agreement comes on the heels of the advisory councilFs decision in November to revise rules that the industry maintains make it difficult to site antenna towers The new regulations were adopted after a court challenge alleged voting irregularities in the councilFs adoption o f the original rules which implemented section of the National Historic Preservation Act TR Aug and and Sept Like many industry officials Robert L Hoggarth senior vice presidentgovernment relations for the Personal Communications Industry Association has problems with the ACHPFs rules But he says he hopes t he programmatic agreement on collocationsFand perhaps other issuesFcan h elp speed the antennasiting process Mr Hoggarth discussed the agreement wit h TR An edited excerpt of the conversation follows TR WhatFs your complaint with the process used to adopt the rules that the ACHP approved last November Hoggarth The new rules in our view were originally promulgatedFor at least an attempt was made to promulgate themFback in The current version that the ACHP passed in the fall was essentially the same rules tha t they attempted to adopt in early TR So in your view the rules that were approved last November and took effect in January are pretty much the same as those adopted in Hoggarth The original revisions that took place in early never legal ly went into effect because they were incorrectly promulgated This latest effort on the part of ACHP was an attempt to cure the early illegalities The shortened rulemaking process was in many respects a way to rubbersta mp the original rules While it did provide an opportunity for the industry t o suggest changes not many of those were accepted by the ACHP TR What problems does the wireless industry have with the rules themselve s Hoggarth The key to the wireless industry is speed to market And the latest applications of the advisory council rules by state authorities and by the federal government have created additional potential for real delays fo r the industry in the processing of new antennasite requests TR Why have the rules hurt the antennasiting process Is the wireless industry asking to be treated differently from other industries Hoggarth No WhatFs happened is the new process has upped the ante wi th respect to the level of review by state and local authorities The challen ge that the industry has found is that in implementing those rules many state historic preservation officers and many other stakeholders have used it as an opportunity to almost step in and take an approval role as opposed to an advisory role ItFs the FCC that approves the antenna sites as oppose d to the state historic preservation officers or the ACHP TR So you see the ACHP as trying to have a greater role than itFs allow ed under the law Hoggarth Correct Our goal is to make sure that historic preservation issues are addressed and that theyFre looked at in a responsible way Resources should be devoted to those sites that are going to present real challenges for cultural and historic preservation as opposed to the creati on of an additional bureaucracy that does nothing but cause more pressure and work for state and local authorities significantly increase the processing cost for carriers and tower companies and delay the approval of those facilities TRA telecom working group has drafted a programmatic agreement to streamli ne the antenna collocation process WhatFs the purpose of such an agreemen t Hoggarth The efforts to come up with a collocation agreement as well as previous efforts of the telecommunications working group were attempts to address the overall industry concern about the ACHP rules and processes Our goal was to bite off manageable chunks of the problem so we could resol ve some things in the very short term and provide immediate benefits to the historic preservation community and the industry This is a billiondollar issue overall with respect to compliance speed of service delays and additional obligations both at the state and local levels And collocation is one way to take a significant chunk out of that billiondollar burden Since last summer there have been active negotiatio ns on issues such as delegation and collocation in an effort to resolve some shortterm immediate goals A group within the telecommunications working group established by the ACHP reached consensus on a collocation proposal But what arose in the late fall was significant concern on the ACHPFs si de as to how to implement any agreement reached by the telecommunications working group As a result the ACHP authorized negotiations between the ACHP and the FCC to reach a programmatic agreement with respect to the collocation o f new antenna facilities on existing structures and buildings A general consensus was reached in the fall as to what that would look like The latest efforts with respect to the programmatic agreement focus on th e real desireFon the part of both industry and governmentFto have a spe cific agreement that has some teeth to it that has some consistency to it that everyone can be willing to abide by The negotiations have become very complicated We at PCIA and the tower industry have been working with the ACHP the FCC and the state historic preservation officer community to reach agreements on language that satisfi es the goals of preserving historic properties in a responsible manner TR So the devil is in the details it seems PCIA asked the FCC to amend the draft agreement it sought comment on last month So did the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association Hoggarth Certainly from our industryFs perspective the draft agreemen t that was put on public notice is not our ideal ItFs simply a matter no w of wordsmithing and we want to make sure that the appropriate administrative rules are observed TR Ideally how would a programmatic agreement streamline the collocation process Hoggarth What it would do is allow the industry to put antennas on existi ng facilities without individual review thereby minimizing the impact on the environment by limiting the number of new towers that go up The programmatic agreement will have very specific parameters in which the historic preservation community will be assured that new facilities will go through a process of review ThereFll be assurance that the existing structure on which the collocation is taking place already has undergone a measure of review or that any significant site changes created by collocation will be appropriately reviewed by local authorities TRUnder this streamlined approach what percentage of antennas no longer would have to undergo review by historic preservation officials Hoggarth Our hope is that as a result of the programmatic agreement we would eliminate to of the reviews by state and federal authorities The present system anticipates significant review of literally every new antenna thatFs sited in a community And with collocation thatFs si mply not necessary TR Is there a sense for how many antennas that to represents Hoggarth No itFs hard to say What weFre trying to do is create a system that not only ensures that current sites remain in place and arenFt subj ect to review but also that going forward a large number of new sites will be collocations TR Where has the opposition come from to the collocation agreement Hoggarth The concerns expressed by the historic preservation community center around language that ensures that there are no significant loopholes and we certainly agree with that TR IsnFt it also correct that some historic preservation officers have been concerned that they wonFt have the same review authority on collocations that they currently have Hoggarth I think the concern is a combination of that plus just a lackofcontrol issue which says FMy goodness I donFt have the opp ortunity to review what sort of sites are going to go upF The reality is that the wireless industry is expanding so significantly and so greatly that historic preservation officers simply donFt have the tim e to review every new project They simply donFt need to review every one of them given the lack of ad verse impacts from so many of these collocations TR In addition to collocation what are some of the wireless industryFs other regulatory concerns that are being discussed by the telecom working group Hoggarth They involve such things as the time periods in which reviews ar e required They involve the role of the FCC and the role of the industry in terms of application reviews the use of authorized consultants to conduct the reviews and the role of the ACHP v the role of the state historic preservation officers Literally all aspects of the advisory councilFs rules are touched on TR ACHP officials have said theyFd like to vote at their meeting in Ma rch on a broader programmatic agreement that includes many of these issues in addition to collocation Do you think thatFs still realistic Hoggarth There are various expectations that folks are bringing to the table The reality is that we thought collocation was something that could be resolved in a day time frame and itFs now taken four months And thatF s just one issue that we thought we had broad consensus on within the telecommunications working group As a result itFs just a practical view that a broader programmatic agre ement is going to take a lot of hard work I canFt give you any predictions o n time because if weFre fortunate and if things break the right way we m ight be able to accomplish things sooner rather than later But IFm optimistic ItFs going to take a tremendous amount of work o ver the next year to actually bring something to fruition We continue to work on individual issues with the ACHP WeFve establish ed very positive working relationships with the NCSHPO organization and we ar e building relationships with various tribal representatives as well so that we can really address all aspects of cultural and historical preservation WhatFs Ahead FEBRUARY FThe US Court of Appeals in Washington will hear oral arguments in National Exchange

spectrum It could be that the carrier wanted to ensure dominance in the wireless data market or to guarantee that competitorsF such as Cingular Wireless LLCFdidnFt land the valuable frequencies they t

VoiceStream footprint holes in the Carolinas including Charlotte and Greensboro in North Carolina and Charleston and Columbia in South Carolina analysts said VoiceStream also picked up licenses in Texas the Pacific Northwest and th e Midwest Its auction success combined with its planned merger with Powertel Inc and recent spectrum swap with Cingular has helped it build a nationwide footprint Mr

expect Nextel to continue acquiring MHz and MHz band spectrum and say it also could pursue licenses at the MHz band auction F Whatever the strategy the completion of the auction puts NextelFs competition in a much stronger position to better compete in both the voice and data markets leaving Nextel at a disadvantage for future servicesF Mr Bensche said Meanwhile last week Dana Frix an attorney for San AntonioFbased Allegh eny Communications Inc told TRthat company officials still were considering their options for contesting the auction results Allegheny which dropped out of the reauction before it was over when the prices got too high says the DE rules permitted large carriers to participate through Fshell entitiesF for licenses reserved for entrepreneurs Allegheny failed to persuade the US Court of Appeals in Washington to block the reauction the day before it began in December TR Dec The winning bidders in the reauction have until Feb to submit down payments the FCC said in a public notice released last week The bidders also must submit their FlongformF applications as well as form which includes ownership information by that date The FCC has said it would review ownership arrangements of winning auction bidders closely befo re granting licenses Of the licenses on the block in the reauction were reserved for qualified DEs and were open to all bidders Mr Bensche noted that the liberal capitalization rules for DEs allowed large companies to jump back a nd forth between bidding on FopenF and FclosedF licenses using bi dding credits for the open licenses through the DEs FIn reality this drove up the prices in the closed blocks to the same l evels as the open licenses being chased by the designated entitiesF Mr Bensc he concluded FIn fact analyzing all of the markets in which at the close of the auction one of the open licenses was won by a bidder with bidding credits we come to the conclusion that the closed blocks went for more than the open blocksF Meanwhile last week bankrupt NextWave Telecom Inc whose reclaimed licenses were snatched up at the reauction filed its reply brief with the US Court of Appeals in Washington in its case

Communications from the US Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission regarding Fa telecommunications competition matter in a proce eding which has not been designated for hearing and in which the relevant agency is not a party or commenterF are exempt from the FCCFs rules requiring p arties to report such ex parte communications In December the FCC proposed widening that exemption to include Finternational and foreign government al bodies that exercise similar jurisdiction over relevant mattersF TRDec In a rulemaking notice released in General Counsel docket the FCC cited increased globalization and international mergers as reasons for the proposed rule change The FCC said the rule change would encourage F effective expedited and consistentF communications among antitrust and competition policymakers The Competitive Telecommunications Association said extending the exemption F would impair significantly both the dueprocess rights of parties participating in affected proceedings as well as the FCCFs ability to re nder a decision based on a complete recordF Communications between the FCC and foreign regulators raise different questions from those between the FCC and DoJ or the FTC CompTel said It argued that foreign regulatory bodies Foperate under laws and regulation s that may embody substantially different competition goalsF than the FCC pursues unlike DoJ or the FTC which operate under a Fcomplementary statutory schemeF Many foreign governments maintain interests or have close ties to Fcomme rcial enterprises that may be affected by the FCCFs decisions in merger cases F it continued And Vodafone Group plc through its business unit Vodafone Americas Asia Region Inc said the rationale behind the rule change the FCC cited was insufficient If the FCC wanted to communicate with foreign regulators F on general methods of analysis for example or general approaches to evaluati ng licenses transfersF those communications would not fall under ex parte rules The rulemaking notice Fdoes not explain why in the context of a specific proceeding the ex parte rules hinder exchange of informationF it said Vodafone questioned whether the FCC has authority under the federal Administrative Procedure Act to Fafford foreign government agencies the same treatment as domestic regulatory agenciesF The APAFs Fwhole re cordF and dueprocess safeguards that ensure that parties may comment on the entire record of a proceeding are underlying principles of federal agenciesF ex parte rules Vodafone said The APA makes an Fexpress distinctionF

Mr Weingardt said he didnFt expect RTG members to participate in the au ction but said his group opposed a further delay on FprincipleF Analysts Assess Effect Wall Street analysts saw the auction

John M Bensche an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc in a note to investors FBy September the industry will hopefully have appropriately addressed the various issues that remain surrounding the MHz band and the auction can commence without further delayF Michael I Rollins an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney Inc said the delay which he characterized as Fwidely anticipatedF was Fneutra lF for carriers because many had indicated little interest in the MHz auction focusing instead on the C and F block sale Cynthia M Motz an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp echoed th at view She doesnFt expect the bidding for MHz licenses to be nearly as fierce as it was in the C and F block reauction and doubts that large carriers such as Verizon Wireless ATT Wireless Services Inc VoiceStrea m

one question Does requiring a competitive local exchange carrier CLEC to place its fiber lines underground rather than o n aerial facilities where the incumbentFs facilities are located constitu te F discriminationF under section of the Telecommunications Act of Predictably the two sides split on the issue CLECs said that subjecting them to different requirements from those faced by incumbent local exchange carriers constituted discrimination and created a Fbarrier to market ent ryF by increasing CLECsF costs Section a bars state and local governm ent actions that prevent or have the effect of preventing any entity from providing any interstate or intrastate telecom service Municipalities insisted that directing where telecommunications facilities should be placed was within the

rightsofway or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basisF Both sides presented their views in comments filed last week in Cable Services docket In that proceeding City Signal Communications Inc had asked the FCC to preempt the underground telecom line requirement s of Cleveland Heights Wickliffe and Pepper

requirements that cities manage rightsofways on a F competitively neutral and nondiscriminatoryF basis It said requiring City Signal to place its facilities underground effectively prohibited it from

competition The FCC uses that proxy to determine whether an incumbent local exchange carrier should be freed from some pricing regulations The US Court of Appeals in Washington last wee k rejected WorldCom IncFs argument that the FCCFs criteria for granti ng ILECs pricing flexibility didnFt measure competition accurately and were unlaw fully arbitrary The case centered on the FCCFs pricingflexibility order in Common Carrier docket The order allowed ILECs regulated under its pricec ap regime to gain greater flexibility in setting rates for interstate services if they met certain competitive FtriggersF TR Aug For example ILECs can win relief from some pricing rules if the FCC finds that unaffiliated carriers have collocated facilities in a certain percenta ge of the ILECFs wire centers and that at least one collocator is facilitiesbased In its Feb ruling in MCI WorldCom Inc et al v FCC case no the court found that the FCC Fmade a reasonable policy determinationF that the number of collocating comptitors was a reasonable proxy for the level o f competition in a particular market Judge David B Sentelle wrote the opinion he was joined by Judge A Raymond Randolph and Chief Judge Harry T Edwards The judges didnFt specifically endorse the use of collocation as a proxy even allowing that Fit may well be that collocation is a poor measure of market shareF But they noted that the FCC had not relied on market sha re as Fthe beall and endallF of competition They agreed with the FCC th at Fthe presence of sunk investment and the resulting potential for entry into the market can limit anticompetitive behavior by LECsF In oral arguments last December the judges expressed frustration bordering on exasperation at WorldComFs inability to present an alternative means of measuring competition TR Dec ATT Corp and Time Warner Telecom Inc also were petitioners in the consolidated case The judges concluded that because they found the FCCFs proxy model F reasonableF there was no basis on which to require the FCC Fto condu ct a more searching analysis of competition before granting pricing flexibility F They cited a case before the circuit court in Washington DC US v FCC FSomeone must decide when enough data is enough In the first instance that decision must be made by the Commission To allow others to force the Commission to conduct further evidentiary inquiry would be to arm intereste d parties with a potent instrument for delayF the judges quoted The judges rejected WorldComFs claim that the pricingflexibility order violated FCC precedent because much of the relief it provided to ILECs was typical of that given to carriers that are regulated as FnondominantF WorldCom argued that the FCC should be precluded from granting such relief without conducting the same kind of competition analysis that it does when determining if a carrier should be considered nondominant The appeals court disagreed saying the pricing flexibility order did not grant LECs Fall the regulatory relief afforded nondominant carriersF It noted that carriers that obtain regulatory relief under the pricingflexibility order still must file tariffs a requirement that is Fnot insignificantF The appeals court also dismissed WorldComFs argument that the FCC was arbitrary and capricious in authorizing regulatory relief by metropolitan statistical area MSA It said the FCC had considered other options when devising its rules and called WorldComFs objections Fat bottom a difference in policy preferences and not a sufficient basis on which to upset the FCCFs determinationF The judges relied on similar reasoning in dismissing WorldComFs objectio ns to the triggers the FCC established The court called these objections Fno more than policy differencesF

Ericsson said Wireless Industry Says Agreement Could Streamline Antenna Siting The FCC the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP and a telecommunications working group that includes historic preservation officers federal officials and industry representatives have formulated a programmatic agreement designed to streamline the review of antenna collocations under the National Historic Preservation Act TR Nov Jan notes and Jan The agreement comes on the heels of the advisory councilFs decision in November to revise rules that the industry maintains make it difficult to site antenna towers The new regulations were adopted after a court challenge alleged voting irregularities in the councilFs adoption o f the original rules which implemented section of the National Historic Preservation Act TR Aug and and Sept Like many industry officials Robert L Hoggarth senior vice presidentgovernment relations for the Personal Communications Industry Association has problems with the ACHPFs rules But he says he hopes t he programmatic agreement on collocationsFand perhaps other issuesFcan h elp speed the antennasiting process Mr Hoggarth discussed the agreement wit h TR An edited excerpt of the conversation follows TR WhatFs your complaint with the process used to adopt the rules that the ACHP approved last November Hoggarth The new rules in our view were originally promulgatedFor at least an attempt was made to promulgate themFback in The current version that the ACHP passed in the fall was essentially the same rules tha t they attempted to adopt in early TR So in your view the rules that were approved last November and took effect in January are pretty much the same as those adopted in Hoggarth The original revisions that took place in early never legal ly went into effect because they were incorrectly promulgated This latest effort on the part of ACHP was an attempt to cure the early illegalities The shortened rulemaking process was in many respects a way to rubbersta mp the original rules While it did provide an opportunity for the industry t o suggest changes not many of those were accepted by the ACHP TR What problems does the wireless industry have with the rules themselve s Hoggarth The key to the wireless industry is speed to market And the latest applications of the advisory council rules by state authorities and by the federal government have created additional potential for real delays fo r the industry in the processing of new antennasite requests TR Why have the rules hurt the antennasiting process Is the wireless industry asking to be treated differently from other industries Hoggarth No WhatFs happened is the new process has upped the ante wi th respect to the level of review by state and local authorities The challen ge that the industry has found is that in implementing those rules many state historic preservation officers and many other stakeholders have used it as an opportunity to almost step in and take an approval role as opposed to an advisory role ItFs the FCC that approves the antenna sites as oppose d to the state historic preservation officers or the ACHP TR So you see the ACHP as trying to have a greater role than itFs allow ed under the law Hoggarth Correct Our goal is to make sure that historic preservation issues are addressed and that theyFre looked at in a responsible way Resources should be devoted to those sites that are going to present real challenges for cultural and historic preservation as opposed to the creati on of an additional bureaucracy that does nothing but cause more pressure and work for state and local authorities significantly increase the processing cost for carriers and tower companies and delay the approval of those facilities TRA telecom working group has drafted a programmatic agreement to streamli ne the antenna collocation process WhatFs the purpose of such an agreemen t Hoggarth The efforts to come up with a collocation agreement as well as previous efforts of the telecommunications working group were attempts to address the overall industry concern about the ACHP rules and processes Our goal was to bite off manageable chunks of the problem so we could resol ve some things in the very short term and provide immediate benefits to the historic preservation community and the industry This is a billiondollar issue overall with respect to compliance speed of service delays and additional obligations both at the state and local levels And collocation is one way to take a significant chunk out of that billiondollar burden Since last summer there have been active negotiatio ns on issues such as delegation and collocation in an effort to resolve some shortterm immediate goals A group within the telecommunications working group established by the ACHP reached consensus on a collocation proposal But what arose in the late fall was significant concern on the ACHPFs si de as to how to implement any agreement reached by the telecommunications working group As a result the ACHP authorized negotiations between the ACHP and the FCC to reach a programmatic agreement with respect to the collocation o f new antenna facilities on existing structures and buildings A general consensus was reached in the fall as to what that would look like The latest efforts with respect to the programmatic agreement focus on th e real desireFon the part of both industry and governmentFto have a spe cific agreement that has some teeth to it that has some consistency to it that everyone can be willing to abide by The negotiations have become very complicated We at PCIA and the tower industry have been working with the ACHP the FCC and the state historic preservation officer community to reach agreements on language that satisfi es the goals of preserving historic properties in a responsible manner TR So the devil is in the details it seems PCIA asked the FCC to amend the draft agreement it sought comment on last month So did the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association Hoggarth Certainly from our industryFs perspective the draft agreemen t that was put on public notice is not our ideal ItFs simply a matter no w of wordsmithing and we want to make sure that the appropriate administrative rules are observed TR Ideally how would a programmatic agreement streamline the collocation process Hoggarth What it would do is allow the industry to put antennas on existi ng facilities without individual review thereby minimizing the impact on the environment by limiting the number of new towers that go up The programmatic agreement will have very specific parameters in which the historic preservation community will be assured that new facilities will go through a process of review ThereFll be assurance that the existing structure on which the collocation is taking place already has undergone a measure of review or that any significant site changes created by collocation will be appropriately reviewed by local authorities TRUnder this streamlined approach what percentage of antennas no longer would have to undergo review by historic preservation officials Hoggarth Our hope is that as a result of the programmatic agreement we would eliminate to of the reviews by state and federal authorities The present system anticipates significant review of literally every new antenna thatFs sited in a community And with collocation thatFs si mply not necessary TR Is there a sense for how many antennas that to represents Hoggarth No itFs hard to say What weFre trying to do is create a system that not only ensures that current sites remain in place and arenFt subj ect to review but also that going forward a large number of new sites will be collocations TR Where has the opposition come from to the collocation agreement Hoggarth The concerns expressed by the historic preservation community center around language that ensures that there are no significant loopholes and we certainly agree with that TR IsnFt it also correct that some historic preservation officers have been concerned that they wonFt have the same review authority on collocations that they currently have Hoggarth I think the concern is a combination of that plus just a lackofcontrol issue which says FMy goodness I donFt have the opp ortunity to review what sort of sites are going to go upF The reality is that the wireless industry is expanding so significantly and so greatly that historic preservation officers simply donFt have the tim e to review every new project They simply donFt need to review every one of them given the lack of ad verse impacts from so many of these collocations TR In addition to collocation what are some of the wireless industryFs other regulatory concerns that are being discussed by the telecom working group Hoggarth They involve such things as the time periods in which reviews ar e required They involve the role of the FCC and the role of the industry in terms of application reviews the use of authorized consultants to conduct the reviews and the role of the ACHP v the role of the state historic preservation officers Literally all aspects of the advisory councilFs rules are touched on TR ACHP officials have said theyFd like to vote at their meeting in Ma rch on a broader programmatic agreement that includes many of these issues in addition to collocation Do you think thatFs still realistic Hoggarth There are various expectations that folks are bringing to the table The reality is that we thought collocation was something that could be resolved in a day time frame and itFs now taken four months And thatF s just one issue that we thought we had broad consensus on within the telecommunications working group As a result itFs just a practical view that a broader programmatic agre ement is going to take a lot of hard work I canFt give you any predictions o n time because if weFre fortunate and if things break the right way we m ight be able to accomplish things sooner rather than later But IFm optimistic ItFs going to take a tremendous amount of work o ver the next year to actually bring something to fruition We continue to work on individual issues with the ACHP WeFve establish ed very positive working relationships with the NCSHPO organization and we ar e building relationships with various tribal representatives as well so that we can really address all aspects of cultural and historical preservation WhatFs Ahead FEBRUARY FThe US Court of Appeals in Washington will hear oral arguments in National Exchange

Business Executive Briefings FCC Expands ILEC LineSharing Mandates To Fiber Loops Confirms LineSplitting Duty The FCC has given data CLECs competitive local exchange carriers a major win by expanding incumbent local exchange carriersF FlinesharingF and F linesplittingF duties The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in Common Carrier dockets and The order addressed petitions for reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing TR Nov Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs allow competitors to offer highspeed service over the highfrequen cy portion of a loop while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the lowfrequency portion In the order adopted Jan the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing over the entire loop even if theyFve deployed fiber in the loop to suppl ement or replace the original copper line The order was one of many actions tha t the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E KennardFs tenure but that were not immediately available eventually trickling out of the Commission last week Rhythms NetConnections Inc had filed a petition for clarification with t he FCC complaining that some ILECs were contending they didnFt have to unb undle fiber portions of the loop when those portions were used to provide xDSL digital subscriber line services FIn the absence of this clarification a competitive LEC might undertake to collocate a DSLAM digital subscriber line access multiplexer in an incumbentFs central office to provide lineshared xDSL services to custo mers only to be told by the incumbent that it was migrating those customers to fiberfed facilitiesF the FCC said In that case the CLEC would have to collocate another DSLAM in a remote terminal to continue offering lineshar ed services to the same customers FAll indications are that fiber deployment by incumbent LECs is increasi ng and that collocation by competitive LECs at remote terminals is likely to b e costly timeconsuming and often unavailableF the FCC said The FCC says ILECs must allow for Fline splittingF so competitors th at offer voice service using the unbundled network element platform can provideFo r partner with another data CLEC to provideFDSL service on those same line s FIncumbent LECs are required to make all necessary network modifications to facilitate line splitting including providing nondiscriminatory access to operation support systems necessary for preordering ordering provisioning maintenance and repair and billing for loops used in linesplitting arrangementsF the FCC said The FCC Fstrongly urgedF ILECs and CLECs to Fwork together to deve lop processes and systems to support competing carriersF ordering and provisioning of unbundled loops and switching necessary for line splitting F The FCC however denied a related petition for clarification filed by ATT Corp It had asked the FCC to require ILECs to make their xDSL services available to customers even if they obtain voice service from competing carriers using the ILECsF lines ATT was worried that customers wouldn Ft switch their voice service to a competitor if that change would eliminate their ability to get DSL services FAlthough the linesharing order obligates incumbent LECs to make the highfrequency portion of the loop separately available to competing carrie rs on loops where incumbent LECs provide voice service it does not require th at they provide xDSL service when they are no longer the voice providerF t he FCC said FTo the extent that ATT believes that specific incumbent behavior const rains competition in a manner inconsistent with the CommissionFs linesharing rules andor the Communications Act of as amended itself we encourage AT T to pursue enforcement actionF it said The FCC also denied requests from Bell Atlantic Corp now Verizon Communications Inc It had asked the FCC to reconsider the requirement that ILECs refusing to condition a loop for the provision of DS L service demonstrate to the relevant state commission that conditioning that loop would degrade voice services and permit a linesharing deployment schedule other than the one it adopted Rhythms applauded the FCCFs decision FBy expanding the definition o f line sharing to include fiber loops and ensuring our ability to use consumersF existing voice lines for data services we can bring the benefits of the mo st robust broadband service offerings to consumersF said Jeffrey Blumenfel d chief legal officer and general counsel for Rhythms During a press briefing last week see separate story Thomas J Tauke senior vice presidentpublic policy and external affairs at Verizon Communications Inc criticized the FCCFs decision specifically the provisions requiring line splitting The FCC FdidnFt address how thi s is to be doneF he said Jonathan Lee vice presidentregulatory affairs at the Competitive Telecommunications Association said the order was an Funmitigated win F for data CLECs But he said the FCCFs decision not to grant ATTFs petit ion for clarification was FregrettableF Residential consumers who have DSL available only from the ILEC wonFt be able to switch their voice service without losing their DSL service he said M r Lee compared the ILECsF FtyingF of voice and DSL service to Micros oft CorpFs practice of linking its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system The ILEC practice Fcould run afoul of antitrust laws F he said Critics Worry White House FErateF Proposal May Reduce Funding Disco urage Participation The education reform package that President Bush sent to Congress last week is drawing criticism from policymakers who helped draft and implement the F ErateF telecom discount program ItFs also sparking concern among s chools and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it TheyFre worried that the presidentFs Erate proposal if adopted in i ts current FblueprintF form would discourage certain schools from apply ing for discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections In th e long run they fear that the presidentFs proposal would lead to decrease d funding for the program which currently stands at billion a year The main problem these critics say is that shifting administration of the program to the Department of Education as President Bush has said he inten ds to do would render Erate funding dependent on congressional appropriations In its current form under the FCCFs oversight the prog ram is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers The technology part of the presidentFs education reform initiative unvei led last week calls for combining the Erate with several Department of Educati on programs to form one Fperformancebased technology grant programF T hen it says funding for that program would be disbursed Fby formulaF to sta tes through block grants The aim is to streamline the many Fduplicative technology programsF i nto one education grant plan the Bush administration says Such streamlining woul d go a long way toward reducing the Erate programFs Fburdensome paperw orkF requirements and adding more flexibility to those program the proposal say s FFlexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes that include software purchases and development wiring and technology infrastructure and teacher training in the use of technologyF it state s It also would permit Erate recipients to use federal funds to pay for Internet filtering software which is being mandated for the first time thi s year by the ChildrenFs Internet Protection Support Act of TR Jan But key US lawmakers and education officials arenFt prepared to embrac e the plan yet They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on several issues including how the Erate program would be funded and what formula would be used to distribute money among the states Jeff Burnett directorgovernment relations at the National Association of Independent Schools says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service Fund as it is now or by general tax revenues FThatFs a huge quest ion mark and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it wou ld become part of the Department of EducationFs budgetF he says Mr Burnett says making the Erate dependent on general tax revenues could F destabilizeF its funding and discourage some private and parochial schoo ls from applying for telecom discounts FIt would go from where it is now a pretty stable billion per year to where you would have arguments eve ry year in Congress over how much money it would getF Plus he says Erate funds Fno longer would be stringfreeF if they were to be allocated by the federal government Moving the program to the Departme nt of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because of potential Fchurchstate problemsF he says referring to the First Am endment to the US Constitution which prohibits congressional establishment of an official religion And some states may be restricted by their state constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to priva te and religious schools he adds Former FCC Chairman Reed E Hundt who oversaw the implementation of the Erate program back in fears that the end result could be the Fkil ling of the program altogetherF or a Fchopping of it down from a significa nt program to an insignificant oneF Having the Education Department oversee the Erate program would remove stability from the program Mr Hundt stressed FWhere are they going t o find or billion dollars in the general tax revenues to pay for it F he asked FThe bigger telecom service providers probably would be hap py but the support would be reducedF Mr Hundt told TR last week He also rejected the administrationFs claims that consolidating the educ ation technology programs would reduce applicantsF paperwork and filing requirements FMoving it to the Department of Education is not a way to simplify paperworkF Mr Hundt said FNothing is simpler than the wa y itFs done now These forms donFt even go to the government they go to a privately run trust fundF he added A source who works with schools on finetuning their Erate applications foresees a Ffood fight at the state levelF if the Bush administration institutes a blockgrant program FThere wonFt be the same spirit of cooperation among the schools and libraries that there is todayF the so urce says FInstead theyFll see each other as competitionF A library official said that even if the Erate program remained part of th e USF expanding its scope to include software purchases and teacher training could give telecom carriers grounds for a legal challenge of the assessment s made on their revenues FIf the money is to come from the service provi der then the program must directly relate back to the services that they provide I could see someone challenging the software and teachertraining aspectsF the source says Snowe Rockefeller Are Skeptical The program has received an icy response from two US senators who were among the original sponsors of the legislation that added the Erate provisions to the Telecommunications Act of Republican Olympia J Snowe Maine and Democrat John D Rockefeller IV WVa In a statement issued soon after the Bush education proposal was released Jan Sen Rockefeller vowed to Faggressively fightF the Erate as pects of the proposal It would be a Fgrave mistakeF to fold the Erate into a block grant program with the Education Department technology programs Sen Rockefeller said FUnder the Bush blockgrant approach local schools would have less flexibility not moreF Sen Rockefeller said FPrivate and parochia l schools would have to negotiate with state education agencies and worry abo ut entanglements of federal regulations Most importantly the secure funding for the Erate and investments in technology would be jeopardizedF he s aid Sen Snowe also worries about turning the Erate into a blockgrant program Among other things she says such a proposal could deter private and parochial schools from participating in the program FWe plan to work with President Bush and our colleagues in the Congress to ensure that the current program is protected as we donFt support any ef forts that would undermine its goalsF a Snowe aide told TR New House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Fred Upton R Mich h as told President Bush in a letter that he plans to hold several hearings this year on Faspects of your proposal that fall under the subcommitteeFs jurisdictionF including the Erate plan Rep Upton has asked the Bush administration to focus on broadband service deployment Fparticularly as it relates to how increased access to high speed data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve educational opportunitiesF Numerous calls to the White House seeking comment weren Ft returned before TRFs Friday afternoon news deadline FCC Gears Up To Enforce Erate FNetFilter Mandate The FCC wants advice on how to implement the ChildrenFs Internet Protect ion Act of CIPA which requires schools and libraries that receive F ErateF discounts for Internet services and internal connections to use F filteringF technology that prevents minors from accessing FharmfulF material over the FNet The FCC has suggested that recipients certify compliance with the CIPA on forms they must file when applying for Erate discounts on telecom services Internet services and internal connections Under the CIPA the FInternet safety technologyF must filter out F visual depictionsF of FobsceneF material or Fchild pornographyF ev en when adults are using the computers Schools and libraries are required to bar access to visual depictions that are Fharmful to minorsF only when minors are u sing the computers The law requires Erate recipients to certify each program year that they a re complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of the filtering technology while the computers are in use The law allows an administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is bei ng used by an adult Ffor bona fide research or other lawful purposeF Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy in the first year after the effective date of the law they either must

auction of licenses for the megahertz band citing a host of familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the frequencies But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin t he auction March as scheduled noting that the sale already has been postponed three times They say that large carriers have had plenty of tim e to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in respon se to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September TR Jan

bandclearing agreements as evidence to support their cause see separate story Most of their arguments echoed those of Verizon Wireless TV broadcasters donFt have to evacuate the spectrum channels F as part of the transition to digital TV until at the earliest But wireless carriers citing the uncertainty about when the frequencies slated to be auctioned will be available for use have asked the FCC

specious at best F FCC Takes Additional Steps To Help Clear MHz Band The FCC has taken additional steps to help spur the relocation of incumbent TV broadcasters from the megahertz band in order to make way for wirele ss carriers But it said it wouldnFt force the incumbents to clear the frequenciesFat least not yet In a third report and order released last week the Commission said it had decided to allow the private sector to determine what bandclearing mechanisms best suited the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers Specifically the FCC has decided not to impose costsharing rules cost caps or costrecovery guidelines at this time on the relocation of incumbe nt broadcasters Last year the agency asked whether it should impose such rul es TR June and July FSecondary AuctionsF Touted The FCC also will leave it up to industry to decide if Fsecondary auctio nsF should be organized to facilitate bandclearing agreements before the auction which is scheduled to begin March The FCC earlier asked for comments on whether it had the authority to conduct such auctions In the order released last week the FCC reiterated its view of the benefit s of such auctions saying they Fhave potential to offer both broadcasters and new entrants additional opportunities to reduce the potential transaction costs of negotiating with each other directly after the auctionF As part of their transition to digital TV DTV broadcasters donFt have to leave the MHz band channels F until at the earliest The y may stay longer if less than of households in their markets have access to DTV signals That timetable has created uncertainty among wireless carrier s about how much to bidFor whether to bid at allFon the spectrum when i t is auctioned Wireless carriers have asked the FCC to force TV broadcasters out of the spectrum before they are required to leave TR Aug For their part broadcasters have fought such bandclearing mandates and instead have urged the FCC to address larger issues related to the DTV transition especially digital FmustcarryF cable TV rights The FCC recently took several actions that it said would facilitate broadcastersF transition to DTV including those dealing with mustcarry rights In its MHz band order the FCC said it wanted to give voluntary mechanisms a chance in clearing the frequencies for wireless services F We believe that voluntary agreements between broadcasters and licensees should result in the effective clearing of the MHz bandF it said FHow ever we will revisit this issue in the future if we find it necessaryF The FCCFs latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory treatment of private bandclearing agreements For example the agency extended to threeway agreements a general F rebuttable presumptionF adopted last year for bilateral pacts The presumption is that such agreements are in the public interest The FCC also provided guidance on interference issues arising from relocati on agreements that involve moving a broadcaster to a channel below channel And it has streamlined the review of bandclearing agreements and affirmed that it expeditiously will process bandclearing agreements It also clarified that voluntary agreements to temporarily relocate licensees into channels F would be permitted Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the report and order In a statement she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable presumption to threeway agreements She expressed concern that such agreements would result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she wanted to consider bandclearing agreements case by case FAs I have stated previously my ultimate concern is that the presumptio n in favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value o f free overtheair television servicesF Commissioner Tristani said She also took exception with the FCCFs statement that it might revisit i ssues surrounding the mandatory relocation of broadcasters FI remain convinc ed that such action would contravene the statuteF establishing broadcasters F DTV transition she said The FCCFs order was adopted Jan in Wireless Telecommunications docke t Cable Services docket and Mass Media docket A news release on the action and the text of the document were released Jan Kennard Requests Hard Stand In a related development former FCC Chairman William E Kennard has asked Congress to take a hard stand against broadcasters in their transition to DTV Writing Jan to Sen Ernest F Hollings D SC Mr Kennard suggested that Congress set a firm deadline of Dec for TV broadcasters in channels F to relocate He also proposed that broadcasters using channels F after that date b e charged an escalating fee to encourage them to clear the spectrum Writing Jan to Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John McCain R Ariz Lyle Gallagher president of the Association of PublicSafety Communications OfficialsInternational expressed support for Mr KennardFs proposals to help clear the MHz band At the very least steps should be taken to clear channels F Mr Gallagher said Public safety agencies urgently need access to MHz of spectrum in the MHz band that the FCC has reallocated for their use he said but much of it is occupied by broadcasters FBy making the Dec date firm for channels F state and local governments throughout the nation could plan on spectrum being available no later than Jan and could proceed with necessary funding frequenc y planning design and

Telecommunications Internet Association President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas E Wheeler A scarcity in frequencies is hurting US carriersF competitiveness with their foreign counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet he said Mr Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier ma y hold in any one market while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate frequencies for thirdgeneration G services proceeded Such a move woul d ease the spectrum crunch he reasoned At a briefing for reporters last week he said the Bush administration had its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable band s for G use US Seen Falling Behind FGod bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy r eview process but it couldnFt bring it to fruition and it now falls to the Bush administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisionsF Mr Wheeler said FThose decisions will probably take time We canFt afford time It Fs what we donFt have Japan and Europe are already building the networks whil e weF re still trying to figure out where we should get itF he added ThenPresident Clinton launched the G initiative by executive memorandum i n October TR Oct Nov and Nov and Jan and The memorandum calls for the FCC to license the spectrum by Sept after a collaborative effort led by the FCC and the Commerce DepartmentF s National Telecommunications Information Administration But a key obstacle is that the bands being examined most closely for G applications already are occupied by military commercial and educational users Mr Wheeler said that the time it would take to allocate G spectrum made i t even more important for the FCC to lift the spectrum cap immediately The FCC asked for comments on the issue last week see separate story He said he had Fsome very profitable discussionsF with Bush transitio n team officials on spectrum issues although he wouldnFt elaborate He also s aid he was pleased that Donald L Evans stressed the importance of allocating G spectrum in his Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of commerce earli er this month TR Jan Mr Wheeler said another key issue for the coming year was finding ways to use wireless technologies to bridge the Fdigital divideF He stresse d that the gap wouldnFt Fbe bridged by just pumping more money into existing subsidy programsF although he said changes in the universal service program wer e needed On other issues Mr Wheeler said CTIA also hoped there would be congressional or FCC action on Internet privacy

whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum wireless carriers may hold in any one market The Commission also is considering whether it should eliminate its cellular crossinterest rule In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week the FCC asked for comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained modified or eliminated to comply with the publicinterest standard set forth in section of the Communications Act as amended Specifically the agency is soliciting views on whether Fmeaningful econ omic competitionF in the commercial mobile radio service CMRS market has rendered spectrum aggregation limits including the cellular crossinterest rule unnecessary Under the agencyFs rules carriers arenFt allowed to hold more than megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and MHz in rural markets The cellular crossinterest rule restricts an entityFs ownership interest in cellular carriers operating in the same market The FCC wants to know whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the mark et The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes Fmeaningful economic competitionF under section and how competitive conditions ha ve changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in In the largest metropolitan areas where seven in Americans live at lea st five mobile telephone carriers are offering service the agency noted last week As a result it said prices are declining coverage areas are expanding and new service packages are being offered It wants to know if there are publicinterest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of suc h competitive developments Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap saying it has thwarted the US wireless industryFs deployment of thirdgeneration G services placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors Some smaller carriers however have asked the FCC to retain the cap saying it Fs needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger counterparts In a broad review of the cap conducted in the FCC decided to retain t he restriction although it eased the limit in rural markets TR Sept At the time it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against excessive concentration in the CMRS market preserving competition and the consumer benefits it had produced It also determined in that the cellular crossinterest restriction was necessary to protect competition The agency eased the rules somewhat however permitting some degree of crossinterest In November the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its biennial review TR Nov The notice of proposed rulemaking adopted Jan and released Jan in Wireless Telecommunications docket stems from that review Comments are due days after the notice Fs publication in the Federal Register and replies are due days after that In a separate statement Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth said that h e supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have conclude d that the cap should be lifted FThe use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues to search for a corresponding competitive illF he said FI have grown impatient with the CommissionFs repeated reexaminations of these issues without substantial alterations in our policy approachF Industry Praises Review Thomas E Wheeler president and chief executive officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association said that lifting the cap was crucial while a highlevel effort to identify and allocate G bands winds through the regulatory process see separate story Mr Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to additional spectrum was necessary for the US to maintain its leadership i n the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencie s for G services setting aside twice as much spectrum as the US has he said The Personal Communications Industry Association however has said the cap is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market Mr Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K Powell had said he would favor lifting the spectrum cap FClearly in some of the opinions that heFs written in the spectrum proceeding heFs asked the question Why should this continueF Mr Wheeler said FWeFre hopefulF ThenCommissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November but said he tended to agree with Commissioner FurchtgottRothFs conclusion that the cap F has outlived its usefulnessF Notice Explores Alternatives In its rulemaking notice the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched For example it asks whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services It also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are offering service The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat alreadylicensed spectru m differently from frequencies licensed in the future FAs a general matt er we believe that newly available CMRSsuitable spectrum either should be excluded from the spectrum cap or if it is included that the cap should be adjusted accordinglyF the Commission said The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would affect its authority to review licensetransfer requests under section d of the Act If it makes such changes to the cap it wants to know whether it could or should Fincorporate other methodsF into its licensetransfer review to prevent consolidations Fthat would eliminate the benefits brought by competitionF It also seeks comments on whether removing the cap would place more of a burden on the FCC and industry in the review of license transfers If the Commission decides to keep the spectrum cap for now it wants to kno w what further market developments could make the cap unnecessary and whether it should set a FsunsetF date for the restrictions Regarding the cellular crossinterest rule the FCC asked whether the restriction was still necessary to prevent cellular carriers from merging i n markets where there is little or no other competition Bookham Technology plc

Division of Public Utilities The staff said Rep Ure pulled those drafts after deciding that the state Fs regulatory structure shouldnFt be altered in the midst of the current en ergy crisis The Division of Public Utilities is charged with representing the public interest before the PSC and ensuring that all utility customers have access to safe reliable service at reasonable prices The Committee of Consumer Services represents residential small business and agricultural consumer s before the PSC Some parties had expressed concern that merging the two entities would decrease the

unconvinced by the arguments of ATT and WorldCom Inc which had challeng ed the order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for so me services In the forbearance order the FCC stated that it granted the relief request ed Fto the extent that the pricing flexibility order establishes a framewor k pursuant to which Bell operating company petitioners may obtain relief by

and it was categorically deniedF The FCC simply F remindedF U S WEST that it was eligible to apply for pricing flexibility under the regime for reviewing such requests the court said The court added however that the FCC couldnFt use its pricing flexibil ity rules as a substitute for its statutory mandate to consider requests for forbearance FCongress has established section as a viable and

offer interLATA local access and transport area services in Kansas and Oklahoma could offer insights to other Bell companies planning their own interLATA service bidsFespecially for rural states In granting SWBTFs applica tion the FCC marked some clear guideposts it will use for evaluating future bids including issues relating to latefiled data and other procedural matters In an order adopted unanimously Jan and released Jan in Common Carrier docket the FCC doubled the number of states in which Bell companies are permitted to provide inregion interLATA services In an unprecedented move the FCC delayed the effectiveness of its decision for days Under section of the Telecommunications Act of the FCC must determine that a Bell company has met a point FchecklistF of marketopening mandates in a given state before authorizing it to provide interLATA services there The FCC must consult with the US Department of Justice and the relevant state commission before granting such an applicati on The FCC said it imposed the day delay because it had based its approval in part on UNE unbundled network element rates that SWBT changed after submitting its application Competitors had argued that the new rates shouldnFt be considered when evaluating SWBTFs application At the t ime the FCC said it wasnFt sure Fwhat reliance if anyF it would place on the new rates In a Jan statement thenFCC Chairman William E Kennard said the original rates were Fnot acceptableF and praised SWBT for voluntarily reducing them But it may not be so easy in the future for Bell companies to amend their interLATA service applications In last weekFs order the F CC said Fit would be rare for other parties to meet the high bar for accep ting the latefiled rates set here in other applicationsF ThenCommissioner Michael K Powell objected to the day delay and cautioned that Bell companies Frisk rejection if they file evidence afte r the due date for initial commentsF Mr Kennard said the FCC Fmust ensur e that a pattern of lastminute rate reductions or other changes in section applications does not develop in the futureF In justifying the inclusion of the new rates in its consideration of SWBT Fs application the FCC cited its authority to waive its own procedural rules in cases where doing so will serve the public interest It said that Fa nu mber of circumstancesF supported its waiver of the FcompleteasfiledF doctrine including the fact that the rate changes Fwere limited in natureF The FCC indicated it wouldnFt accept certain other types of data filed a fter Bell companies submit interLATA service applications such as Fmore comp lex rate revisionsF It also indicated that it wouldnFt consider latefi led F measures designed to achieve nondiscriminatory performance in the applicant Fs provision of service to competitive local exchange carriers since it is difficult to determine the actual effect of such changes on performance in advanceF The FCCFs KansasOklahoma order

approval as a boon for Bells in other states particularly rural ones FWhile these markets are relativ ely small Oklahoma at million and Kansas at million their approval signals a positive trend for future approval particularly with the appointment of Michael Powell as the new FCC chairmanF said USB Warburg LLC The FCCFs action represents the first successful multistate application Fand the first time a single Bell company has gained FCC approval in more than o ne state in its service territory SBC last summer gained FCC approval to off er interLATA services in Texas TR July Evidence from Other States Accepted The FCC also offered clues about how it would view future applications that rely on a Bell companyFs performance in one state to show its compliance with the section mandates in another state There were no independent thirdparty tests of SWBTFs operation support systems OSSs in Kansas a nd Oklahoma but the company did provide thirdparty verification that those systems were the same as the OSSs used in Texas The FCC said that such an approach was appropriate given that the Texas proceeding served as Fa precursor and a modelF for the proceedings in Kansas and Oklahoma The FCC also was clear about the types of issues it would recognize in opponentsF filings on future interLATA applications It noted that the statutory day review period was designed as a Ffasttrack narrowly focused adjudicationF process It said that such proceedings are F inappropriate forums for the consideration of industrywide local competiti on questions of general applicabilityF If SWBT fails to continue to comply with any of the requirements under section the FCC can hold the telco liable for up to million annual ly in Kansas and million annually in Oklahoma SWBT must meet a series of antiFbackslidingF and performancemeasurement requirements or it cou ld face fines or other legal action the FCC said International Service OKs Granted The Telecommunications Division of the FCCFs

reexamining its policy limiting how requesting carriers can use enhanced extended links EELsF combinations of unbundled loops and transport purchased from incumbent loca l exchange carriers The FCC previously ruled that requesting carriers can Ft use EELs to provide exchange access services exclusively The FCC had imposed that prohibition in response to incumbent local exchang e carriersF fears that competitors could use EELS to avoid paying special access charges TR Sept The Commission later extended the prohibition and promised to revisit the issue early this year TR June In a Jan public notice seeking comments on the issue Common Carrier docket the FCC asked if the exchange access and local exchange markets were Fso interrelated from an economic and technological perspec tive that a finding that a network element meets the FimpairF standard und er section d of the Telecommunications Act of for the local exchange market would itself entitle competitors to use that network elemen t solely or primarily in the exchange access marketF The FimpairF standard requires the FCC to evaluate whether the failur e to unbundle each network element would impair competitorsF ability to provi de service The FCC asked whether the local exchange and exchange access markets are F economically and technically distinctF If the markets are distinct do es lack of access to looptransport combinations impair requesting carriersF ability to provide special access services the FCC asked It asked about the availability of Falternative elementsF aside from those offered by the incumbents It asked whether it should treat special access and private line services as a single market The FCC also sought comment on the nature of the special access and private line markets for business and residential endusers FIn some markets particularly those markets serving highvolume business customers it may b e practical and economical for carriers to compete using selfprovisioned facilitiesF the FCC said But in residential and smallbusiness market s F the delay and cost associated with selfprovisioning will preclude carriers from serving that market without access to unbundled network elementsF The FCC also asked whether requesting carriers should be permitted to combi ne unbundled network elements with tariffed access services purchased from incumbents That kind of commingling is now prohibited by FCC rules FSpecifically if a requesting carrier converts special access circuits to combinations of unbundled network elements we ask parties to comment on whether such circuits may remain connected to any existing access service circuits without regard to the nature of the traffic carried over the acces s circuitsF it said Comments on the public notice are due days after its publication in the Federal Register replies are due days after publication Pole Attachment TELRIC Rates To Be Challenged in High Court The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases involving lengthy disputes over FCC rules One case stems from a challenge of the FCCFs methodology for setting rates for interconnection and unbundled network elements UNEs In a separate case the court will consider whether the agency has authority to regulate the rates utility companies charge wireles s and cable TV service providers for attaching equipment to their utility pol es Oral arguments in the cases havenFt been scheduled yet As she has done in a number of other telecomrelated cases Justice Sandra Day OFConnor recus ed herself from the courtFs deliberations In the first case a federal appeals court had overturned the FCCFs use of TELRIC totalelement longrun incremental cost pricing rules for setting rates for interconnection and UNEs TR July The high court said it would focus on the following questions Whether the TELRIC methodology is unlawful under section d of th e Telecommunications Act of Whether the Act or the Ftakings clauseF of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution requires incorporation of an incumbent local exchange carrier Fs ILECFs historical costs in its UNE rates and Whether section c of the Act prohibits regulators from requirin g that ILECs combine certain previously uncombined network elements at the request of a new market entrant The consolidated cases beginning with Verizon Communications Inc v FCC et alno came from the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit St Louis In what many incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs considered a victory the Eighth Circuit last year overturned the FCCFs TELRIC pricing rules But the court didnFt go so far as to agree with I LECs that rates for interconnection and UNEs must be based on historic costs In the second case the Supreme Court will consider whether the Fpole attachmentF provisions of the Communications Act of as amended ap ply to cable TV facilities that also are used to provide highspeed Internet access and to equipment used to provide wireless services The US Court of Appeals for the th Circuit Atlanta had held that the FCC didnFt have authority to regulate the rates utilities can charge for facilities that Internet or wireless service providers attach to their

antenna collocations on historic sites The industry groups say the changes are needed to ensure that the pact accomplishes its goal But a historic preservation group says the agreemen t would result in harm to historic properties The agreement was drafted pursuant to the National Historic Preservation A ct NHPA by the FCC the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation ACHP a nd a telecommunications working group that includes state historic preservatio n officers federal officials and wireless industry representatives TR Nov The FCC said it expected to take action on a final agreement on or about Jan The pact restricts the conditions under which state or tribal historic preservation officers would review antennas for their potential effect on historic properties or sites Wireless industry officials say they hope to of new antenna applications would be freed from the review process CTIA Attacks Agreement As drafted the agreement Fdoes not streamline the regulatory process fo r collocationsF the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Associationsai d in comments filed at the FCC last week Instead it Fthreatens to actually impede collocationF CTIA noted that under current FCC rules licensees are responsible for determining whether an antenna would affect a historic property FHowev er under the proposed national programmatic agreement any person whether qualified or not at any time can allege at the FCC that the proposed collocation has an adverse effect on historic propertiesF prompting a r eview before further construction can proceed CTIA said FSuch a provision undermines the FCCFs efforts to streamline the coll ocation process It also fails to recognize that the effects of collocations on historic properties are categorically minimal and unlikely to raise histor ic preservation issues not already addressed in the proposedF national programmatic agreement CTIA said that only in Fwelldefined and limited circumstancesF such as a substantial increase in the size of an antenna should a collocated facilit y be subject to review Otherwise the burden should be on ACHP and historic preservation officers to prove that an antenna will harm a historic propert y CTIA argued In addition the trade group said the FCC should ensure that future environmental assessments are processed in accordance with the Commission Fs own rules CTIA said decisions by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau F could be interpreted to suggest that licensees take steps required by neith er the CommissionFs rules nor the NHPAF In its comments the Personal Communications Industry Associationsaid that while it strongly supported the aim of the programmatic agreement Fsome necessary amendmentsF would ensure that the pact would Ftruly benefit all parties and advance the common goals of achieving the rapid buildout of th e nationFs indispensable telecommunications network while at the same time protecting the nationFs invaluable historic resourcesF PCIA said the draft agreement on which the FCC sought comments Fpreserve s much of the substanceF of an earlier version of the pact that was approv ed by the telecom working group But provisions added in the latest draft differ from Fthe intent of the partiesF previous agreementsF and Frequ ire clarification correction or modificationF it said Among the amendments PCIA suggested were changing the effective date of the agreement to the date it is published it proposed March unless an earlie r date is possible It also suggested changes in language that it says would limit which entities could mount antennas on towers And it wants to clari fy that compliance with the agreement constitutes compliance with the NHPAF s and the ACHPFs rules The Jefferson County Colo Historical Commissionalso opposed the programmatic agreement but for different reasons It said the pact would weaken the NHPA and the National Environmental Preservation Act It said t he collocation of antennas should not be permitted without environmental assessments The draft agreement Fplaces the wireless industry above the law that pro tects structures and American citizens that use themF the historical commissi on added The Telecommunications Industry Association has published The Telecommunications Industry Association has publishedan interim standar d that defines the messaging required to support Phase II Fenhanced F E systems The standard is called TIAEIAISJSTD Carriers Others See Problems In FCCFs IDNumber Proposal Carriers and broadcasters gave a lukewarm reception to the FCCFs plan to require each regulated entity to use a unique identifying number on certain filings Many carriers and others said the planned system was duplicative of existing registration programs and suggested ways to simplify the FCCFs process for tracking regulatory filings The FCC had proposed making mandatory a previously voluntary system under which anyone doing business with the agency would use a digit FCC registration number FRN obtained from the Commission Registration System In a notice of proposed rulemaking released in Managing Director docket last December the FCC suggested that the FRN be required on all regulatory fee payments waiver petitions auction payments and other filings and submissions TR Dec Parties would be responsible f or maintaining the accuracy of the information in the Commission Registration System database In comments filed on the proposal last week many carriers said they supported the FCCFs goal of efficiently tracking filings and fees but disagreed with just how the plan should be implemented Parties already use a taxpayer identification number TIN on many of their FCC filings including those on which the Commission has suggested using th e FRN Verizon Wireless said FThe need for another Funique identifyin g numberF is unclearF it said The confidentiality of TINs is important Verizon said Fbut this factor does not appear crucial since as the Commission says the information in the Commission Registration System is for Commission use only and will not be published or distributedF Cingular Wireless LLC suggested instead that the FCC do away with its use o f TINs when it institutes the mandatory FRN system It said that financial a nd personal information can be revealed and Fa personFs FidentityF can be F stolenF if his or her TINF is obtained It also criticized the FCC f or the lax security it gave partiesF TINs FInadvertently filed copies cont aining TIN information have been discovered in the CommissionFs public referenc e room on more than one occasionF Cingular said It recommended that the FCC assign FRNs only to parties that request one rather than having the Commission assign FRNs as it issues bills or other notifications The latter approach could Fresult in duplicative FRNs by large business entities who control numerous applicants and licenseesF it added The Walt Disney Co had similar reservations about how the FRNs would be assigned It said that under the voluntary FRN system when a parent compa ny made a joint filing that included regulatory fees for more than one subsidiary only the FRN of the parent company was associated with the payments and the FRNs of the subsidiaries appeared to be unused by the syst em This can lead to the misperception that the subsidiaries still owe the fees Disney said FThe CommissionFs filing systems should be able to prop erly credit payments made on behalf of a licensee that is a subsidiary of anothe r entity regardless of the source of paymentF it added Qwest Communications International Inc criticized the Funforgiving ma nner in which the Commission proposes to implement its FRN proposalF The FC C had suggested that it would reject filings that fail to include an FRN where on e is required which could result in the filingFs dismissal or the FCCF s refusal to accept an application Qwest said such an approach was Foverly harshF and suggested that the FCC F modify its proposed rules to allow filing parties a minimal period of time eg five calendar days to correct a filing or application that lacks an FRNF The National Exchange Carrier Association Inc said that it submits filin gs on behalf of more than carriers and that it was concerned about the F CC suggesting that one entity could obtain multiple FRNs FThe Commission should make clear that as authorized filing agent for its various tariffparticipating members NECA will submit its own FRN with each tariff filing requiring a fee payment but that submission of FRNs for each participating carrier in NECAFs tariff is not necessaryF NECA said If the FCC allows single entities to obtain multiple FRNs Fit should at a minimum establish a system to link related entitiesF NECA said Broadcasters already are required to register separately for four different FCC systems the National Association of Broadcasters said The FCC should F step back and assess its electronic filing and database systems on a holist ic levelF NAB said FAlthough each bureau has developed software progr ams to accommodate their particular needs there is no mechanism by which the systems are crossreferencedF The FCC should explore ways to Fcentr alizeF its identification process NAB concluded Building Owners Carriers Spar over FCC Proposal To Block Service Extend B an on Exclusive Pacts As the FCC considers another slate of proposals designed to help carriers obtain access to multitenant structures building owners and competitive telecom service providers are escalating the battle theyFve been fightin g for the last several years The issue this time around is whether the FCC should take steps specificall y targeting multitenant residential buildings The agency previously has limited the scope of its actions to commercial buildings The FCC recently adopted rules in Wireless Telecommunications docket designed to help competitive local exchange carriers CLECs obtain access to multitenant structures Among other things the Commission barred exclusiv e contracts between telecom service providers and owners of multitenant commercial buildings TR Oct When it adopted those rules the FCC suggested that it would need to take more steps It issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking NPRM askin g whether it should extend its ban on exclusive contracts to apply to multitenant residential buildings and bar incumbent local exchange carriers ILECs from serving buildings where the owner prevents CLEC acces s In its comments filed last week the Real Access Alliance which represents building owners said the FCC already had concluded that it lacked authorit y to Fregulate the real estate industryF But in the further NPRM the FCC asks whether it can Fachieve the same g oal through the draconian measure of ordering telecommunications providers to c ut off service in buildings whose owners do not comply with the CommissionF s wishesF it said FWhether the Commission regulates building owners directlyFas propose d in the original notice of proposed rulemaking in this docketFor indirectly as proposed in the further notice makes no difference because the FCC lacks jurisdiction over buildingaccess agreementsF the alliance said FAgreements for building access are agreements for the use of real estat e and therefore outside the CommissionFs purview even over carriersF it said Enforcement of FBest PracticesF Questioned The Smart Buildings Policy Project which represents telecom carriers and equipment manufacturers that support buildingaccess policies said buildin g owners continue to delay the entry of competitive telecom carriers It advised the FCC not to rely on the model agreements and Fbest practices F promoted by building owners FReasonable access terms and conditions are meaningless if access can be denied entirely or if access can be delayed for months or yearsF the project said FThese model terms and conditions are entirely unenforcea ble without a Commission requirement for granting accessF The group said it was particularly concerned about the Fincreasing phenomenonF of building owners making direct investments in buildingfoc used CLECs BLECs FThe resulting symbiotic financial relationship motivate s the multitenant building owner to promote its affiliated BLEC within the buildingF it said The FCC should Fdirectly prohibitF building o wners from F unreasonably discriminating among facilitiesbased carriersF it said ATT Corp called for a nondiscriminatory access rule allowing a CLEC to F institute proceedings that if successful could result in an order prohibiting a LEC from providing telecommunications servicesF to any bui lding that refuses to allow Freasonable nondiscriminatory access to competing carriersF The FCC has the authority under sections and of the Communications Act of to stop LECs from serving buildings whose owners engage in discriminatory practices ATT said FThe fact that such regulations ha ve an indirect effect on building ownersFnamely in encouraging them to prov ide their tenants with the telephony choices they deserveFdoes not divest th e Commission of jurisdictionF it said In joint comments Carolina BroadBand Inc RCN Telecom Services Inc an d Utilicom Networks LLC complained that the Fentrenched incumbent local exchange carriers and incumbent cable TV providers frequently misuse thei r established positions to block competition through such means as exclusive contracts with building owners and managersF They noted that the FCCFs further rulemaking notice had said the record didnF t provide a sufficient basis upon which to decide whether barring exclusive contracts in the residential market would be beneficial or detrimental to growth FThere are many competitive obstacles raised by such exclusive arrangements not the least of which is that the ultimate captive tenant mu st wait until the expiration of the contract before obtaining the superior services of another providerF they said Cox Communications Inc cited barriers it encounters when trying to gain access to buildings including Fmonetary demandsF from building owner s and F onerous nonfinancial terms and conditionsF It urged the FCC to adopt a F simple rule that prevents any incumbent from obtaining access to a multitenant building on terms more favorable than those available to any other carrierF BLEC Sees Residential Commercial Differences BLEC CoServ LLC said the FCCFs Freservation about extending the ban o n exclusive arrangements from the commercial to the residential market is warrantedF Residential leases are much shorter than business leases a nd relocation costs are lower for residences it said Residential customers therefore have a Fgreater degree of flexibility in mitigating or simpl y avoiding any limitsF a building owner may put in place with exclusive telecom service agreements it concluded Cypress Communications Inc an Atlantabased BLEC said the FCC should ba r ILECs from signing discriminatory access arrangements with building owners F Such a rule is necessary because ILECs have market power and therefore possess an advantage over CLECsF it said A nondiscrimination requirement applied to CLECs is FunnecessaryF Cy press said because they Flack market power and building owners do not have a n incentive to discriminate on the CLECsF behalfF The FCC shouldnFt keep LECs from serving multitenant buildings whose ow ners refuse to deal with other LECs on a nondiscriminatory basis said BellSouth Corp Such a rule would be Fconstitutionally suspectF Funnecessa ryF and F illconsideredF it said The rule would be Ftoo severe in consequen ce in that it affects the very health safety and livelihood of innocent LEC customersF BellSouth said Verizon Communications IncFs telephone companies asked the FCC to bar all exclusive access arrangements between carriers and multitenant building owners But it should not constrain Fexclusive or preferential marketin g arrangements which are procompetitiveF they say Such arrangements F afford customers an additional source of information on the availability of services and products and an additional sales outlet without any reduction in the many outlets they already haveF the Verizon telcos said SBC Communications IncFs telcos also backed extending the ban on exclu sive access arrangements to cover residential buildings but opposed any effort t o limit marketing agreements They also opposed broadening the definition of rightofway which would be FunworkableF and FinconsistentF wi th state law and the Communications Act of they said The Independent Cable Telecommunications Association said Flimitedter m exclusiveF contracts between multichannel video programming distributors and owners of residential buildings Fcan and do function as a procompetitiv e force in that marketplaceF ICTA also opposed extending the FCCFs rules governing the disposition of cable TV FhomerunF wiring to include providers of telecom services Those rules currently cover providers of video services In joint comments the Edison Electric Institute and the United Telecom Council disagreed with the FCCFs premise that utility rightsofway coul d be construed to include Finbuilding facilities such as riser conduits th at are owned or controlled by a utilityF FAny access right conferred upon cable and telecommunications providers by section must remain subordinate to the rights held by utilities such that a utilityFs ability voluntarily to provide access to an area and ob tain compensation for doing so is a prerequisite to utility ownership or control F under section they said The General Services Administration commenting on behalf of the consumer interests of federal executive agencies didnFt weigh in with specific recommendations But it described problems its agencies have experienced i n trying to order service from CLECs including problems caused by building owners and ILECs that delayed service provisioning The Telecommunications Research and Action Center asked the FCC to prohibit telecom service providers from signing exclusive contracts with owners of multitenant residential buildings It also asked the FCC to revise its cab le TV insidewiring rules to give tenants a broader choice of advanced service providers TRAC said building owners

FCC Says ATU Must Refund M For Misallocating Costs The FCC has ordered an Alaskan local exchange carrier to refund GCI Communications Inc million in damages plus interest to make up for having improperly allocated certain costs to the interstate jurisdiction fo r separations purposes Local exchange carriers must jurisdictionally separa te costs related to facilities that are used for both interstate and intrastat e services so that federal and state regulators can associate the costs with revenues from the appropriate jurisdiction The FCC said Alaska Communications Systems Inc dba ATU Telecommunications had wrongly allocated to the interstate jurisdiction th e trafficsensitive costs of carrying Internetbound calls The FCC also sai d ATU unlawfully exceeded its allowed rate of return on its investment to provide interstate access services during the F monitoring perio d The FCC ordered ATU to revise its tariffs and monitoring reports to reflect the fact that the FCC considers ISPbound traffic to be intrastate in natur e for separations purposes The FCC also found that ATU improperly calculated Fdialequipment minute sF DEM for interoffice calls during that same monitoring period FBy allocating ISP traffic costs to the interstate jurisdiction for separations purposes and by counting one DEM rather than two DEMs for each minute of interoffice calls ATU erroneously inflated its interstate cost baseF t he FCC said in an order released last week in Enforcement file MD GCI also had complained that ATUFs tariffs were unjust and unreasona ble in violation of section b of the Communications Act of because they permitted ATU to exceed its prescribed rate of return and that by assigning Internetbound traffic costs to the interstate jurisdiction ATU unjustly and unreasonably imposed charges on GCI for a service to which it did not subscribe The FCC dismissed those two complaints saying they wer e F mootF and based on the same facts as the complaints on which it ruled in GCIF s favor The FCC said that assigning the costs of Internetbound traffic to the intrastate jurisdiction for separations purposes was Fa legal requiremen tF under rules it established in a order regarding MTS message telephone service and WATS market structure It noted that it had affirmed that leg al requirement in a series of orders most recently in its

FCCFs setaside rules for small businesses also known as Fdesign ated entitiesF DEs have drawn controversy since before the reauction began and are expected to remain a contentious issue The day before the sale began one DE Allegheny Communications Inc aske d the US Court of Appeals in Washington to block the reauction saying the FCC had failed to review the ownership of bidders classified as DEs to

Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission develop its own plan for Verizon Pennsylvania Inc to split up its wholesale and retail operations In his recommendation to the PUC the ALJ criticized VerizonFs FalternativeF plan for not going far enough to separate the companyFs business functions and for being too full of h oles to implement In the PUC ordered the retailwholesale split as part of a Fglobal orderF settling a number of proceedings on issues ranging from reciproca l compensation to universal service TR Aug Also last year Verizon proposed a plan that would allow it to avoid a complete split of it s company by separating the business functions but keeping the company structurally intact TR July Administrative Law Judge Wayne L Weismandel last week recommended giving Verizon a year to create separately operating retail and wholesale affiliates Under his recommendation the two affiliates would be required to maintain separate books records staffs and officers The retail affiliate would not be permitted to obtain financing Fthat would permit a creditor upon default to have recourse to the assets of the Verizon Pennsylvania Inc wholesale affiliateF Under the plan the two affil iates would be required to conduct transactions Fon an armFslength basis F The ALJ said that VerizonFs alternative plan didnFt propose a true wholesaleretail separation but rather a Flineofbusiness split th at does not mitigate the anti competitive dominant market power Verizon currently exercises as a result of its base of legacy monopoly customers F He also blasted the telco for not supplying cost analysis or data to suppor t many of its conclusions FDue to VerizonFs failure to comply with the commissionFs orders i n this proceeding the commission is left with no choice but to direct structural separation of specific elements as the commission deems appropriateF A LJ Weismandel said CompetitorsF Plans Criticized Too Competitors including ATT Corp and WorldCom Corp had submitted

carriers say they generally support the FCCFs proposals to strea mline procedures governing pro forma assignments and transfers of international service authorizations although they also suggest further modifications of the rules But one major provider is asking the FCC to continue requiring foreign affiliates of carriers receiving such authorizations to settle traffic with US carriers at or below settlement rate FbenchmarksF Parties offered their views in comments filed at the FCC last week in response to an International docket notice of proposed rulemaking T R Dec To ease the regulatory burden on international carriers the FCC had propos ed to make its procedures for international service authorizations granted und er section of the Communications Act more like those it uses for assignmen t and transfer of control of commercial mobile radio service CMRS licenses The FCC also tentatively had concluded that it no longer needed to require carriers to comply with its international settlement rate benchmarks as a condition of granting them section authorizations to provide facilitiesbased international private line services It had proposed to stop requiring dominant international carriers to seek prior agency approval before discontinuing service on a route Fexcept w here a carrier possesses market power for international service in the USF In its comments on the FCCFs rulemaking proposal WorldCom Inc said i t supported streamlining and harmonizing the CommissionFs rules But it a sked the agency to retain the benchmark condition for facilitiesbased service t o affiliated markets until Jan ThatFs the last of several deadlines for US carriers to settle traffic with foreign carriers at or below the applicable benchmark rate the FCCFs benchmark order had set different deadlines for various groups of countries FThe incentive for unlawful oneway bypass remains a serious issueF WorldCom said FBy removing this condition the Commission would make it easier than ever for a dominant foreign carrier to circumvent unlawfully the settlement rate benchmarksF It added that it would be difficult for the Commissio n to detect evasion by carriers without the mandate Verizon Communications IncFs international carrier affiliates backed t he streamlining proposals FIn an increasingly competitive environment simplification and streamlining of outdated rules are essential to assure that US carriers are able to compete in the world marketF Verizon sai d It suggested the FCC go further and streamline other rules affecting international service authorizations as well It urged elimination of the following requirements Prior notification for affiliation with nondominant foreign carriers Identification of interlocking directorates with foreign carriers Quarterly international traffic reports required under section of the CommissionFs rules and Amendments of international authorizations when a Bell company receives FCC authorization to provide inregion interLATA local access and transpor t area service in a particular state Verizon Wireless supported changing the rules concerning pro forma assignments and also asked the FCC to eliminate the quarterly reporting requirements mandated by section c Cingular Wireless LLC also backed making section application procedures more like those used for CMRS licenses It

while building networks acquiring other companies a nd trying to enter new markets Determining whether they can pay those and future debts is the job of creditrating agencies like MoodyFs Investors Service Robert Ray a senior vice president in the telecom technology and media group at MoodyFs tells TR that some of the biggest names in telecom li ke ATT Corp are in danger of losing top credit ratings and having to pay mo re interest in their next round of funding An edited transcript of our interview with Mr Ray follows TR What does MoodyFs do WhatFs your role Ray IFm lead analyst for a number of highvisibility companies in medi a technology and telecommunications IFm responsible not only for assign ing ratings to companies but also for monitoring those ratings as companiesF business prospects ebb and flow to make sure that our ratings once assigne d continue to be accurate In case weFre no longer comfortable with the rating itFs my responsi bility to make a recommendation to change the rating of a company TR The news about telecom debt levels has been gloomy see separate story WhatFs your perspective on the financial health of the telecom sector Ray There have been a number of defaults and bankruptcies particularly among the CLECs competitive local exchange carriers There are a number of companies that have tried to enter the market Not all the business plans were fully funded As both the equity and the debt markets have become more restricted companies that didnFt have a fully funded business planFthat didnF t have enough money on hand or committed money from their bank group to cover thei r cash needs over the next to monthsFhave found themselves in liquid ity crunches relatively quickly TR On the equity side a lot of analysts were surprised by what happened in the telecom sector Is there a similar sense on the credit and debt side that investors and their advisers were caught by surprise Ray In the highyield area many of the companies had relatively low ratin gsF singleB or Caa Those ratings donFt necessarily anticipate a certainty of default but they do reflect a high degree of risk Even on the investmentgrade side however weFve seen some surprising developmentsFnot so much in terms of direction but in terms of speedF primarily in the pricing environment for long distance services from companies such as ATT and WorldCom Inc We were aware that those prices were going to come under pressure as the Ba by Bells began to get permission to offer long distance service in their home markets as usage moved from wireline to wireless service and as usage began moving from traditional circuitswitched networks to Internetdeliver ed voice While we knew there were a lot of pressures that were going to bring pricin g down in that market the degree of the falloff was a bit of a surprise even to us As a result the large long distance carriers have had to scale bac k their expectations for profitability in the voice business TR And as a consequence their credit ratings have come under downward pressure Ray Yes ATT has had its longterm rating lowered from A to A and tha t rating remains on review Certainly the pressures from the voice business were part of that But ATT is also in the process of breaking itself up into three separate businesses The review is not only focusing on some of the risks that weFve talked about but also the financial structure that each of these businesses will have going forward WeFve changed the outlook on Sprint Corp from stable to negative WorldCom retains an A rating and a stable outlook While theyFve had s ome pressure like the other players they had a little more flexibility under the current rating to absorb some of those pressures TR How big a deal is it to these companies to have their credit rating go down a step What effect does that have on their daytoday business Ray On the daytoday business it has relatively limited impact To the extent that they would be issuing new debt a lower credit rating normally would result in a higher interest rate The most critical rating for ATT is its shortterm rating of Prime If they didnFt have a Prime rating theyFd be severely limited in thei r ability to sell commercial paper to the money market funds Securities an d Exchange Commission rules limit the amount money market funds can invest in companies that donFt have toptier commercial paper ratings like Prime from at least two rating agencies FEd For a company whose commercial paper outstanding has been between billi on and billion that could result in a significant increase in ATTFs funding costs They would have to seek out for the most part a different group of investors TR Is ATTFs Prime rating under review Ray Yes it is Both the A longterm rating and our Prime shortterm rating are on review for possible downgrade TR Can you give me an example of what the cost of money might be to ATT through a money market fund v the nextbest alternative Ray The money market funds would just be one of a number of investors who would be buying ATTFs commercial paper So donFt get too caught up in their being the only source TR Percentagewise though how much better is commercial paper than the nextbest alternative Ray They would certainly have to pay higher rates To the extent that th ey were reliant on the money market funds for a substantial part of their commercial paper issuance those funds would have to be replaced by investo rs who are less constrained by the rating You can find those investors but they are obviously looking at a lower rating for a higher pricing So it Fs hard to speculate on specifically what any one company might have to pay TR It depends on the day of the week IFm sure Ray And it also depends on the size of the program the marketFs view of how safe the investment is how comfortable investors are with the company Fs prospects and how much similar paper there is A telecom issuer is not only competing against a full range of issuers goin g into the market itFs also competing against other telecom companies for access to the market Most investors set limits on how much theyFre wil ling to expose themselves to any particular industry Once they feel they have enough exposure to the telecom industry theyFre going to be less intere sted in putting that next dollar into telecoms rather than some other opportunit y The other thing weFve seen in the last couple of years is thereFs bee n tremendous need in the telecom industry for financing as companies have bui lt out their networks CLECs have been building networks A number of long distance networks have been built here in the United States Wireless networks are being built There are also international networks not only connecting countries but also within Europe and within AsiaFboth wirelin e and wireless In the US market alone there was over billion worth of media and telecom debt in the first months of compared to about billion in ThatFs just the straight debt market not including equities or convertible debts TR How do you determine a companyFs rating Ray We look at the business risks of a company We try to understand exactly what business theyFre in their competitive position and their strengths and weaknesses We also try to get a good understanding of management and what their appetites may be for business and financial risk We rate virtually all major companies in virtually every industry We also have a solid understanding of the industry broadly and where any particular company fits in terms of its cost structure market share management direction and strategic focus We also obviously do some statistical analysis Since weFre fixedinc ome analysts weFre focused more on ensuring that debt obligations get paid and trying to assess the probability that all obligations will be paid in full in a timely manner A fixedincome investor doesnFt necessarily have the upside that an equi ty holder does A fixedincome holder has one of two results if he buys a security at issuance and holds it to maturity He either gets paid or he doesnFt Even if the companyFs been fabulously successful he just gets his inter est on a regular basis and the principal at maturity If the company just struggles through and barely makes it heFs in the same situation So t hereF s not much upside on straight debt if youFre a buyandhold investor As fixedincome analysts our key measures are the companyFs ability to generate free cash ThatFs cash after meeting all fixed obligations li ke interest and dividends We also look at their ability to finance their capital spending requirements and their cashgenerating capability relative to their debt load If you look at two companies that are basically in the same industry and th at have similar sizes and market positionsFwith neither one possessing any particular competitive advantage in terms of new productsFthe one that h as the stronger cash generation relative to its debt obligations would have a higher rating Probably the most difficult part of our business is making sure that we are consistent in applying our ratings I want to make sure my strongest compa ny has the highest rating and my weakest company has the lowest rating ItFs also important to make sure that what I call an A an A or a Baa is equivalent to the ratings of anyone else in the corporate finance area whether theyFre covering auto companies or coal mines TR How much of your time is spent talking to management and trying to figure out their plans What happens during these talks Ray A large part of our analytical meetings with companies is spent tryin g to understand their strategy their philosophy and their appetite for business and financial risk and looking at what the company has done in th e past and how successful theyFve been in meeting goals that theyFve se t for themselves We look at their plans relative to others in the industry and try to make sure the strategy and the objectives theyFve set are reasonable and achievable The discussion quite frankly in the average meeting tends to be more about the companiesF products and business mix ItFs often beneficial having a longstanding relationship with a company Fs management You develop a sense of comfort regarding managementFs abili ty to forecast the risks they face to come up with plans to address those risks and to develop financial models that are achievable TR It must be an expensive prospect for a company to get its rating lowered and it also may be a bit of an embarrassment How do they react t o the possibility of a downgrade Ray We try to have a pretty good ongoing dialogue with a company so that itF s not a matter of calling them up one day and saying FOh by the way w eFre putting you on review for a downgradeF To the extent that we develop a reas of concern we like to bring them to the companyFs attentionFboth in our direct facetoface meetings and in regular ongoing dialogue over the phone Obviously no company is ever pleased to be put on review for a downgrade Our objective quite frankly is to make sure that they understand and appreciate the position weFve taken and that they know why weFre doin g what weFre doing Even though they ultimately may disagree with the action at least we want to make sure that they understand the logic behind the steps we take And we give them a chance to share with us their view as to why some of our concer ns may be less severe from their perspective TR Do you have any advice for telecom executives investors or regulators What needs to happen for the sector to climb out of its slump Ray For the long distance companies itFs a matter of continuing to ge t their costs in line as best they can knowing that their revenue is going t o continue to be under a lot of pressure for the foreseeable future In the wireless segment the key things are the ability of the wireless players to build out their networks at a reasonable cost and to attract highvalue customersFnot only for voice but also for the emerging wirele ss data marketsFwhile maintaining cost structures that will allow them to continue to be profitable There are more national wireless carriers now and we expect that developme nt will put pressure on pricing We donFt anticipate that itFs going to be as dramatic as the pressure weFve seen recently in the voice wireline secto r But the more competitors you have and the broader their coverage the great er the risk of continued pricing declines TR We havenFt talked much about the Bell companiesFthe ILECs incum bent local exchange carriers WhatFs your outlook for that sector Ray One argument that MoodyFs has been making in support of them for a long time is that they have direct contact with their customers and theyFre also the ones with the line into the house Our ratings on the ILECs are certainly the highest we have in the telecom area They are by and large a strong group of competitors whoFve demonstrated better stability in thei r customer base and revenue mix than the long distance carriers have TR Does the prospect of greater regulatory oversight figure into your calculations regarding the Bells Ray ThereFs a lot of regulatory oversight As they seek to get approv al to provide inregion interLATA local access and transport area service that process has taken a bit longer than we wouldFve expected We anticipated that once the first state and the second state fell other stat es would follow relatively rapidly Telecom SectorFs Dubious Debts Create Drag on Financial Markets The rumblings began in Europe The Bank of England issued warnings follow ed by the Bank of France The major creditrating agenciesFStandard Poor Fs MoodyFs Investors Service and Fitch ICBAFissued ominous reports On the one hand they sounded alarm bells while on the other they said FDonFt p anicF The reason for the caution flags is the level of questionable debt among telecom companies Pessimists fear that so many obligations will go unpaid that the telecom industry singlehandedly will tip the economies of several countries into recessionFas the US real estate industry did in the s when it built too much on borrowed funds before toppling like a rotten tree Even optimists admit that telecom debt is already a drag on the economy I tF s dampening the profits of banks and rippling through related sectors leavi ng experts to wonder how much more bad debt will ooze from the telecom industr y and how many defaults the economy can absorb FFears Are OverdoneF By some estimates telecom service providers have borrowed billion ove r the past three years including bonds and bank loans Analysts generally divide that debt into two sectors The bigger group has been generated by large carriers like ATT Corp British Telecommunications plc and France Telecom SA If one of those companies went under it would be a catastrophe But analysts donFt think thatFs likely TheyFre more concerned about smaller service providers like competitive local exchange carriers CLECs Fortunately those carriers arenFt tho ught to carry enough debt to bring down a major bank let alone an entire indust ry or an economy FAt this stage MoodyFs is not forecasting defaults by major telecoms F MoodyF s Investors service says in a recent report FOn the other hand defaul ts by more marginal operators cannot be excluded However if a bank is not massively exposed to such borrowers its credit strength should not be structurally hurt let alone the fundamentals of the banking systemF Fitch ICBA issued a similar statement FLarge profitable and creditwo rthyF telecom operators are responsible for the bulk of the debt load Fitch says FExposure to the riskier alternative operator sector is in relative te rms modestF FFears of a

in the last months is investment grade and unlikely to default While the amount of loans made to the telecom sector in Europe is unprecedented we do not thin k the telecom debt issue will sink financial marketsF Those assessments donFt mean there wonFt be pain for the telecom comp anies and their lenders on both sides of the Atlantic The danger for banks is that their books will look uglier their profits will sink and their stock prices will tank Bank of America Corp and First Union Corp for example recently missed their profit goals partly because of largerthanexpected loanloss

comments in a recent report Banks traditionally were reluctant to fund moneylosing companies They changed tacks during the dotcom frenzy on Wall Street If they lent money to a young company some

at Bear Stearns Co are less sanguine The debt market appears to have regained its footing Bear Stearns analysts say but the recovery could be stymied by fear uncertainty and market failures F The telecom sector remains prone to headline riskF they say suggesting that the struggling market wonFt be able to absorb bad news Debt markets are especially vulnerable in Europe where large carriers are selling FnoncoreF assets and holding initial public offerings IPOs of stock to raise badly needed funds Bear Stearns notes Those funds will help carriers reduce their debts and pay for expensive new wireless networks B ut what if nobody is willing to buy the assets or invest in the IPOs Many analysts view France TelecomFs IPO of its wireless subsidiary Oran ge plc as a crucial test of EuropeFs capital markets If stockmarket investors donFt support that IPO analysts fear that the budding recover y will wilt FIPOs and noncore disposals must succeedF Messrs Crehan and Secker of Morgan Stanley declare FThe situation has reached an impasse Telecom companies need to spend moreFon network buildout and upgradesFto rea lize a return on their original investment But financial markets are reluctant t o risk even more moneyF FIf the European equity markets do not support IPOs necessary capitalraising steps could be delayed refocusing investors and the rating agencies on credit ratingsF Bear Stearns says FDelayed plans might force the international telecom giants to turn to the banks at a time when the banks are more closely scrutinizing their loan portfoliosF Vendors Become Lenders The type of lending that seems to worry analysts most is vendor financing in which equipment vendors give carriers loans in exchange for guaranteed equipment orders Vendor financing was much less common before last April when the stock market still was the best source of funding for telecom companies When stock market investors closed their doors many telecom companies went to the bond market When bonds dried up they visited banks Rejected by banks many carriers turned to vendors Analysts are nervous because vendors sometimes arenFt qualified to judge creditworthiness and administer loan programs But the vendors are eager t o snag customers FOffering financing has quickly developed into a compet itive weapon by equipment manufacturers keen to take market shareF Messrs Cr ehan and Secker explain FThe aggressive expansion of vendor financing has raised fears that equi pment manufacturers could suffer like the banks should there be widespread defaultF Messrs Crehan and Secker said FArguably the equipment manufacturers are more exposed to this risk since by definition vendor financing is lending to companies that the banks and financial markets have refusedF Vendor financing worries already have stung some manufacturers Lucent Technologies Inc for example recently increased its provision for bad debts to million from million damaging its financial standing in the process TR Dec Vendor financing defaults wonFt hurt only vendors analysts say but als o could cause equipment manufacturers to turn around and default on their lendersFnot a positive development in a year when Standard PoorFs a lready expects an increase in defaults by debtladen telecom companies FTom Leithauser Conn Draft Decision Would Let SNET Drop Cable TV Business The Connecticut

top cabinetlevel positions out of the way President Bush is expected to begin shifting his attention to selectin g lowerlevel political appointees including the FCC chairman and the administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA Late last week speculation was rife that a decision on the FCC top spot was imminent with a handful of insiders even predicting that a new chairman could be appointed over the inaugural weekend or at the beginning of this week One factor that several GOP insiders say could spur quick action from the White House is the prospect of having Democratic Commissioner Susan Ness assume the chairmanFs duties As the most senior Commissioner at the FC C Ms Ness would slide into that role absent an interim appointment by the president notes one longtime FCC observer FAnd that just doesnFt s it too well with a Republican administrationF the source said Most Washington insiders expect Commissioner Michael K Powell to be named interim chairman as no Senate confirmation is needed for a sitting Commissioner to assume that post FMr Powell is viewed by many as some one who can get the FCC up and running without a learning curveF an industr y source told TR But the question of who gets the permanent FCC job has been the topic du jo ur for most telecom industry watchers Sources say Texas Public Utility Commission Chairman Patrick H Wood III has been positioning himself for th at role but Mr Powell also is considered a frontrunner for the position if he wants it Under one scenario floated by a GOP insider President Bush would name Mr Powell interim chairman and then later on nominate Mr Wood as permanent chairman and a new Democrat to replace Ms Ness Ms NessF term expired in June she currently is serving under a recess appointment that thenPresident Clinton made late last month TR Dec She may continue in her position until a replacement is nominated by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate or until the end of the current congressional session L Ari Fleischer a Bush transition team spokesman who was slated to become White House spokesman after the inauguration gave few clues during a Jan press briefing

International Detariffing Intercarrier Compensation in Biennial Review The FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline a broad range of Commission rules including those governing intercarrier compensation for terminating telecom traffic wireless licensing terms and renewals and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange carriers The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan in Common Carrie r docket The biennial regulatory review provisions of the Communications Act of require the agency in evennumbered years to decide whether given rules remain in the public interest the FCC said The FCC doesnFt have to take final action repealing or modifying the rul es in the evennumbered years it said The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revis ed version of the September staff report on the biennial regulatory revie w TR Sept The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare rulemaking notices on the following F Identifying alternative approaches to intercarrier compensation Fthat are more consistent with the longterm development of competitionF F Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incu mbent local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate subsidiaries F Simplifying FCC review of the Faverage schedulesF used in det ermining certain telcosF costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier Association IncFs revenue pools and F Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the administrative costs of the association which was created by FCC directive to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the following streamlining efforts F Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carrier s Fincluding commercial mobile radio service providers and US carriers classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliationsF F Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing processes F Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licens es to save processing time F Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and assignments of international facilities authorizations under section of the Communications Act of and F Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking notices to pursue the following streamlining goals F Considering whether to eliminate restrictions Fon the aggregate a mount of broadband PCS personal communications service cellular and specialized mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any marketF F Extending license terms beyond years and implementing automatic o r default renewal procedures to avoid latefiling problems F Considering partially privatizing

Office of Engineering and Technology to prepar e rulemaking notices to address the following issues F Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminatin g ambiguities in equipment test procedures including authorization procedure s for transmitters that operate both in the US and overseas and F Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum ab ove gigahertz The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new rules it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review t o evaluate existing rules It stopped short however of adopting any criter ia in binding rules or procedures The FCC rejected a proposal the US Telecom Association had offered in comments on the September staff report TR Oct USTA had asked the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified a s unnecessary during biennial reviews Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain flexibility the FCC directed all bureaus and offices Fto prioritize rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of comments receivedF in response to the planned rulemaking notices Issuing a separate statement Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth said t he FCC shouldnFt view the biennial reviews as Fa burden to be endured or a hoop through which we must dutifully jump every other yearF He added FA s the Commission moves forward it is my sincere hope that we will devote fulltime yearround staff to this endeavor FurchtgottRoth Says Departure Of Kennard WonFt Bring Deadlock Although the departure of FCC Chairman William E Kennard leaves the agency temporarily with four membersFtwo Republicans and two DemocratsFCommi ssioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth doesnFt expect the agency to be deadlocked FA lot is made about the political divisionsF at the FCC he said Jan during his monthly briefing with

said FCha irman Kennard has been very principled about this not trying to do a lot of thhour rulesF Meanwhile Mr FurchtgottRoth said the FCC had made Fsignificant progr essF in its second Fbiennial reviewF of its regulations The Telecommunic ations Act of directs the FCC to review its regulations every two years and t o eliminate or revise any rules that are no longer necessary or in the public interest Last week the FCC issued a report on what rule changes it would propose as a result of its second biennial review see separate story The report represents a Fsubstantial improvement over the really patheti c effort that was done two years agoF when the agency conducted its first biennial review TR Jan Mr FurchtgottRoth said Mr FurchtgottRoth also reiterated his complaints about the FCCFs coordination with other agencies in reviewing mergers and related license transfers Regarding the proposed Deutsche Telekom AGFVoiceStream Wirel ess Corp merger Mr FurchtgottRoth disagreed with the FCCFs decision to p ut its review on hold while the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe national security concerns TR Dec He said it would be inappropriate for the FCC to impose conditions on the merger that are requested by DoJ and FBI That however has been the FCC Fs practice in past merger reviews he said Time Warner Telecom Inc intends to raise as much as

that was in bankruptcy TR Sept UWB Operations Feasible In F GHz Band NTIA Says Ultrawideband UWB devices likely can operate in spectrum between and gigahertz without harming incumbent users including fixed satellite servic e FSS operators according to test results released last week by the Nation al Telecommunications and Information Administration But NTIA said that step s to mitigate interference probably would be necessary NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part of its rules TR Nov Separate tests of UWB devicesF effect on Global Positioning System GPS receivers are expected to be released next month The test results release d last week involved only nonGPS operations Results Will Aid Decision Making NTIA Administrator Gregory L Rohde said at a Jan news conference that the test results Fwill form the basis of negotiations between NTIA and t he FCC to develop a final rule that will permit the development and availabili ty of ultrawideband technologiesF UWB devices use precisely timed pulses of radio frequency RF energy sprea d across a wide swath of spectrum at extremely low power Proponents of the technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications including law enforcement fire and rescue services the military medicine education a nd home and office local area networks TR Sept They say it won Ft interfere with existing systems But aviation groups the GPS and satellite industries and others have expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems TheyFve asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show t hey wonFt cause such interference In its tests NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices on federal airroute surveillance radar airport surveillance radar and air traffic control beacon systems Based on the results of those tests NTIA engineers developed mathematical models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems includin g those operating between and megahertz or and GHz The tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range although limits might need to be placed on power levels distance and pulserepetition frequency However thereFs a question about whether UWB devices would have a Fbig enough windowF to operate if restrictions are imposed Mr Roh de said Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users F GHz micr owave landing services F GHz and Doppler weather radar F GHz For FSS systems Fthe worstcase situationF with regard to interferen ce F would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna elevation angle of degreesF NTIAFs report said There would be m uch less interference potential for FSS systems on tops of buildings or with higher elevation angles it said FHowever at this time uncertainty exists as to the effect of UWB signal duty cycle on the performance of FSS earth stations which have digital signal processingF the report said FThis information would assist in esta blishing the UWB signal peak power limit NTIA study is continuing on this important considerationF Regarding microwave landing services UWB operations at power limits currently permitted for part devices may exceed the receiver interferenc e protection standard More analysis of the effect on such systems is needed NTIA said Tests on systems operating between and MHz and F MHz suggested there could be significant interference problems with incumbent systems NTIA officials said at the news conference But NTIAFs report indicated that UWB operations below GHz were possi ble It said that while UWB operations in that spectrum Fwill be quite challengingF mitigating factors Fcould relax restrictionsF on UWB devices It also said that UWB emission levels would have to be significantly reduce d to guard against interference And it concluded that further studies are needed to assess degradation of existing systems as well as relative level s of noise interference and Fclutter signalsF Mr Rohde said NTIA engineers used existing standards for determining the potential interference of UWB devices FObviously this is going to be a n area thatFll be the subject of a lot of debate as to what really is the criteria that determines interferenceF he added Findings Draw Praise NTIAFs test results drew praise from the UWB industry Officials of Tim e Domain Corp a leading marketer of UWB technology said they were still reviewing NTIAFs findings But they indicated they were happy the tests showed the devices could share nonGPS spectrum FWhile we have questions regarding some of the conclusions made by NTIA we are pleased that the test results confirm that compatible operation of UWB devices with government services is possibleF said Jeffrey L Ross Tim e DomainFs vice presidentcorporate development and strategy FWe have full confidence that the FCC will impose appropriate regulations and power limit s and look forward to the FCCFs timely completion of its rulemakingF h e added Last year Time Domain questioned NTIAFs testing methods saying they mu st reflect realworld conditions to be accurate TR Sept Another developer of UWB devices Fantasma Networks Inc also hailed the test results FWe are confident that our deployment of ultrawideband devices does not pose a threat of harmful interference to public safety agencies or to any other user of the radio spectrumF said Roberto Aiell o FantasmaFs chief technology officer Angelos Amends Lawsuit Against Wireless Industry As expected noted plaintiffsF attorney Peter G Angelos has entered the legal fray against the wireless industry over the safety of mobile phones Mr Angelos has filed an amended lawsuit on behalf of a Maryland doctor who claims that using a mobile phone caused his brain tumor TR Aug and Dec The lawsuit filed last week in the US District Court in Maryland seeks million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages The lawsuit says the industry failed to conduct adequate testing on the health effects of mobile phones and warn consumers about known risks The industry Fmanipulated the results of other testing concealed evidence t hat mobile phone radiation is harmful and suppressed scientific and medical researchF the lawsuit alleges According to the lawsuit the medical and scientific communities have been aware of the biological effects of radio frequency RF exposure since the s The wireless industry was or should have been aware of evidence of such health hazards the lawsuit alleges Michael F Altschul vice president and general counsel of the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association which is named in the lawsuit said he hadnFt seen the amended complaint FRegardless of who the lawyer is the legal requirements remain the s ameF Mr Altschul said The plaintiffs have to show a link between RF radiation exposure and cancer he said and Fthat science just isnFt thereF Spokesmen for Motorola Inc and Verizon Communications Inc which also are named as defendants have made similar points Last weekFs amended lawsuit Christopher J Newman et al v Motorola I nc et al case no CCB was filed after US District Judge Catherine C Blake last month dismissed a number of the counts in the original filing but gave the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint The wireless industry had succeeded in moving the case from Baltimore City Circuit Court to federal court Mr Angelos owner of the Baltimore Orioles has won major cases against th e asbestos industry and represented Maryland in litigation against the tobacc o industry John A Pica a lawyer in Mr AngelosF Baltimore firm has be en quoted saying Mr Angelos plans to file lawsuits this year against the wireless industry Messrs Angelos and Pica could not be reached for comme nt Bob Gordon a consultant to Baltimore attorney Joanne Lynch Suder who file d the original lawsuit on behalf of the Maryland doctor said Mr Angelos agreed to be the cocounsel in a number of cases that Ms Suder planned to file against the phone industry Lawyers around the country also are worki ng on the planned litigation he said Meanwhile last week German researchers said there could be a link between the use of mobile phones and cancer of the inner eye The results were published in the January issue of the research journal Epidemiology But the researchers who interviewed subjects with eye cancer and a control group of people said their findings were inconclusive because of the studyFs limitations In a statement CTIA cited those limitations a nd the small size of the study group NTIA Proposes Reimbursement Procedures For Relocated Government Spectrum Us ers The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is proposing procedures for relocating federal government spectrum incumbents to other bands to make way for commercial users Among the issues to be decided are the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement NTIA Administrator Gregory L Rohde said the rules could bolster a highlev el effort to identify and allocate spectrum for thirdgeneration G wireless services ThenPresident Clinton launched the initiative by executive memorandum in October TR Oct Nov and Nov and Jan As part of that effort NTIA is studying the possible use of the F megahertz band which is used heavily by the Defense Department The FCC i s analyzing use of the F MHz band which is used mostly by multich annel multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service operators NTIAFs proposed rules would cover such future reallocations Mr Rohde s aid at an industrygovernment meeting on the G plan last week He said he hop ed the final rules would be released this summer The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year required privat e entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or modifying their systems because of reallocation The notice of proposed rulemaking NTIA released Jan suggests ways to implement that mandate Comments are due March with replies due April in docket no In its rulemaking notice NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technicall y possible in their present bands If the incumbents are not required to relocate under what conditions shoul d they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for an y system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing NTIA asks For example it asks should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the ba nd on a noninterference basis with G systems NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a F comparable facilityF is available for a reasonable period of time It defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operationa l capabilities as the original spectrum NTIA suggests using four factors to determine comparability communications throughput system reliability operating costs and operational capability It seeks comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs including a mandatory negotiation period thirdparty mediation and nonbinding arbitration NTIA seeks comments on what type of costsharing plan to adopt and asks whether a Fband managerF or some other entity should serve as a clear inghouse to administer the plan And it wants input on whether it should Fsunset F a costsharing plan five years after any auction of former government spectrum The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectru m with classified frequency assignments At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of and the Balanced Budget Act of NTIA identified MHz of spectrum that can b e reallocated from federal government to private use The bands identified f or which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are F MHz F MHz F MHz and F MHz The FCC has proposed allocating the F MHz band for G services In addition Mr Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the F MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the G initiative Rohde Uncertain of EffortFs Future At last weekFs G meeting Mr Rohde said he didnFt know if the Bush administration would make any changes to the G effort which is operating on a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for G spectrum b y Sept But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings with Bush transition team staff members FI canFt predict whatFs going to happenF beyond Inauguration Day Mr Rohde told reporters The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA James Derderian a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee couldn Ft be reached for comment But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce secretary earlier this month Donald L Evans said the Bush administration was committed to finding G spectrum TR Jan Industry Expresses Frustration At last weekFs meeting several industry representatives expressed frustration that they didnFt have access to data they said they needed t o make recommendations on use of the F MHz and F MHz ba nds in time for NTIA and the FCC to consider Industry representatives in NTIAestablished working groups are reviewing the bands The G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released i n March with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in Ju ly Rick Kemper directorwireless technology and security for the Cellular Telecommunications Internet Association said determining the cost of relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how they are being used But he said that data wasnFt available Donald Brittingham directorwireless policy for Verizon Wireless said he was concerned that the final band studies wouldnFt reflect all the indus tryFs input He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports FOne concern is weFre going to do a lot of

directorspectrum plans and policies said some information wouldnFt be available until the final band studies were released FUnfortunately time happens to be our enemy hereF Mr We ntland added But he urged industry officials to continue participating in the process including filing comments in response to the FCCFs recent notice of prop osed rulemaking on G spectrum TR Jan Diane J Cornell associate chief of the FCCFs Wireless Telecommunicatio ns Bureau said the current process was designed Fto crystalize the issues F and she urged industry engineers to focus on technical issues concerning band sharing and segmentation Ms Cornell also said industry should submit comments in response to NTIA Fs notice and an FCC rulemaking notice released in November suggesting allocations for MHz of spectrum transferred from government to private u se TR Nov After the final band studies are released in March she said FI expect there will be differences of perspectivesF She said industry officials would get another chance to submit comments after that AntennaRule Violations Prompt Proposed Forfeitures of K The FCC and its Enforcement Bureau have proposed that two wireless carriers and two tower companies pay for violations of its antenna rules The largest proposed forfeiture was against American Tower Corp for violations in states and Washington DC The FCC has ordered the Enforcement Bureau to conduct a more thorough investigation of American Tow erF s compliance with its rules Separately the Enforcement Bureau proposed an forfeiture against Telecorp Communications Inc an forfeiture against ATT Wireless Services Inc and an forfeiture against SpectraSite Corp In a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture the FCC said American Tow er failed to properly light an antenna during construction register t wo existing antennas notify the agency of ownership changes involving antennas and post registration numbers on nine antennas FWe are concerned that ATC continues to violate our rules despite both o ral and written warnings regarding the CommissionFs antenna structure requirementsF the FCC said in its Jan forfeiture notice It said m ore than half of American TowerFs violations were uncovered after a July meeting between FCC field agents and American Tower officials In separate notices released the same day the Enforcement Bureau found tha t Telecorp failed to light antennas properly on four occasions and that ATT Wireless failed to post antenna registration numbers on nine occasions It also found that SpectraSite failed to post antenna registration numbers on four occasions and failed to notify the FCC of ownership changes on three occasions The violations were discovered by FCC field agents during routi ne investigations and

State Immunity Issue The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit New Orleans echoing thre e other appellate circuits has ruled that the US Constitution doesnFt protect state utility commissions from federal judicial review of their decisions regarding carrier interconnection agreements In a twotoone decision issued Jan the Fifth Circuit rejected th Amendment immunity claims raised by the Louisiana Public Service Commission during proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed by ATT Corp ATT was challenging the PSCFs arbitration decision regarding its interconne ction agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications Inc Section of the Telecommunications Act of directed state commission s to review approve and when necessary arbitrate carrier interconnection agreements The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropria te federal district court to the review the carrier agreement In ATT Communications v BellSouth Telecommunications Inc et al case no the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the US District Cou rt in Baton Rouge The lower court had held that the th Amendment to the U S Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees ATT had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit The th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the US Supreme Court in its decision in Ex parte Young The Ex parte Young doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoin g violations of federal law The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the interconnection dispute under the provisions of the Act The court al so ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to ATTFs request for prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that ATT had argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections and of the Act The appeals court reversed the district courtFs ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings Circuit Judge James L Dennis wrote the opinion a nd was joined by Judge Henry A Politz Judge Jerry E Smith dissented from t he majorityFs opinion Finding Echoes Other Circuits Appeals courts in the Sixth Seventh and th Circuits already have held that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection

It sought comment on its initial characterization of ITV as a F service that supports subscriberinitiated choices or actions that are related to one or more video programming streamsF The FCC asked about the technical resources or Fbuilding blocksF a distribution system would require to support ITV The FCC said it saw thre e major building blocks a video stream a twoway highspeed Intern et protocol connection and specialized customer premises equipment FTo assess the possibilities for discriminatory behavior and what enforc ement procedures might be effective for any rules that might be

also asked whether cable TV providers would have the Fsuperior platfo rmF for distribution of highspeed ITV service and sought comment on the ITV capabilities of direct broadcast satellite providers and digital subscriber line service providers The FCC also sought comment on the legal classifications of ITV services what public and statutory objectives ITV rules would promote and what authority the FCC has over such services The notice states that the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of directed the FCC to adopt rules Flimiting the sh are of cable capacity that could be used for commonly owned content and requiri ng vertically integrated cable programmers to provide their content to rival distribution platforms on nondiscriminatory termsF The FCC added that if the Fsame factual predicates that Congress cited in the Cable Act w ere to apply to a distribution platform delivering ITV services then some regulation of those distribution facilities might be warrantedF The notice also asks for comment on how the FCC could implement rules to ba r providers of multichannel video programming from discriminating against unaffiliated ITV providers It asked for

about the FCCFs legal authority to address ITV issues Robert Sachs president and chief executive officer of the National Cable Television Association was FpleasedF that the FCC was launching an i

International Inc He said he expected a QwestSprint merger to be announced in the next months Merger activity in general may increase under a Republican administration Mr Reingold asserted But some combinations will remain difficult or impossible because traditional antitrust laws and the Telecommunications Ac t of will stand in the way no matter who is in power he said For example he said

broadcasters with licenses for channels F now occupy large chunks of the spectrum and donFt have to leave until at the earlies t as part of the transition to digital TV Mr Scott said the uncertainty over when incumbent broadcasters would leave the spectrum was still an issue He also noted that the FCC hadnFt yet adopted proposed bandclearing mechanisms for those frequencies Even if such mechanisms were adopted immediately MHz band auction bidders woul dnF t have time to use them he said Mr Scott also mentioned the highlevel governmentindustry effort to identify and allocate spectrum

bands That order is expected this summer FThere remains considerable uncertainty about the process for the auctio n the availability of the MHz band itself and the availability of alternate spectrumF Mr Scott said in the letter FAs a matter of s ound spectrummanagement policy this spectrum should not be auctioned until the se issues are resolvedF FConducting the auction before prospective bidders

though rural telcos serve only a small percentage of the telecom market their operations cover nearly o f the nationFs land and in many cases theyFre entering multiple lines of business ThatFs the message the National Telephone Cooperative Associa tion is carrying to the FCC and Congress as it seeks to garner more federal support for some of its pet projects On Capitol Hill NTCA plans to revive its legislative push to eliminate cap s on the amount that individual carriers are eligible to receive in universal service support says Chief Executive Officer Michael Brunner The association is considering broadening that proposal to include a broadband tax credit plan he says At the FCC the groupFs most pressing concern is getting quick adoption of the multiassociation group MAG plan for overhauling the interstate access charge system for telcos operating under rateofreturn regulation Mr Brunner tells TR An edited transcript of our conversation follows TR What are NTCAFs top priorities for the th Congress Should we e xpect to see your proposal from the last Congress to lift the universal service c ap Brunner The answer is yes As you know we were instrumental in working with Sen Conrad Burns R Mont in getting that bill introduced in the last session Obviously thatFs a priority again as the Rural Task Forc e has sort of come up with half a loaf in recommending an index cap We see the Rural Task Force plan as better obviously than the current situation but we see it causing a problem down the road For example if a lot of acquisitions occurFand I think they willFthen thereFs going to be a need to upgrade all those lines The current cap wonFt be adequate to do that and we hope the Commission under any circumstances wouldnFt go below what the Rural Task Force is recommending TR That effort garnered bipartisan backing from key US senators last session WhatFs your strategy for expanding congressional support for i t in the th Congress Brunner One way to do that might be to go back to the drafting of the Telecommunications Act of when Congress really understood that we hav e to give equal weight to the twin goals of competition and universal service Our feeling is that this Commission and the past Commissions perhaps may have given more weight to competition and less to universal service ItFs real clear in the statute that Congress thinks those issues are equ ally weighted and whether or not people like it things cost more in rural America If we really want to bring broadband services to all Americans w e canFt do it without some kind of support And if Congress is saying on the one hand FDeploy advanced servicesF it seems odd to say on the other hand FWeFre going to limit this cap l imit the supportF Rep Nathan Deal R Ga was our key guy in the House on this last year and Sen Burns in the Senate WeFre working with a lot of other people too to see if we canFt be more comprehensive this time around For example another key component of our plan could be some kind of tax credit or a lowinterest Rural Utilities Service loan And rather than have one bill address this part and one for that part we may have all of those wind up in one comprehensive package On the broadband tax credit plan the idea is to develop a bill that would enable carriers to claim a fairly substantial credit for deploying broadband services to rural areas We donFt want it to be technology specific where you end up with something that seems to favor one technolog y over the other I donFt want to be too specific because weFre still working with a nu mber of our own members to work out the details We donFt have a perfect packag e yet and I donFt think it would be hugely expensive We realize no o neFs going to go for a big spending bill especially with the economy sort of turning right now or potentially turning But weFre still moving forward on this Our annual meeting will be held the first week in February and thatFs when weFre really going to start h ashing out some of these things and talking about some overall policy resolutions TR One thing you havenFt mentioned is a deregulatory approach to broad band service deployment Why Brunner We really havenFt been drawn to that approach for a lot of rea sons one being that we think a broadband tax credit bill is a more targeted approach that really gets at the issue If the policymakers really want t o deploy broadband services nationwide and they say they do this is the way to help us to do it TR Staying on the congressional front whatFs NTCAFs reaction to Fr ed Upton R Mich who has limited telecom experience being named chairman of th e House Energy and Commerce CommitteeFs telecommunications subcommittee Brunner WeFre excited about Fred Upton being in that role He does ha ve some rural parts to his district in fact some of our own commercial telco members are up thereFBloomingdale Telephone Co of Bloomingdale Mich and Climax Telephone Co of Climax Mich Also the ratio now in the House is about urban members to one rural member So whenever you get a person with some rural territory in a key telecom policymaking slot NTCA is thrilled We think that Mr Upton will do a good job and hope heFll be sensitive to NTCAFs issues TR I understand that youFve been consulting with members of Congress a bout the MAG plan and that some senators have asked the FCC to put it on the fro nt burner What kind of time line do you have in mind for action on the MAG plan Brunner We want to move it quickly WeFve spent a lot of time as hav e other trade associations getting our members on board It was a grueling process and I think the productFs pretty good So our feeling at this point is that we really want the whole thing adopted as is WeFre not comfortable backing off any part of it If the Commission doe s back off or review it then we reserve the right to say FStop and let Fs look at it againF The main thing is keeping the process moving ItFs easy for things to g et bogged down in the regulatory or congressional processes We have many friends on Capitol Hill mainly in the Senate where so many members have k ey rural areas in their state The main message right now is FLetFs ke ep the MAG plan movingF Most people think itFll probably take six months to a year to get the wh ole thing through The other wild card to some extent is the Rural Task Forc e report which is moving along on a fast track ThereFs some commonality between those two Our dreamFalthough we thought it probably wasnFt super likelyFwas that the Commission would just simply adopt the MAG plan as i s TR What about the expected turnover at the FCC How do you see that affecting the CommissionFs consideration of the MAG plan Brunner It could go a bunch of different ways You could get someone coming in who says FA lot of real smart people spent a lot of time on t his and rather than reinvent the wheel IFm more inclined to support itF Or you could get someone else who says FI donFt understand all this and I want to start from square one and take my timeF We just donFt know who the players are going to be I expect some of the current Commissioners still will be there TR Most believe Commissioner Michael K Powell will be tapped to fill the vacant chairman seat at least initially Have you gotten any feedback fro m his office about his position on the MAG plan Brunner Not really WeFve visited the staffs of all the Commissioners and most of them werenFt real specific on the plan So we certainly want to give him and others the benefit of the doubt We hope they would view it favorably I think everyone will respect the work that went into it even if they donFt agree with it TR LetFs talk about your recent white paper recommending that universa l service FhighcostF support be FnonportableF TR Jan Ho w did you come to this conclusion and where do you go with it Brunner What weFve got there is a study with some actual data It sho ws that introducing competition in rural areas is ultimately going to lead to less broadband technology deployment Our next step is to try to convince regulators that artificial competition doesnFt work If thereFs an actual market for more than one carrier then indeed consumers might benefit But there arenFt great public benefits as we see it to artificially creating competition where markets donFt ordinarily permit competition as a matter of course Our point is that sometimes the regulators try to take an urban solution an d inject it into rural America It makes sense to induce competition in downtown areas like Los Angeles or Chicago where the average Bell company has anywhere from to customers per mile But we only have four or five or six per mileFvery small numbers We would argue that itFs hard for one carrier to really make it in these markets And if they force a second one or a third one in it splits up th e business even more and no oneFs going to have the wherewithal to delive r broadband services One of our main themes on Capitol Hill and at the Commission is that policymakers need to appreciate the fact that rural areas are different Most policymakers as you might imagine have an urban background Our job is to continue to try to educate people about the differences between urban and rural areas WeFve done that with some success For example weFve had several of the Commissioners come out and speak at our meetings spend time with our members talk with them oneonone Commissioner Harold W FurchtgottRoth for example came out and visited a small telco with us We really look for opportunities to give them a greater appreciation of these kinds of things Going back to Congress we also want to really caution people not to reopen up the Telecommunications Act or to pass a new Act until some of the key rural issues are resolved WeFre now going on five years since passage of the Telecommunications Act and some of our members still canFt plan bec ause they donFt know about the outcome of access charge reform As you kno w our members get better than of their revenues from access charges The biggest decisions for the new Commission will be on highcost support a nd access charge reform Both the MAG and the Rural Task Force plans have touched on that TR Switching gears to the incoming Bush administration how do you forese e the Department of AgricultureFs Rural Utilities Service RUS developing over the next few years Will there be major changes Brunner Actually to be honest no one knows My sense is that the RUS n o longer is the political issue it used to be because when people look at it theyFre seeing that the cost of that program is so minute ItFs some where around million or million in interest subsidies for about millio n in loans And everyone thinks it does work well thereFs never been a default So I donFt sense weFre going to have an effort as was made in the Reagan administration to really cut back on some of these things I could be totally wrong but my sense is it has enough respect and support on both sides of the aisle Plus the lending no longer is simply for the same Fplain old telephone serviceF itFs now for some new things TR LetFs talk about NTCAFs membership What kind of efforts are un der way to accommodate some of your membersF nonILEC incumbent local exchange carrier operations Brunner Many years ago there were questions about how our members would adapt to change in competition My sense is that theyFre adapting quite well as almost all of them are in multiple lines of business TheyFre becoming Internet service providers many of them are in the cable TV business most of them have wireless or broadcast satellite operations som e are resellers and many are becoming CLECs competitive local exchange carriers TheyFve gotten into multiple lines of business so they are becoming in a lot of ways more than ILECs WeFve broadened our approach to assist th em in some other areas So itFs a very active membership some more than othe rs We have a new initiative called CA ItFs really an effort to get membe rs who are thinking more competitively to get together and perhaps aggregate their businesses with things like volume discounts IFve been very pleased with our membershipFs willingness to grow and change For a while I thought they just might want to keep doing things the same ol d way that has always worked for them But they really are changing WeFre not the biggest player WeFre only about of the industry b ut it really is a critical We represent roughly of the land in this country but itFs a unique and critical part We would just really hope that the policymakers would make it a priority t o understand that the we serve is as important as the whole ThatFs something that some people miss Executive Briefings The New FCC F
