know Yes if the IF vol curve exists use IFvol NG skew if IF vol curve does not exsist use NG vol NG skew Original Message From Song Jennifer Sent Tuesday November AM To Jones Brad Subject vol skew Brad I did two postids I used the current production portcalc to calculate and I used the old version to calculate I do see a P L change on I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P L value Enclosed is a partial list of those deals The reasons are In old version we calculate volatility of basis options like this we calculate the NG volatility If its a basis option we fetch the IF volatility curve If IF volatility curve exists we use IFvolatility curve If IF volatility curve does not exist we still use NG volatility In the current production version we calculate volatility of basis options like this we calculate the NG volatility NG vol skew The NG vol skew is based on NG price fixed price If its a basis option we fetch the IFvolatility curve If IFvolatility curve exists we use IF volatility curve If IFvolatility curve does not exist we still use NG volatility NG vol skew which was calculated in step The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step we didnt apply vol skew upon IF vol In our new fix this bug will be fixed However the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist So the current production version used the NG vol NG vol skew for those deals The old version used the NG vol for those deals Thus you see PL change in these two versions Also wed like to confirm with you that in the new fix if the IF vol curve does not exist you still want us to use NG vol NG vol skew instead of erroring out If the IF vol curve exists we will use IF vol NG vol skew Thanks Jennifer Jinwen Jennifer Song File basisxls
