<15817789.1075863286500.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,wolak@zia.stanford.edu,2001-10-19 14:27:56,Vince Ive been hearing rumors that Enron has decided to endorse the nodal pricing model as implemented in PJM I just wanted to warn you that Im not sure this is in Enrons longterm interest at all Let me explain why Feel free to give me a call if youd like to talk more about this First let me say that I firmly believe in locational pricing and specifically pricing congestion However the way that PJM implements nodal pricing is to eliminate as much price volatility and reduce the transparency of the market Specifically the PJM tariff gives the ISO the ability to mitigate to cost plus a adder the bids of any market participant that the ISO deems is out of merit in one of the three zones in region The fact that a nodal market is talking about zones should give you cause for alarm Then the ISO takes this mitigated bid and reruns its pricesetting software to compute new nodal prices The way I have somewhat unfairly decribed this pricesetting process is that the PJM ISO decides what prices it would like for a given day and mitigates bids until it gets them This is not a transparent market nor one where it makes any sense to buy the risk management services that Enron provides The only price volatility you have to worry about in the PJM market is that kind that comes about if they need imports into their control area to meet demand Under these circumstances you need to pay the imports whatever is necessary to get them to come to your market However bear in mind FERCs desire to make a large RTO on the East Coast This will effectively mean little imports to the East Coast RTO so all bids can be mitigated at the discretion of the ISO Paying marketclearing prices to costofservice mitigated bids is just paying too much to eliminate price volatility It effectively kills off the development of risk management at the wholesale and retail level Power marketing becomes much less profitable because retailers know you can always buy at costmitigated prices In short the PJM model is not market It is just an alternative form of regulation that is politically attractive because it reduces price volatility but it is not good for consumers or traders because they just get a higher cost form of regulation than traditional costofservice regulation You pay marketclearing prices to costofservice mitigated bids but under regulation you could just pay costofservice prices and eliminate the inframarginal profits to low cost generators As we discussed during our dinner I think the two biggest sources of benefits from restructuring will come from getting the demandside involved in the market and from more efficient risk management A necessary condition for both of these to occur is prices that reflect actual conditions in the market including the extent of market power exercised Masking these signals dulls any incentive for market participants to make the investment necessary to management The PJM model is just way to have a market in name without achieving any significant benefits to consumers or energy traders Frank
