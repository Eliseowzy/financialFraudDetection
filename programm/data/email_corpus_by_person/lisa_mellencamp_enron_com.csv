the Taliban WhyYo u invest Well keep scoreMoney does it all redi rmoneycentralredirectasppageidDedblockmoneyplannertargetDarticl escommonmoneyproasp The answer like everything associated with Enron is complex But the shor t version is that investors fear that hidden problems will scotch the merge r and force Enron to seek bankruptcy protection potentially leaving its sh ares worth pennies While attention has so far focused on credit problems related to illdisclo sed limited partnerships institutional investors are increasingly worried about risks Enron faces in the market for financial derivatives known as s waps Accentuating their concern Billions of dollars worth of Enrons ne arterm swap contracts instruments that ironically were invented to help corporations limit risk will reportedly mature next month and are even more hidden from investors view than the deals that have gotten the firm i nto trouble so far On Wednesday afternoon the bondrating agency Fitch up dated its opinion on Enron by stating it believed there have been signific ant cash collateral calls from wholesale trading customers well in excess o f previous expectations Glenn Reynolds chief executive of independent debtresearch firm CreditSig hts and a former chief credit officer at Lehman Bros said the swaps marke t is a very large but arcane investment arena that isnt followed by mainst ream corporate bond analysts or equity analysts Yet he noted its one o f the biggest things that can still go badly wrong for Enron How much is Enron on the hook for Swaps exposure thus makes December a makeorbreak month for the company a s its counterparties in complex deals glued together with billions in borro wed funds frantically attempt to unwind positions in markets as disparate a s currency natural gas bonds and metals If Enron either made the wrong b ets on too many of these deals or contract covenants are breached that spu r demands for hardasset or cash collateral the company could be forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy court to prevent a run on its dwindling treasury Moreover because the world of swaps and derivatives is so incestuous wi th Company A able to pay its hundreds of millions in derivatives obligation s to Company B only after it receives payments from Company C some trader s worry that Enrons potential inability to pay off on its swaps liabilitie s could threaten the stability of the worlds commoditytrading system No one is saying that this worstcase scenario is bound to happen But rumo rs of default risk can spread like financial smallpox in nervous markets even if theyre never proved true One story making the rounds on trading floors for instance tied the historic collapse of US government bonds i n the third week of November to the belief that Enron had to sell vast quan tities of shortterm Treasury notes to make good on swaprelated margin cal ls Enron officials did not return calls for comment Experts noted that Enrons counterparty risks and scant disclosure on high levels of borrowing remind them of the spectacular blowup of hedge fund Lon gTerm Capital Management in which imperiled the world capital market s until the Federal Reserve captained a bailout That debacle ended when on cegenerous banks and brokerages finally turned off the money spigot Said one veteran portfolio manager who asked not to be identified This is sha ping up to be LTCM If Enrons lines of credit dry up theyre out of bus iness end of story Lots of credit and lots of deals To understand the problem more clearly its important to understand what En ron does for a living and the role and utility of swaps Many investors think of Enron as an energy company or gas utility but it h as really operated more like a combination investment bank market maker an d hedge fund in the past few years One of the key ways it earned income wa s its role in selling riskmanagement instruments those swaps as a so lution for whatever financial impairments that a company fretted over Lets say you run the riskmanagement operation of a metalmining firm and youre long copper futures as a hedge against the possibility that prices m ight fall in six months You want to lock in the price so you enter into a swap with Enron under rules of the International Swap Dealers Agreement o r ISDA Accounting protocols allow you to keep this trade off your balance sheet so its not disclosed anywhere for competitors or investors to mon itor One of Enrons roles was to find a company with the opposite problem to yours lets say they want to be short copper futures and make the match Thus Enron helped you swap a risk that made you uncomfortable for a risk that you felt you could control More often Enron reportedly took the swap itself and laid off the risk by using some other hedge such as being long or short Eurodollars or US Tre asury notes It might also find it profitable to be the one responsible for actually delivering the physical product At its peak Enron is said to ha ve been a counterparty on thousands of swaps per week This business requires massive amounts of credit also known as leverage because margins are slim the only way to become supersuccessful is t o do really big volume It turned out that few of LongTerm Credit Manageme nts counterparties or bank lenders understood that the hedge fund had leve raged itself by as much as because of similar efforts to trade in high volume And likewise one veteran analyst who asked not to be identified t old me that he believes Enron might have been leveraged by as much as an as tronomical in some cases Thomas Seims chief economist at the Federal Reserve in Dallas and an autho rity on swaps told me that the crux of the issue is Do we know exactly w hat their positions are and did they use swaps and leverage properly or improperly When we find out we can determine the potential for a contagio n effect The big question How many deals Why dont we know what their positions are Legally theyre not required t o reveal them and we already know that Enron has done an absolutely terr ible job of disclosing information that securities laws and investment comm unity conventions actually require Swaps are similar to the proprietary tr ading operation of major brokerages but with one critical difference Typi cally stocks are fairly liquid and transaction terms do not vary much But swap contracts can have all sorts of covenants related to the creditworthin ess of the counterparties So for all anyone outside of Houston knows ther e could be any number of billiondollar deals hanging out there with rules that require Enron to put up collateral or pay off loans if their debt rati ng falls below a certain rating threshold such as BBB one step above jun k The surprise disclosure of such a clause in a previously hidden limited partnership contract over a Brazilian deal is what caused Enrons stock to plunge on Tuesday according to traders More importantly one financial services executive pointed out because Enr on owns the market for many swaps spread options and other thinly traded f inancial instruments theyre the ones who set the marktomarket price tha t shows on their profitandloss statement For example every night an Enr on trader must mark the value of a year Chicago naturalgas swap on his books There is no closing or settlement price theres only what the Enr on trader thinks the price should be It is in these marktomarket prices of thousands of swap positions that Enron could theoretically hide hundreds of millions in unrealized losses if it chose to One prominent New York consultant to the energy riskmanagement industry to ld me hes estimated that Enron could be forced to write off as much bil lion or more in failures related to its swap transactions Why hasnt anyon e focused on it The magnitude of Enrons partnership problems is so great that after awhile you get numb and no one is paying attention to this par t of their operation Philip K Verleger Jr a leading energyindustry economist and consultant also noted that one reason that Enron risks arent easily quantified is th at they may not be price independent Thats an economists way of pointi ng out that the company a major player in a corner of the derivatives bu siness called delta hedging may not have the capital required to maint ain a futures position in all the puts or calls it sold to commodity produc ers trying to offset risks that the price of things like natural gas or oil might fall or rise sharply If prices maintain above or below a level that Enron forecast as likely to make it money in such a transaction no proble m But if prices in the commodity change unexpectedly as oil prices did earlier this month then Enron could find itself deep in the hole and for ced to lean on thinning lines of credit to pay its obligation Whirlwind merger deal no reassurance Verleger isnt mollified by the notion that Dynegy which agreed to merge w ith Enron has studied the companys trading book thoroughly and decided it was fine Dynegy probably was not able to see its whole book in a week he said Added another trader who declined to be identified How anyone c ould do such fast due diligence is beyond me completely Another trader sp eculated that auditors at Dynegy a much smaller firm may have initial ly given Enron a free pass on some disclosures because it was considered on e of the cleverest and bestconnected companies in the nation with a chief executive who was a major financial backer and friend of President George W Bush Reynolds the CreditSights executive said that investors should beware wha t he calls omission risk or the simple fact that what you dont see i s what gets you every time He points out for instance that Enron had a chance to tell investors about its ratingsrelated exposure in the Brazilia n deal during a conference call with investors last week but didnt It b oggles the mind that they have kicked away every opportunity to rebuild co nfidence and credibility he said So what if gremlins pop out of the swaps closet Reynolds believes that Dyn egy will use broadly written escape clauses in its merger agreement to walk away from its Enron merger if unexpected swap defaults called fails i n the business emerge He believes that Enron would then find it necessa ry to seek the protection of bankruptcy court because no other merger part ner or bank is likely to follow in Dynegys footsteps to the altar In that event Reynolds estimates Enrons stock which traded for a y ear ago could quickly sink to

RELEASESeptember CONTACT PGE News Department PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PGE CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI ZATION Plan Pays Claims in Full Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State Bailout San Francisco CA PGE Corporation NYSE PCG and its utility unit Paci fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in US Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter bankruptcy p roceedings The official creditors committee supports the plan This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company to move out of Chapter as a financially strong business posi tioned to continue safe reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr icity to its customers pay all valid creditor claims in full and do so wi thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout said Robert D Glynn Jr Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman CEO and Pr esident of PGE Corporation And the plan will enable us to provide long term growth prospects to shareholders The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation into two separate standalone companies no longer affiliated with one anot her The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste m The electric generation electric transmission and natural gas transmi ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p art of PGE Corporation The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a nd Electric will be distributed to PGE Corporation shareholders The electric generation electric transmission and gas transmission operati ons when reorganized as new businesses under PGE Corporation will have t he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors claims The plan also re structures certain existing debt and uses billion in cash on hand to s atisfy creditor claims Under the plan all valid creditor claims will be paid in full using a com bination of cash and longterm notes In total the plan will provide cred itors with about billion in cash and billion in notes The vast m ajority of creditorsthose with allowed claims of or lesswill rec eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec tive date of the plan Most secured creditors will also receive percen t of their allowed claims in cash Finally unsecured creditors with allow ed claims in excess of the threshold will be paid percent in ca sh and percent in notes Following the restructuring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PGE Corporation will be organized as follows Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i ts customers in Northern and Central California It will hold percent o f the current utility assets in terms of book value and will employ people Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu ll range of utility services to one out of every Americans PGE Corporation in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus iness will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri c generation electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company The new electric generation business will be a California company establish ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a ssociated lands and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district s now held by the utility In total the unit will have approximately megawatts of generation The facilities will be operated in accordance with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and in ke eping with sound environmental stewardship policies The generating busine ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com pany under a year contract at a stable marketbased rate The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u tility The system comprises circuit miles of electric transmission lines and cables The new gas transmission business will be a California company established to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b y the utility including miles of transmission pipelines and three ga s storage facilities Following the reorganization the California Public Utilities Commission wi ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company i ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates The Federal Energy Regulat ory Commission FERC will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses for the hydroelectric assets and the rates terms and conditions of servic e provided by the electric transmission business FERC will also assume ju risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant and over the rates terms and conditions of service for the ga s transmission system which will become an interstate pipeline Glynn said This plan without raising retail rates provides a safe reli able and longterm electric supply to California customers It enables our company to maintain a qualified workforce And it enables us to keep our generating assets intact and integrated rather than selling them piecemeal to pay creditors The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga nization We envision essentially the same experienced dedicated team continuing to do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs said Glynn We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t he people who know how to run them best In addition to resolving creditors claims and maintaining stability for cu stomers and employees the plan also provides longterm benefits to the sta te It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power for customers by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect ric Company would be financially able to reassume the procurement responsi bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R esources The Chapter process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented Paul Aronzon legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito rs said This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r esolve creditors claims and restore PGEs creditworthiness It has our f ull support and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte r process With this plan filed said Glynn we are now focused on bringing the Cha pter process to completion reaffirming the financial health and creditw orthiness of our operations through this reorganization restoring customer s confidence and rebuilding value for our shareholders At AM Pacific Time today PGE Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electr ic Company will discuss the plan of reorganization on a conference call for members of the media The dialin number for the call is or Passcode At AM Pacific Time today PGE

Utility These statements are necessarily subjec t to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to dif fer materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements Although PGE Corporation and the Utility are not able to predict all of th e factors that may affect whether the Plan will be confirmed or whether i f confirmed it will become effective some of the factors that could affec t the outcome materially include the pace of the Bankruptcy Court proceedi ngs the extent to which the Plan is amended or modified legislative and r egulatory initiatives regarding deregulation and restructuring of the elect ric and natural gas industries in the United States particularly in Califo rnia whether the Utility is able to obtain timely regulatory approvals or whether the Utility is able to obtain regulatory approvals at all risks re lating to the issuance of new debt securities by each of the disaggregated entities including higher interest rates than are assumed in the financial projections which could affect the amount of cash raised to satisfy allowe d claims and the inability to successfully market the debt securities due to among other reasons an adverse change in market conditions or in the c ondition of the disaggregated entities before completion of the offerings whether the Bankruptcy Court exercises its authority to preempt relevant n onbankruptcy law and if so whether and the extent to which such assertion of jurisdiction is successfully challenged whether a favorable tax ruling or opinion is obtained regarding the taxfree nature of the internal restr ucturings and spin off contemplated by the Plan and the ability of the Ut ility to successfully disaggregate its businesses Please visit our websites wwwpgecorpcom and wwwpgecom
