Van Pelt Chris mailto Sent November To Pickering Mark Subject FW Giga Proposal and Order Form Mark Below you will find Julies response to your initial questions I am looking forward to getting you and Julie on the phone to discuss the m ost recent updates and lay out some of the questions and issues you arewill be facing Regards Chris Original Message From Giera Julie Sent Tuesday November PM To Hurwitz Bonnie Van Pelt Chris Cc Nelson Gregory Cecere Marc Jette Susan Subject RE Giga Proposal and Order Form My rating of Big capability is Accenture Excellent with actual integration work especially surrounding applications in the financial arena manufacturing consumer products Les s experience with Oil and Gas but good skills with newer web applications Prefer to take entire portions of the projects themselves rather than wo rk collaboratively with customers Expensive Weaker on actual MA strateg ic work planning of an integration or leading an entire effort like this Again prefer to have control rather inflexible in their approach very dedicated to procedure and process which is good to an extentbut tends to spend way too much time with administrative tasks and creating reams of paper and meetings than getting anything done when they are managing an ef fort like this Better choice for actual integration work but should giv e them whole applications or departments like finance or distribution for example Not good with applications that require a lot of interface with other project teams and multiple business units Does not play well with others so carve up chunks of the effort they can do on their own and you w ill get good results Lots of MA integration experience as a result of th eir close relationships in the banking industry and consolidation that has been prevalent there over last years PWC Very strong overall MA strategy Great documentation of business pr ocesses for multiple vertical industries which can be very helpful in manag ing projects like this Project Management tools are strong as is collabo ration with other project teams or other business units particular streng ths in integration work in financial services manufacturing telecomm esp ecially with applications like SAP and supply chain Price wise middle of the pack Good choice for either role but would recommend PWC serve eith er as project manager OR as integrator not as both Would stretch them to o thin with companies your size and complexity I think Deloitte My favorite for MA leadership and integration work Solid pric ing great business process documentation through templates they have creat ed Very collaborative works well with others Solid project mangement Experience with MA for about years multiple projects and initiatives Good value for the money Particular strengths with CRM Supply chain ERP SAP and Peoplesoft Vertical industry expertise in oil and gasmanuf financial services telecomm industries Good value for moneybut will al so work to ensure that knowledge transfer occurs so that internal IT perso nnel learn as much as they can Very customer friendly Good choice for e ither component project management of entire merger due to deep knowledg e on process and knowledge data bases also very strong integration practic e If I had to choose I would choose Deloitte to manage the project KPMG Weakest of all the companies in both project management and integrat ion work Has not had a lot of experience with MA leadership does not ha ve the strength of documented tools and business processes of the others Actual integration work would be ok especially surrounding SAP JDEdwards Manugistics Project Management is ok but there are better choices in th e others right now KPMG is undergoing tremendous stresses internally righ t now their European operation is really a loose federation of companies w ho are independantly owned The European portions are attempting to sell t hemselves to KPMG competitors so internal politics detract from the abilit y of this company to focus on a large integration effort that may span months Pricing is highly variable depending upon business unit Cap GeminiEY The old EY had an excellent MA practice that had years o f experience with actually constructing deals managing efforts and doing integration work Cap Gemini has some experience with actual integration o f companies as they have been involved in key mergers in Europe and have d one some pretty impressive work with large complex integration efforts C ap Gemini presence still very very weak in the US EY personnel are still in the majority however the EY personnel in the US are mainly in the ma nagement consultancy area very few of the actual integration programmers r emain here most of that work is being done by the Cap Gemini side of the house in Europe Cap Gemini and EY have done an impressive job with their own merger one of the better run efforts in recent years so from that pe rspective they would be an interesting choice Tools and methodology for p roject management are strong integration work in US has been weakened a bi t since the majority of this work has been passed over to Cap and Caps st rength resides in Europe Pricing is midrange good value for dollar Ex perience with the major ERP and CRM apps less experience with supply chain and buying exchanges Would be a good choice for project management and if integration work were to have a major European component would be a goo d choice for that portion of a project like this Bottom Line Best Choices for Project Management in order of preference Deloitte Consulting PWC CGEY Accenture KPMG Best Choices for integration work AccentureDeloitte PWC CGEY higher in preference if big European component KPMG Warning with Accenture D oes not play well with others and does not collaborate well with clients If however Enron prefers to have a company completely manage the merger and does not wish to be involved quite a bit in this effort then Accentur e is a very solid choice Best Regards Julie Original Message From Van Pelt Chris Sent Tuesday November AM To Giera Julie Cc Nelson Gregory Cecere Marc Inquiry Subject FW Giga Proposal and Order Form
