Newsletter Embedded image moved to file picpcx BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Global Markets Coal and Emissions Trading The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coalsynfuel spread The coal cash book which began trading only two months ago has traded over million spot tons The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal Enron Energy and Operational Services ENA Solid Fuel Initiative ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words Enron and coal in the same sentence consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG Dense Natural Gas however we went with Solid Fuel Initiative This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit The primary areas are Texas Florida southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area There are principal areas currently being aggressively pursued Brownsville TX and Brighton FL In Brownsville the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay A MW facility is being considered for Brownsville As conceptualized it will consist of two MW net CFB units Circulating Fluidized Bed Boilers The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke petcoke and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity As stated the plant is initially MW but will be designed to be expanded to a MW facility The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin Cheryl Kent Project Admin Assistants Bill Fox as PEM and Paula Solomon as PCM As the project develops there will be more team members required In addition as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team eSource eSource Enrons research group recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst
