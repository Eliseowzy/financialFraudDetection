the CAISO because of power supply situations Rotating outage plans are then required to be implemented by the Utilities in order to reduce their power supply requirements ie electric loads The utilities chose to implement their Rotating Outage Plans by dropping various distribution circuits that do not have essential customers connected to them on a rotating basis because it is cheap and easy to implement less controversial and less politically sensitive The following are my comments My main concern is with regards to the way they propose to handle Direct Access customers Direct Access customers should not be included in PGEs Mandatory Curtailment Plan MCP because the power that these customers are using is not coming from PGE anymore Their power supply requirements are being met by their ESPs PGEs proposal is treating transmission level customers like utilities The only difference this time is that PGE is acting like the regulator controlling the customer At a minimum the cost of implementing their proposal should be paid for by PGE and not the transmission customers Nonfirm customers such as IBM should not be included or be required to participate in their MCP anymore because their loads are dropped down to the minimum or essential levels by the CAISO first even before a state of emergency is declared There is a minimum load level that facilities require in order to maintain human and environmental safety conditions Please give me a call if you have any question Thanks Forwarded by Jess GaluraHOUEES on AM John Wack AM To Jess ES cc Jeff xchange Jeff nron Roger
