fun to have all day Saturday and Im really not worried about leaving you a key under the door mat or waking up to greet you we can work it out Whenever you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me too Im not doing much to help you make a decision I know but I want you to do whatever is easiest and most comfortable for you I remember you having to get up at the crack of smack to come out here on Saturday sometimes its easiest to stay up later rather than getting up earlier I have virtually no plans that weekend now so Ill start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekendWe should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter too since we didnt get to do that last time Well plan on Saturday evening for that Ill gather some friends Hope youre having a good day Julie At PM you wrote Okay so heres the debateTheres a flight out Friday night leaving Houston at pm and getting into SD around in the morning The next earlier flight leaves Houston around pm but unfortunately theres no way I could make that one because of work The other option is to fly in Saturday morning like I did last time Im leaning towards leaving Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you dont mind waking up to let me in That way wed have all day Saturday to do things and I wouldnt leave on Sunday until around or I could even leave around Anyway I was just wondering what you think

Subject We have closure well sortof Im soooo good The chosen path was cool indifference So last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing I got there about with Nick and the groups size swelled to about by About I saw Kevin Teds pal the one you meet a steak night wandering around LWs obviously in search of someone Can you believe it He Ted knew I had organized this gathering I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Teds attendance mind you Ted was not in the email distribution and he had the nerve to come Anyway Kevin saw me and came over to chat He informed me that our friend Ted should be there shortly to which I responded You would know better than me at this point The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms bad terms etc I said there really werent any terms I just hadnt heard a peep out of him for about weeks Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Teds head and cause a big scene When I said no I think he was genuinely disappointed I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the loss and that while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more with each passing day the loss seems less and less like much of a loss Kevin told me I was betteroff without Ted To go even further he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his girlfriends He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy ie fun to be around good stories etc he wasnt good dating material I agreed with Kevin saying Ted is a great guy he just makes a lousy man dont you like that one I then went on to say Anyway Im destined for bigger and better things right Kevin Much bigger and much better About this time my parents showed upthe plot thickens I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dumdadumdum Ted shows up He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eyecontact with me I give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant hows it going He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about I told him the Navy he said dont get Kevin started or youll never shut him upThen he walked away He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join Ted My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished It really was a great night I would almost say I was glowing I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasnt a show for Teds benefitI really was having a great time So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to TedKevins table to say goodbye to Kevin It was awesome Teds sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldnt even make eyecontact I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House Needless to say I was very hung over today Anyway theres the storyHes a complete and utter asshole So Im done And no there is no way he could

bigger and better things right Kevin Much bigger and much better About this time my parents showed upthe plot thickens I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when dumdadumdum Ted shows up He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eyecontact with me I give him a hey and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant hows it going He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about I told him the Navy he said dont get Kevin started or youll never shut him upThen he walked away He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with my group for quite a while before going to join Ted My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished It really was a great night I would almost say I was glowing I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasnt a show for Teds benefitI really was having a great time So when my parents decide to head out they walked over to TedKevins table to say goodbye to Kevin It was awesome Teds sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents he couldnt even make eyecontact I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House Needless to say I was very hung over today Anyway theres the storyHes a complete and utter asshole So Im done And no there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces Now on to a fun subject my trip to London I bought my ticket today I think I got hosed a little bit but it was the cheapest ticket I could find before taxes I will arrive at Heathrow airport around am Friday the th and depart about am on Tuesday the th Im very excited about the trip I really need to get out of Houston I leave the activities in your capable hands bear in mind I will have to see Darren and Nick at some point Single again Sue

to have all day Saturday and Im really not worried about leaving you a key under the door mat or waking up to greet you we can work it out Whenever you want to leave on Sunday is fine with me too Im not doing much to help you make a decision I know but I want you to do whatever is easiest and most comfortable for you I remember you having to get up at the crack of smack to come out here on Saturday sometimes its easiest to stay up later rather than getting up earlier I have virtually no plans that weekend now so Ill start thinking about what fun events are occurring that weekendWe should go out downtown to the Gaslamp quarter too since we didnt get to do that last time Well plan on Saturday evening for that Ill gather some friends Hope youre having a good day Julie At PM you wrote Okay so heres the debateTheres a flight out Friday night leaving Houston at pm and getting into SD around in the morning The next earlier flight leaves Houston around pm but unfortunately theres no way I could make that one because of work The other option is to fly in Saturday morning like I did last time Im leaning towards leaving Friday night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you dont mind waking up to let me in That way wed have all day Saturday to do things and I wouldnt leave on Sunday until around or I could even leave around Anyway I was just wondering what you think about the various options Let me know and Ill try and book this thing today Susan Embedded Enron Capital Trade Resources Corp image moved to file From Julie Gibson picpcx AM To Susan M Scott cc
