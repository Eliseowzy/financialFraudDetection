london group cannot trade on behalf of ENA I understand that the First Union trade was done as they had an agreement in place with ENA but not Com Bearing in mind that London traders have transacted on behalf of ENA I expect that we should BTB these trades with Com PaulDenis If so I suggest going forward that where we have to do a trade for ENA we get Mozam to do it with Markus approval as he is based in Houston Assuming that we get the service agreement in place we can do the risk mgmt from London If we do it like this then all other issues go away with the exception of service agreements which need to be put in place I do not believe that it is correct to say that there is only one book Paul We currently have one businesstwo books one in london one in houston Each trade is booked against a specific book Bryan is quite happy to have risk reside in each book assuming legaltaxregulatory compliance There is NO other reason for BTB that I am aware of All risk managment takes place here However we will not be able to pay out of ENA accounts and will have to request them to do so It is quite clear that we have the necessary understanding of the issues to resolve so lets get this done ASAP Bryan can you ask Mary to arrange a meeting for ThursFri Paul do you wish to conference in Houston on this Regards Dave Janine Juggins To Paul CT cc Denis O CT Bryan CT Elaine Bannerman CT David A WallRisk CT Mark CT Erica CT Mahesh CT Subject Re ENA Enron Creditcom The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided by the Tax group London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron Creditcom Ltd not ENA Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA not Enron Creditcom Ltd Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Creditcom Ltd will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be laying off positions acquired by Enron Creditcom Ltd If ENA is simply laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the back to back Assuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Creditcom Ltd an agreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for their activity and risk assumed Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh Lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the future and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service agreementsfee arrangements in place Regards Janine Paul Simons To Denis O CT cc Bryan CT Elaine Bannerman CT David A WallRisk CT Mark CT Janine CT Subject Re ENA Enron Creditcom I agree with Denis remarks especially about there being a single book and hence the need for matching terms and backtoback trades From a regulatory perspective you dont want to book ENAs trades in London since it is not authorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT our SFA regulated entity Hope this helps Paul Denis OConnell To Bryan CT cc Elaine Bannerman CT David A WallRisk CT Paul CT Mark CT Janine CT Subject Re ENA Enron Creditcom As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston As far as I am aware there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or EnronCreditcom in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in Houston From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate trading book should be mainatined by ENA It may be acceptable for EnronCreditcom to risk manage ENAs credit derivaties postions provided the requisite service agreement has been put in place this is really a question for ENA Mark I do not know if such a service agreement is in place Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not btbacked with Com the market risk will reside with ENA a btb with Com would be necessary to consolidate the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in Com In view of the fact that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book all credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than EnronCreditcom should be backtobacked with Com In situations where ENA has sold protection and Com has bought protection on the same name this internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to Com which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection from As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms regardless of the Enron booking entity Mark Paul can you add further clarification as to the position particularly where I havent hit the mark tks Denis Bryan Seyfried To Elaine Bannerman CT cc Denis O CT David A WallRisk CT Subject Re ENA Enron Creditcom In reality I think of there being a single global book and terms should match across internal legal entities The only reason for booking into two separate entities is for Tax andor regulatory reasons The risk is managed out of London I dont think there is any reason to backtoback trades into EnronCreditcom but will defer to the appropriate tax legal and control personnel I dont think a services agreement has been set up yet We should try to close the open issues next week Could you coordinate the relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results thanks Elaine BannermanSowah To Bryan CT cc Denis O CT Subject ENA Enron Creditcom Bryan Please could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA can be booked in London riskmanaged in London do not have to be backtobacked with Enron Creditcom there is a Service Agreement between the two entities My understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of transactions for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Creditcom has bought protection on the same name We would only need to match the terms where protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name Your response will be greatly appreciated Thanks Elaine
