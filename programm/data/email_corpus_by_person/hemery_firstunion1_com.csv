EVNxtFY LT EPS Cur Nxt Cur Nxt EBITDA Growth ENE FY X X X X NA PERCEPTIONS TOWARD ENRON HAVE TUMBLED FAR BELOW REALITY Perceptions toward Enron have fallen as dramatically over the past months as we have seen for any major company However the major disconnect is that unlike many technology and other former high growth companies Enron continues in our view to be the farandaway bestinclass company in its major business segments and to have companymaking growth prospects with a high probability of success in huge new markets Only months ago Enron was perceived as a company that could do no wrong Its wholesale marketing operation currently of earnings was viewed as having virtually limitless potential and its retail marketing business was just beginning to emerge as a business that could even surpass wholesale Management presented its telecommunication strategy to Wall Street in January to great fanfare It was this raising of expectations to in hindsight unreasonable levels and managements failure to reset expectations for telecommunications when this business clearly was falling far short of the objectives set by management that set the stage for investors to lose trust in management and to discount other statements because disclosure and transparency of information was so limited PERCEPTIONS HAVE HIT BOTTOM AND ARE LIKELY TO TURN WITH COMING DISCLOSURES We believe perceptions have gone to such a negative extreme that a major uptick is likely in the near and intermediate term given actions we expect to be taken by management and new disclosures we expect with the Q report and at year end We are decreasing our previous price target from to still representing appreciation based on an multiple of forward earnings we see this target as one that could easily be exceeded We view the current period as an extremely rare opportunity to purchase shares of a company that remains extremely well positioned to grow at a substantial rate and earn strong returns in the still very young and evolving energy convergence space We do not intend to totally dismiss the concerns of investors and even certain of the negative stories that are circulating about Enron Some appear to have validity However most appear to us to represent major exaggeration or misinformation to an extreme even these are difficult to effectively debunk given Enrons limited financial disclosure WE SPOKE RECENTLY WITH MOST OF TOP MANAGEMENT OUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS HIGH We spoke recently with top management including the CEO CFO Chief Accounting Officer and the head of Wholesale Services We challenged top management on the wide range of accusations and concerns that have been repeatedly bandied around by investors and have weighed heavily on the shares We are convinced that the great bulk of the negative stories being told about Enron are false or without substantial merit Most others appear exaggerated in their claims We strongly believe that ENE shares have fallen to discount these worst fears of investors and that as they are debunked in coming months as we fully expect that the shares will rise substantially We will review the major concerns that investors have expressed and present our responseconclusions Market Speculation Enron uses fair value accounting and has created the bulk of its earnings in recent years by writing up assets to market and above market in todays world and now faces huge charges as it attempts to sell these assets Response Enron does use fair value accounting but only in its merchant investment portfolio This portfolio totaled as much as billion at its peak and is currently valued at approximately billion Earnings and losses from this portfolio have appeared in the asset and investment category of Wholesale Services the by far smallest piece of Wholesales earnings in recent years Any net gains in our view have been a modest portion of earnings over the years and a negative in This criticism of Enrons past earnings which some have used to discount past and current levels of earnings as proper numbers to use to value the company appears to be totally off base We believe that some small portion of past earnings can be categorized by investors as nonrecurring but that the great bulk of past earnings are real and recurring and the proper starting point in forecasting future earnings Market Speculation Enron has indicated that many billions of dollars of assets that earn low returns are for sale and investors are concerned about major writeoffs that some believe could run in the billions of dollars Response Management does not deny that certain assets when sold could incur losses However others are likely to be sold at gains No assets on the balance sheet are classified by accountants as impaired which would require that writeoffs be taken Rumors of an million charge at the companys Dabhol India power project appear far off base and we expect Enron to suffer no loss given its strong contract position Although certain Brazilian assets could be sold at losses Enron does not have the problem of having financed the Brazilian assets with US debt all were financed with local currency We doubt that major charges are likely on any assets to be sold and expect management will better define this issue on October th with its earnings release Concerns of multibillion dollar charges in telecommunications and elsewhere also appear grossly inaccurate The sale of various assets including the long awaited sale of Portland General will likely create substantial cash proceeds close to billion of net cash proceeds from the PGN sale alone which will be accretive to earnings almost regardless of how the proceeds are used we expect debt paydown and share repurchases Enron is committed to selling some billion of dollars of assets over the next two years Market Speculation Capital requirements are substantial in the companys marketing operations and both customers and competitors are concerned about credit exposure to Enron Response Moodys upgraded Enrons credit earlier this year to BAA and rating agency discussions have been routine according to management given Enrons best ever funds flow ratios Management indicated that speculation of certain counterparties not extending credit are absolutely false Market Speculation Cash flow from operations has lagged earnings and the company has been a consumer of cash Response Management indicates that it will be cash positive in the second half of and in future years This is perhaps the most difficult or inpossible claim to confirm Management claims that margin activity distorted cash flow in H in there was billion of customer inflows to cover margin requirements and in H billion of deposits were returned Enron has made many billion of dollars of investment in past years as it sought to build its various businesses Financial discipline did not appear in the past to be a top priority as the company spent whatever it took to rapidly build its industry leading capabilities It now appears that financial discipline is dramatically improved at Enron Market Speculation A California generated huge profits for Enron B California represents substantial potential liabilities Response This is another difficult topic to prove or disprove Detractors can and have made many unsubstantiated claims The recent agreement for SoCalEdison to avoid bankruptcy appears to confirm the validity of contracts and likelihood of Enron being paid for past power sales Enron earlier identified nearly million of receivables and has indicated similar to other convergence companies that it has recognized limited profits in California and has created substantial reserves Market Speculation Disclosure is sketchy The company must be hiding something Response Enron had substantially more complete disclosure a decade ago when it was forming its natural gas business and found that competition intensified and margins were held down as competitors took advantage of the information Management has steadily reduced the disclosure of information even as the companys businesses and its products have become dramatically more complex Investors have begun to call Enrons earnings a black box as they began to doubt their ability to analyze and predict future earnings When management began to lose credibility with investors this turned into a total loss in confidence in reported and potential future results a very high price to be paid Enron management is now committed to improving disclosure even at the expense of competitive issues The number of true competitors has already declined dramatically We expect some additional disclosure with the Q report but substantially more beginning at yearend as management now recognizes the cost in ENE share price of the limited disclosure and loss of confidence Market Speculation Recent K and Q disclosure of transactions may require substantial new share issuance given the current weak share price that will appear in fully diluted shares Response These shares represent collateral to backstop offbalance transactions Net exposure and the transactions themselves are not well defined and disclosed Management has indicated to us that the company is working to restructure these transactions and that investors will see results on this score fairly soon continued First Call Corporation a Thomson

CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION Equity Research Americas Energy Curt Launer Philip Salles Andy DeVries Natural Gas Power Catalysts In Place EPG Up ENE Poised to Recover Group Positioning Solid Summary Group led by El Paso EPG Strong Buy up on positive meetings discussion of regulatory risks and increase in hedged production Storage revision moves Sept natural gas price down and EP shares lower IPPs rise in recovery from recent weakness Natural Gas Power majors up nearly vs rise in SP EPG gain plus upside moves in Dynegy DYN Buy and Williams WMB Buy Kinder Morgan KMI Strong Buy up for week and ytd as best performer in group Duke DUK Strong Buy up Enron ENE Strong Buy off for week At x eps est of and x est of ENE is trading at average pe of group and less than overall market Premium growth rate above dissipation of recent concerns positive group and company fundamentals point to recovery Cheap growth aspect of sector valuations identified in discount to SP pe despite premium growth rate Catalysts in Q eps up despite lower yroveryr commodity prices stable to higher sequential commodity prices and some improvement in regulatory environment Viewpoint Despite a significant drop of nearly in the September natural gas futures related to a storage reporting snafu that moved exploration and production shares lower the natural gas and power group led by a nearly gain in EPG rose about in line with the SP Stronger performance reversing declines by Independent Power Producers up last week helped DYN and WMB rise about each In terms of natural gas prices our focus remains on longer term supply and demand fundamentals that point to a sustainable range of per mcf We consider this range as beneficial for the merchant pipeline and producing sectors of the industry We have previously commented on the cheap growth attraction of the Natural Gas Power group compared to the overall market An earnings growth rate in excess of and a priceearnings multiple about below the SP currently are the valuation criteria that summarize this opportunity currently In our opinion the shares that best fit this investment model currently are EPG at x eps discussed below and WMB at x eps We also emphasize ENE at x because its premium pe is gone but its premium growth rate remains DYN at x eps and KMI at x are very attractive currently as well We look for Q eps growth above despite lower yearoveryear commodity prices stable to higher sequential natural gas and power prices and improvement in the regulatory environment as catalysts for recovery and upside for the group EPG Analyst Meeting Details Growth Regulatory Issues EPG held analyst meetings last week that focused on earnings growth especially in its Merchant Energy unit additional hedging of natural gas production and the regulatory and legal issues in the FERC market power and marketing affiliate abuse cases pending against the company In the two cases pending against EPG new information will be available soon Legal briefs were due Fri Aug and reply briefs are due on Sept Rulings by the FERC Administrative Law Judge ALJ are expected on or before Oct Initial comments from the EPG legal briefs substantiate the position that the company did nothing wrong has already been exonerated by the FERC in a March ruling on the affiliate matter and did not have or exercise market power We anticipate that the legal comments filed by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC will attempt to sensationalize EPG internal documents that discuss use of pipeline capacity to manipulate the market However this is only if these documents are taken out of context and without any recognition of the economic operational and regulatory realities of the situation In our opinion obvious and prejudicial comments by the ALJ indicate a probability of the affiliate case being ruled against EPG We regard the market power allegations as clearly unproved From a financial point of view the significance of this outcome is that the affiliate case carries no financial penalties and does not open EPG to civil liability in California In this event we would ascribe a possibility to settlement discussions emanating from the CPUC because they are seeking a financial windfall not a technical victory in their case against EPG From a business perspective EPGs Merchant Pipeline Production and Field Services units producing sustainable and visible eps growth in the range Our modeling concurs with these projections Our Merchant Energy estimate shows ebit growth mostly related to non commodity based fee and margin business In Production EPG has of production hedged at per mcf of hedged at per mcf and of at per mcf Our model shows EPGs leverage to natural gas prices of about per share per per mcf change At or above a realized gas prices indicates some conservatism in our estimates Our estimates remain in in We rate EPG Strong Buy and it is on the CSFB Focus List We recognize the regulatory issues with an interim target of x our estimate or as the October ALJ decision approaches Our longerterm target recognizing its premium growth rate is x eps or per share ATG Responds to Full Rate Review by PSC AGL Resources ATG Hold plans to ask the Georgia Public Service Commission PSC to reconsider its decision for a full rate review at its gas utility The PSC staff said that ATG is earning more than its allowed ROE of Approximately million pretax or per share aftertax is at stake in this matter ATG has responded that a rate reduction is unjust based on its calculation of a return A PSC ruling is expected in March We are maintaining our current estimates albeit with a higher level of uncertainty with the outcome of the rate case Our eps estimates are in and in Our valuation thesis for ATG points to its dividend yield of and a pe target of x eps Currently this derives a target price of and a Hold rating Please see report dated July for additional information AGA Revises Natural Gas

happens when the markets reopen As leaders work to prevent a political and psychological crisis from turning into a financial one hist ory offers the only real guide on what to expect when the smoke clears By Jon D Markman If you go way back it was years ago next week that Gen Robert E Lee and his Confederate troops engaged the Union Army at Antietam Md in a b attle that turned out to be the single bloodiest day in US history More than soldiers from both sides were killed or wounded on that Sept a figure that will probably be eclipsed by the carnage of Sept That attack the first major thrust north by the surprisingly po werful Southern rebels led President Abraham Lincoln to issue his Emancipa tion Proclamation and open a new chapter in American civil and business l ife a new era of liberty for people and markets Likewise have most major events in US economic history led to consequences unimagined by key acto rs at the time And so it will probably be with this attack Sources across the country told me Tuesday that they believe that the unexpected conseque nce over the next few days and months could be a stockmarket rally led fir st by promises by the Federal Reserve to provide all necessary funds to sta ggered banks and brokerages and next by vast deficit spending by Congress t o shore up the countrys defenses Michael Stutzer professor of finance a t the University of Iowa points out that Tuesdays events were a civil and emotional crisis not a financial crisis An emotional crisis he said ca n lead to a financial crisis only if mishandled by government authorities A financial crisis is what happened in Japan where people learned that no t only were all the stocks they held were overvalued but that their governm ent had a hand in leading their banks to bankruptcy he said Nothing lik e that is happening here But what does have to happen now is that the Fed must act to prevent a contagion of fear from spreading and leading people to withdraw money and stop buying things That would lead to a recession a nd thus to a real financial emergency A few predictions What are the likely immediate consequences when the US markets reopen later this week or next Anthony Kolton chief executive of Markethistorycom in Chicago has researched the past years of events that led the United States into war He forecasts with confidence that the major indexes will open with losses of then quickly recover by the end of the following trading week to remain unchanged at precatastrophe levels If there is a big opening plunge I think youll see a total recovery ov er the next five days he said from Manhattan Kolton who was en route to a meeting at the World Trade Center when the buildings were hit said he also believes that the United States does not face a financial crisis just because the buildings that were destroyed stood at the center of US fina ncial life The reason After the bombing of the buildings he says m ost companies spent millions to build disaster recovery systems and back up all their accounting far off site Were going to recover he said Ste ve Milner managing partner of the worldwide financial planning firm Squar Milner in Newport Beach Calif said he is most worried about the consumer not business Based on conversations with clients he believes that peopl e will react with fear and fearful people rein in their spending on ever ything from vacations to home remodeling and stocks That will be a real n ot an imagined economic event he believes that could badly damage a US economy that is already sputtering Milner also notes that many major fin ancial institutions that he does business with were already inclined to be sellers of the recent decline not buyers But that could turn around Peo ple who were inclined to sell might be more inclined to sell now but I do ubt it he said There is a cynical part of me that says financial profes sionals will realize that life goes on and will decide to be buyers Vic Niederhoffer a longtime trader for financier George Soros and his own acco unts says that he also believes that a big down market will find buyers I really hate to sound mercenary but I have received many messages from tr aders who say that they think this will be a terrific opportunity to buy W hether you look at the John F Kennedy assassination the Eisenhower heart attack the Warren G Harding ptomaine poisoning or airline crashes usuall y disasters provide the greatest times of opportunity he said Niederhof fer a student of economic history said that in the past disasters have le d to a tremendous boost for local and national economies as capital infrast ructure gets rebuilt with the most modern equipment Those two buildings al one will require massive outlays of funds possibly provided by the Fed or Congress from the US Treasury to build miles of new fiberoptic lines buy the latest datatransmission switches and possibly tens of thousands of new computers and software Everyone will chip in to help and this wil l turn out to be a transitory event Niederhoffer said It may cause a te mporary slowdown in the US economy and a big disruption in the supply cha in but there is no evidence that declines in products or earnings or comme rce have anything to do with stock prices anyway In fact there is no evid ence to suggest that stocks do any worse in recessions than they do in bett er times Mr P a hedge fund trader that I have quoted in past columns said he likewise believes that the first days move could set a bottom to t he market This is very bad for bonds very good for stocks he said Th is act of war with the magnitude of the loss of life will lead Congress t o engage in deficit spending like the world has never seen selling billi ons of dollars of new government bonds to cope both with the reconstruction of New York and the buildup of the American military Always history offers perspective So what if these scenarios dont pan ou t The global financial system was already in bad shape before Tuesday and sellers of stocks were swamping buyers with growing intensity If worried i nvestors decide to put all their personal funds in a lockbox and the Fed an d Congress stand aside you could look to the last major financial crises f or the floor in the market The October crash left the Nasdaq at at its nadir a level reached again four years later in October at th e moment of greatest panic over oil supplies during the Gulf War against Ir aq If the markets had risen from there in a straight line that approximate d the historic return of stocks that index would be at around today instead of That could be a real floor but its unlikely to trans pire if authorities do their job and thus avoid the fate that befell Gen G eorge McClellan two months after Antietam President Lincoln replaced him w ith Ambrose E Burnside after complaining about McClellans failure to pres s his advantage after victory His comment If you dont want to use the A rmy I should like to borrow it for awhile The Bush administration likewi se has a vast set of financial weapons at its disposal to battle this assau lt and the public will replace it if used unwisely and too slowly Top of
