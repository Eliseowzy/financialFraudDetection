been trading sideways for several weeks The sideways trading favors the bulls but they still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed higher at Same story Prices have leveled off the past four weeks after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low This does favor the bulls but not greatly Technically bulls still need to push prices above the resistance area My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes wont be dramatic but a slower grind higher with fits and starts First resistance is seen at First support is seen at LIVESTOCK June live cattle closed higher at today Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today and on news that boxed beef prices had improved Last week prices hit a fresh multimonth low Still prices are in an accelerating twomonthold downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have control Next support basis June is seen at First resistance comes in at the level August feeder cattle closed off cents today at The rally in the corn market today hurt feeders If recent history continues to play out in feeders prices may dip a bit more but the support area of will cap losses That is the lower level of the trading band in place for the past several weeks If prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the level Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at and then at June lean hogs closed higher at today Commercial buying was seen in the futures pits reports said Price action today saw more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present Next support lies at First resistance is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed cents higher at today Another mini weather scare popped prices today Two important things to point out here One July corn now the nearby contract did not stay below the key perbushel level very long Secondly notice how even some hot temps forecast for midMay popped prices higher I suspect that with prices this low going into the growing season this type of kneejerk reaction to any changes in the weather patterns will be the norm Still bottom pickers should beware Next resistance is now seen at Next support is seen at July soybeans closed cents higher at today Like corn beans were boosted by a mini weather scare and ideas that now there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans Importantly the bean market did not fare that badly technically last week in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures Todays big upside push propelled prices to a fresh fiveweek high and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at Bears still have the advantage Its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher First resistance is now seen at the area and then First support is now seen at July soybean meal closed up at today Prices today pushed to a fresh nearly threemonthhigh Importantly prices pushed above the congestion area on the daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid sign the lows are in place in the meal market Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Prices scored another new contract low today of cents Oil is still technically weaker than beans or meal right now But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed cents higher at today Hot and dry weather forecast for the US Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today Now odds have increased that a doublebottom reversal on the daily bar chart will be confirmed The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led to the stronger upside movement today Prices last Wednesday touched the contract low of Bears still have the slight edge but bulls are gaining confidence rapidly First resistance lies at the area Next support is seen at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today Prices scored a bearish outside day down on the daily bar chart today We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon Bulls can still correctly argue that todays pullback was just consolidation amid good prices gains seen recently A threemonth high was scored in July sugar just recently A sixweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at centstodays high First support is seen at cents July NY coffee closed cents lower at cents today Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of the bulls balloon They had gained momentum lately Not much technical damage will occur if prices can rebound but if good followthrough selling occurs Tuesday then odds significantly increase that prices will test the recent lows First support comes in at cents First resistance is seen at cents todays high July NY cocoa closed higher today at Prices scored a corrective inside day on the daily bar chart today following Fridays big sell off The bears wanted to see followthrough selling today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart but that did not occur Bulls and bears are still on a level playing field Next resistance comes in at First support is now seen at July cotton closed points higher at cents today Hot and dry weather in the cottongrowing regions of the US combined with a technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly higher today The cotton market will be like the grains Prices are so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially adverse weather patterns are forecast There was good followthrough buying today from Fridays outside day up on the daily bar chart and a key reversal up was confirmed This gives the bulls a bit more confidence Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be selling opportunities for the bears Lets see what happens this week My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next resistance lies at cents First support now is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should still beware July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Prices closed near the session high Last week bulls filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart They have gained confidence after the recent price action but will need to see more upside action this weekpushing prices above centsto gain solid momentum Next resistance is seen at cents Next support comes in at centstodays low July lumber futures closed the limit of higher again today at Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new forthemove high Bulls are really snorting now Expect more volatility as is typical for this market The next upside objective for the bulls is now the area and then First support is seen at the area This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines But the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong side of the lumber market METALS June COMEX gold closed up today at Prices corrected a bit more today after last Wednesdays strong gains that pushed prices to a twomonth high This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its earlyApril low Recent price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart Next resistance is located at the recent high First support is seen at July silver closed up today at an ounce Same story Silver prices are not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at Bears have the advantage July NY copper closed points lower today at cents A bearish US economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new contract low The stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed higher at today Bulls and bears are still at a standoff but bulls will gain the edge on a move above Expect more choppy trading Next support is seen at Next resistance lies at July heating oil closed points lower today at Bulls still have the slight edge Look for more choppy trading in the near future Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today After prices scored a new contract high last week they have sold off dramatically The increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market Bulls have lost their edge Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at July natural gas closed cents higher at today After prices hit a fresh fiveandonehalfmonth low last Wednesday weve seen corrective consolidation Bears still have the edge Next support is seen at and first resistance is at STOCKS FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points lower at today Prices pushed to another fresh fourweek low today Bears have the edge My bias is

today Bears are in control Bulls are hoping for some basing activity at lower levels and that may be occurring although its too early to tell Next support now lies at the level First resistance is seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points lower at Bears are in command Prices pushed to a fresh month low today and took out the midApril low of If we see followthrough selling to push prices significantly below todays low that a bearish signal and portends significantly more downside A monthold downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart and it has accelerated recently Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last Thursday and the bulls have the advantage as a six weekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Bulls are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high They still have the slight edge on a shortterm basis but they will lose it if they cant turn prices at least sideways this week This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points lower at Trading continues choppy at lower levels As prices approach the lower portion of the recent trading range strong support should kick in and provide for a bounce But if prices fall below the early April low of then the door is open to much steeper losses This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move below would be considered a bearish downside breakout Next support is now seen at the level Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Prices also pushed to a fresh fourweek high again today Next resistance lies at the level

which a decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon Shortterm indicators show the market is still overdone on the downside but nobody should stand in front of a steaming locomotive Longerterm charts do show good support at the even area First resistance is now seen at even or par The June US Tnote closed up nds today at Prices scored a corrective inside day after crashing to a fivemonth low Friday Bears have the edge now as severe technical damage has been inflicted

resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed firmer today Prices have leveled off the past week after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low Technically bulls

low First resistance comes in at the level August feeder cattle closed up cents today at Prices also posted a corrective rebound after the sharp losses Wednesday Recent history continues to play out

the session low amid a bearish USDA report released this morning The bearish report did put pressure on the market but not the strong pressure corn saw Traders have factored much of the bearish news into the soybean market Odds are lessening that a minor bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart Bears still have the solid advantage Fundamentally there is not much in the way of good news

wheat production figure today boosted HRW Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart but backed well off the highs by the close It will be important for bulls to show some followthrough strength on Friday Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions and bears still rule For bulls to get back in the ballgame they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart created last week by pushing prices to the area Thats a tall order right now Next resistance is seen at the level todays high Next support is seen at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points higher at cents today We now could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar on the daily bar chart This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains A threemonth high was scored in July sugar late

cents July NY coffee closed points higher at cents today Prices closed near the session high The bulls have gained momentum of late This recent upmove is the most significant showing by the bulls since midJanuary The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging for the bulls toogiven recent price history Still the bears could be setting a trap like they did

sharply today after rallying sharply Wednesday This should not surprise many Silver prices are still not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing

continues choppy at lower levels This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could argue that price action the past few

All Products Guaranteed E X T R E M E M A R K E T C O M M E N T A R Y June stock indexes close lower today Prices are basically trading sideways The Nasdaq June futures are still within striking distance of the April high of Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling fourweekold uptrend on the daily bar chart Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed lower Prices have also leveled off the past week after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low Technically bulls still need to push prices above the resistance area My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes wont be dramatic but a slower grind higher with fits and starts First resistance is seen at First support is seen at LIVESTOCK June live cattle closed lower at today Ouch Prices gapped sharply lower on the daily bar chart and hit a fresh eightmonth low today Reports that cash cattle traded lower today at some locations sent the futures market tumbling Todays plummet leaves the June futures well overextended technically on a shortterm basis A corrective bounce is in order The bears are in full control of the market Prices are trading way below an accelerating twomonthold downtrend line on the daily bar chart Next support basis June is seen at First resistance now comes in at the level August feeder cattle were pressured by the fat cattle futures and closed off cents today at Prices closed near the session low today and are now down in the lower portion of the recent trading range If recent history continues to play out the market will bounce up from the losses of the past two days But if prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range which is right at todays low of then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the level Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at June lean hogs closed lower today at Prices are still showing consolidation at lower levels after the sell off last week Firmer cash hog trade today could not stave off the technical weakness this market is experiencing The bears have the strong momentum on their side at present Next support lies at First resistance is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed unchanged at today It was a quiet inside day on the daily bar chart today ahead of Thursdays USDA supply and demand report and the weekly export sales figures Prices are under pressure this week after weekly crop progress reports out Monday showed very good planting progress in the US There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in the near term Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at the July soybeans closed cents lower at today Prices are consolidating the recent gains but bulls by no means have any significant momentum Still it does look like a minor bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart Fundamentally there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now Thursdays mornings USDA supply and demand report is expected to paint a picture that is not bullish for beans I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term This market is still in technical trouble and its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher First resistance is seen at the area and then First support is seen at and then at Several weeks ago I purchased a July soybean call option with a strike price of for a price of cents That option last traded at cents July soybean meal closed up at today Prices this week are showing consolidation after they pushed to a fresh eightweek high last Friday Recent price action is encouraging to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market Lets see what tomorrow mornings export sales report shows Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points lower at cents today After prices saw a decent corrective bounce Tuesday they sold right back off today This increase in volatility is consistent with a bottom process in a market Oil is technically much weaker than beans or meal right now But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at the contract low of cents July Chicago wheat closed cent lower at today Prices today touched the contract low of that was scored yesterday Rain in the Plains Makes Grain Thats a bearish refrain With the wheat crop behind schedule anyway the recent rains could allow the crop to make some good improvement Bears are in full command Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions First support lies at the contract low of Next resistance is seen at This market is shortterm oversold and I suspect well see a corrective bounce soon KC July HRW wheat closed off cent at today Again rainfall in the Plains states has weighed on the market for several sessions A VTop reversal is playing out on the daily bar chart Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions For bulls to get back in the ballgame they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart created last week by pushing prices to the area Thats a tall order right now Next resistance is seen at the area Next support is seen at This market is also shortterm overdone on the downside SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today We still could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar on the daily bar chart This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains A threemonth high was scored in July sugar late last week The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating fiveweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at cents First support is now seen at cents July NY coffee closed points cent lower at cents today Prices closed near the session low Still prices today matched the twomonth high set Tuesday before backing off a bit The bulls continue to gain momentum This recent move is the most significant showing by the bulls since midJanuary The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging for the bulls toogiven recent price history Still the bears could be setting a trap like they did in early January If bulls can push prices above cents and then see followthrough strength bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable First resistance comes in at cents First support is seen cents July NY cocoa closed lower today at Prices pushed to a fresh sixweek high today before selling off by the close and closing near the session low Tuesdays strong gaphigher trade on the daily bar chart did put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears Prices pushed above and negated a monthold downtrend line on the daily bar chart Next resistance comes in at todays high First support is now seen at July cotton closed point lower at cents today Traders took a rest day today after Tuesdays solid losses and ahead of Thursdays export sales and the monthly USDA supply and demand report Cotton is in a strong bear market and a new contract low was scored again today at cents Right now any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears But my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next support lies at cents First resistance is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should beware Bulls need to watch for some basing action which may be beginning July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Prices closed near the session high today and filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart Thats an important first step for the bulls in turning this market around Next resistance is seen at cents Next support comes in at centstodays low July lumber futures closed lower at today Todays sell off is not unhealthy for the bulls It was overdue Prices just Monday hit yet a new forthemove high at Todays price action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market Expect more volatility however as is typical for this market The next upside objective for the bulls is the area First support is seen at the area This market is still a bit shortterm overbought technically and I would not be surprised to more of a downside correction in the near term METALS June COMEX gold closed up today at Prices scored a big outside day up on the daily bar chart today and in the process pushed prices to a twomonth high Heavy fund short covering was featured in the trading pit This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its earlyApril low Todays type of gain is just what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart Next resistance is located at First support is seen at todays low July silver closed up today at an ounce Prices popped on short covering and the rally in gold Silver prices are still not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at todays low First resistance is seen at Bears still have the advantage July NY copper closed points lower today at cents More stock market weakness helped drive this market lower again today Prices may still be attempting to build a base and recover from the earlyApril low My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper But the stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed higher at today Prices scored a mildly bullish outside day up on the daily bar chart but bulls and bears are still at a standoff Expect more choppy trading Next support is seen at Next resistance lies at July heating oil closed points higher today at Prices closed near the session high and bulls still have the slight edge But look for more choppy trading in the near future Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents and then cents July unleaded gasoline closed points higher at today Prices closed near the session high and scored a bullish outside day up on the daily bar chart Prices scored a new contract high just Monday but backed off sharply before the close and then saw followthrough selling Tuesday That confirmed a key reversal But given the recent volatility in unleaded I am not placing a lot of emphasis on that key reversal Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears Toppickers beware Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at todays low July natural gas closed cents lower at today Prices hit a fresh fiveandonehalfmonth today Next support is seen at and first resistance is now at This market is still shortterm oversold technically FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points higher at today Bears have the edge as bulls have lost all the momentum they had gained in midApril Prices hit a fresh threeweek low today My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro Look for more choppy action in the near term Bulls will again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the area Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Bears are still in control Bulls are hoping for some basing activity at lower levels and that may be occurring although its too early to tell Next support now lies at the level First resistance is seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed unchanged today at Bears are in command Still my bias is that prices wont deteriorate much more Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points higher at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high late last week and are consolidating a bit this week The bulls still have the advantage as a fiveweekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart My bias is that the lows are in place First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points higher today at Prices rebounded today after Mondays key reversal down on the daily bar chart Bulls lost some the past two sessions but will gain it right back if prices can push back north soon Mondays key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago What it does suggest is a downside correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points lower at Trading continues choppy at lower levels This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move above the level would be considered a bullish upside breakout from the recent congestion area A move below would be considered a bearish downside breakout Next support is now seen at the leveltodays low Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points lower at today Bulls have the momentum in the near term The recent doubletop reversal on the daily bar chart still favors the bears longerterm Next resistance lies at the level First support is seen at the area My bias is still that a nearterm top is in place in the dollar index June US Tbonds closed higher today at Bulls need to show some more resolve after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late April A steep sixweekold downtrend line was penetrated on the upside last week and negated Also a minor doublebottom reversal has occurred on the daily bar chart My bias is that odds favor a strong upside move as opposed to a strong downside move Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at leveltodays low The June US Tnote closed up nds today at Bears still have the slight edge First support is seen at the level First resistance is seen at Daily Extreme Commentary is brought to

CHICAGO Dow JonesA reported jump in housing starts data Tuesday set the tone for gains in stock index futures for most of the session US housing starts rose for November to a seasonallyadjusted million annual rate This followed a revised fall in October to a million annual rate October starts were previously reported as sliding to a million annual rate The readings were much stronger than economists expectations That data added to an already positive tone present in equity Markets overnight thanks to encouraging news out of Circuit City and Best Buy Circuit City reported thirdquarter earnings at cents a share That was cents better than analysts had been expecting Circuit City stock jumped over a full point on that news before pulling back later in the session Best Buy posted cent third quarter earnings beating analysts expectations by one cent Chicago Mercantile Exchange stock index futures traders attributed a late morning dip in prices to some independent traders losing confidence that institutional players such as Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs which had been on the buy side early in the session would continue to support the market with their orders The downtick was further fueled when light sell stops were triggered under in the March Nasdaq futures contract However the contracts ended just about at the top of their day ranges Tuesday Analysts said continued

Gains Tuesday in a quiet session that stood in stark contrast with Mondays fireworks At pm EST the year Treasury note stood at up to yield The year Treasury gained to yielding The fiveyear price gained to a yield while the twoyear price was up at a yield of As it was on Monday the market was all about light flows and a lack of participation ahead of the Christmas holiday and yearend a condition that traditionally befalls the market this time of year I think the only thing in common between the two trading sessions is light flows said Michael Cloherty market strategist with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York Thats one of the things that pushed the market so far yesterday liquidity is pretty poor In battening down the hatches many dealers and investors are seeking to protect profits ahead of the yearend But theres also a sentiment that news on the economy is mixed right now and that thats limiting the participation of some market participants said The CRB INDEX exchangescindexes No report today ENERGY MARKETS exchangescenergy NEW YORK Dow JonesCrude oil futures ended steady and most gasoline futures contracts rose modestly Tuesday while heating oil futures posted moderate gains at the New York Mercantile Exchange Heating oil futures briefly surged nearly cents amid strength in the US East and Gulf Coast cash markets as refinery selling waned Upcoming colder weather in the Northeast the largest heating oil market in the country may have provided another boost We can only guess that it is some reaction to Monday afternoons National Weather Service shortterm outlooks showing belownormal temperatures for the Northeast in both the and day editions said Tim Evans analyst at IFR Pegasus Gasoline futures traded on middle ground as refiners are seen curbing gasoline production but demand is seen lackluster HOUSTON Dow JonesThe natural gas futures contract eased into the mids a million British thermal units Tuesday as another day of anticipated

MMBtu February fell cents to MMBtu Looking ahead expect that slow sinking feeling to continue well into Januarys expiration traders said CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies NEW YORK Dow JonesThe dollar tread water against the euro and edged only slightly higher against the yen Tuesday after some traders questioned whether the rally in the dollaryen and euroyen pairs over recent sessions may have been too much too soon Having jumped to a fresh threeyear high of Y during Asian trading the dollar slipped back as some market participants began to factor in the likelihood that the Bank of Japan wont implement any major new monetary initiatives at its twoday policy meeting that concludes Wednesday The euro slid as low as Y at one point well off its intraday high of Y Even so some analysts do expect some sort of policy change from the BOJ and many market watchers think the dollar is still set to move higher against the yen PRECIOUS METALS exchangescmetals NEW YORK Dow JonesPrecious metals settled mixed Tuesday with gold futures rallying on fund buying and gathering enough momentum to penetrate the key resistance area around an ounce and silver also flexed its technical muscle Lack of sellers into the gains helped the yellow metal accelerate upward breaking through and tripping buystops above there according to Refco Inc analyst Jim Steel The March silver contract on Comex also mustered the strength to break above resistance Tuesday finishing cents higher at an ounce No one still has any idea whats driving the rise in silver lease rates but Steel said he doubted people were borrowing just to sell into the recent strength as he hadnt seen evidence of selling on the longer end of the curve GRAINS exchangescgrains CHICAGO Dow JonesChicago Board of Trade corn and wheat futures settled lower Tuesday mostly on spillover pressure by the soybean market and on a late selloff by locals and speculators After a lackluster dull session corn and wheat futures sank to new session lows about minutes before the closing bell It was very slow in here until the last minutes said Victor Lespinasse a grain trader with AG Edwards in Chicago Corn and wheat came down in sympathy with beans SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains CHICAGO Dow JonesAfter a twosided dull session Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures closed lower Tuesday on a late technical selloff January soybean

Argentina could hurt the quality of the crop there Floor brokers said ADM bought between contracts of January soybeans and Cargill bought contracts Market watchers said commercials were the best scale down buyers in soybeans and oil Soy meal futures collapsed late in the session to post solid losses in sympathy with the weak soybean market and on widespread selling by the speculators Soy oil was the leader to the downside earlier in the session according to floor brokers The selloff started in the soy products which led to a general selloff said Victor Lespinasse a grain trader with AG Edwards LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock CHICAGO Dow JonesChicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures ended at or near limitup levels Tuesday as talk spread in the trading pit that Mother Natures winter wrath would soon be felt in some of the nations major cattle feeding areas The soontoexpire December contract ended up the perhundredweight limit hitting a nearly oneweek high The mostactively traded February contract surged to a twoweek peak while April climbed to a threeweek high Each contract finished cents below the limit price The bullish sentiment spilled over to feeder cattle futures which ended limitup in almost every contract Lean hog and pork belly futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ended mostly lower Tuesday in a lightvolume day as the market faced uncertainties over cash hog values for the remainder of the week The market had a relatively bearish tone at the open when the market failed Monday to move above a key resistance level of Sell stops were tripped in February below around Mondays low Another damping effect was Mondays low cattle kills of only head versus a week earlier Tuesdays kill was FOOD FIBER exchangescfood NEW YORK Dow JonesArabica coffee futures on the Coffee Sugar Cocoa Exchange settled lower Tuesday in an extension of the selling wave that started on Monday traders said The bearish tone of the market was set from the opening bell with prices leaning to the downside on perceptions that the reported drawdown on Green Coffee Associations stocks was too low Cocoa futures settled lower Tuesday after a late bout of hedge selling kept the market near the sessions low The move was called a corrective pullback by some participants but it wasnt expected to alter the markets longterm bullish outlook Cocoa prices whipsawed for the first half of the session in very thin volume with early long liquidation weighing on prices Once that quieted down some short covering by locals briefly pushed the mostactive March contract into positive terrain until renewed light selling emerged World March raw sugar futures closed at a sixweek low Tuesday after a dramatic trading session which featured a massive amount of technical selling by funds The market began weaker off the back of heavy selling in the Liffe market Locals and small speculators sold the market down to cents which is where funds sellstops kickedin and then a downward spiral ensued After the market hit a low of cents a pound locals and speculators started short covering but the rally was short lived and selling once agaiin took charge of the market Final volume was estimated at a hefty lots After a listless session cotton futures on the New York Cotton Exchange settled lower Tuesday in what some participants described as a consolidation move The market opened modestly lower in light trade selling and the most active March contract floated within a relatively tight trading range for most of the session There is really nothing going on its a

resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed firmer today Prices have leveled off the past week after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low Technically bulls

resistance is seen at First support is seen at LIVESTOCK June live cattle closed higher at today Prices scored a consolidative inside day on the daily bar chart today On Wednesday prices gapped sharply lower and hit a fresh eightmonth low Reports that cash cattle traded lower this week sent the futures market tumbling The June futures are still overextended on the downside technically on a shortterm basis The bears are in full control of the market Prices are trading way below an accelerating twomonthold downtrend line on the daily bar chart Next support basis June is seen at Wednesdays low First resistance comes in at the level August feeder cattle closed up cents today at Prices also posted a corrective rebound after the sharp losses Wednesday Recent history continues to play out

lower trend down to the January low just above the level Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at June lean hogs closed firmer today The bears still have the momentum on their side at present Next support lies at todays low First resistance is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed cents lower at today A bearish USDA report indicating large carryover stocks of corn pushed prices lower today Prices closed near the session low after gapping sharply lower on the daily bar chart Prices were under pressure earlier this week after weekly crop progress reports showed good cornplanting progress in the US The past years of chart history shows nearby corn futures prices do not stay below very long However the shorterterm technicals are very bearish at present and wouldbe bottom pickers dont want to stand in front of a freight train Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at todays high of July soybeans closed cents lower at today Prices closed near the session low amid a bearish USDA report released this morning The bearish report did put pressure on the market but not the strong pressure corn saw Traders have factored much of the bearish news into the soybean market Odds are lessening that a minor bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart Bears still have the solid advantage Fundamentally there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term Its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher First resistance is seen at the area and then First support is seen at July soybean meal closed off at today Prices did not put in that bad of a performance today given the bearish USDA report Prices this week are consolidating after they pushed to a fresh eightweek high last Friday Recent price action is still encouraging to the bulls and is one sign the lows are in place in the meal market Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points lower at cents today Prices scored a fresh contract low today of cents Oil is technically weaker than beans or meal right now But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat closed cents higher at today A bullish USDA report boosted wheat higher but prices did back off from the highs and close near the session low due mostly to the weakness in corn and soybeans Prices just Wednesday touched the contract low of If prices can post a strong bounce in the next couple sessions a doublebottom reversal pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart Bears are in command Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions First support lies at the contract low of Next resistance is seen at todays high KC July HRW wheat closed up cents at today A bullish USDA wheat production figure today boosted HRW Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart but backed well off the highs by the close It will be important for bulls to show some followthrough strength on Friday Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions and bears still rule For bulls to get back in the ballgame they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart created last week by pushing prices to the area Thats a tall order right now Next resistance is seen at the level todays high Next support is seen at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points higher at cents today We now could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar on the daily bar chart This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains A threemonth high was scored in July sugar late last week The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating sixweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at cents First support is now seen at cents July NY coffee closed points higher at cents today Prices closed near the session high The bulls have gained momentum of late This recent upmove is the most significant showing by the bulls since midJanuary The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging for the bulls toogiven recent price history Still the bears could be setting a trap like they did in early January If bulls can push prices above cents and then see followthrough strength bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable First resistance comes in at cents First support is seen cents July NY cocoa closed higher today at Prices today matched the sixweek high scored yesterday and finished close to the session high Tuesdays strong gaphigher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears If prices can push higher Friday bulls will have the edge Prices this week pushed above and negated a monthold downtrend line on the daily bar chart Next resistance comes in at First support is now seen at July cotton closed points lower at cents today Prices scored a new contract low in the wake of a bearish USDA report However most traders did expect the bearish figures in the reportnamely high carryover stocks Cotton is presently in a strong bear market Right now any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears But my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next support lies at cents First resistance is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should beware July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Prices closed near the session high again today after Wednesday pushing higher and filling an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart Todays USDA report was termed mostly neutral by the trade Bulls are gaining confidence after the past two days action Next resistance is now seen at cents Next support comes in at cents METALS June COMEX gold closed off today at Prices corrected a bit today after Wednesdays strong gains that pushed prices to a twomonth high This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its earlyApril low This weeks type of price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart Next resistance is located at First support is seen at July silver closed down today at an ounce Prices sold off sharply today after rallying sharply Wednesday This should not surprise many Silver prices are still not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at Bears still have the advantage July NY copper closed points lower today at cents Prices today matched the contract low scored in early April The stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper

Euro currency closed points lower at today Prices scored a bearish outside day down today and pushed to a fresh fourweek low Bears have the edge The European Central Bank ECB cut interest rates today which initially boosted the Euro but those gains were shortlived My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro Look for more choppy action in the near term Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Bears are in control Bulls are hoping for some basing activity at lower levels and that may be occurring although its too early to tell Next support now lies at the level First resistance is seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points lower at Bears are in command as prices scored a bearish outside day down on the daily bar chart today Prices pushed to a fresh fourweek low today Still my bias is that prices wont deteriorate much more Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed unchanged at today Prices pushed to another fresh twomonth high today The bulls have the advantage as a sixweekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Mondays key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago What it does suggest is a downside correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term Bulls still have the slight edge on a shortterm basis This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points higher at Trading continues choppy at lower levels This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move above the level would be considered a bullish upside breakout from the recent congestion area A move below would be considered a bearish downside breakout Next support is now seen at the level Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Prices scored a bullish outside day up on the daily bar chart and pushed to a fresh fourweek high Bulls have the momentum in the near term Next resistance lies at the level First support is seen at the area My bias is still that a nearterm

to point out here One July corn now the nearby contract did not stay below the key perbushel level very long Secondly notice how even some hot temps forecast for midMay popped prices higher I suspect that with prices this low going into the growing season this type of kneejerk reaction to any changes in the weather patterns will be the norm Still bottom pickers should beware Next resistance is now seen at Next support is seen at July soybeans closed cents higher at today Like corn beans were boosted by a mini weather scare and ideas that now there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans Importantly the bean market did not fare that badly technically last week in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures Todays big upside push propelled prices to a fresh fiveweek high and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at Bears still have the advantage Its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher First resistance is now seen at the area and then First support is now seen at July soybean meal closed up at today Prices today pushed to a fresh nearly threemonthhigh Importantly prices pushed above the congestion area on the daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid sign the lows are in place in the meal market Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Prices scored another new contract low today of cents Oil is still technically weaker than beans or meal right now But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed cents higher at today Hot and dry weather forecast for the US Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today Now odds have increased that a doublebottom reversal on the daily bar chart will be confirmed The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led to the stronger upside movement today Prices last Wednesday touched the contract low of Bears still have the slight edge but bulls are gaining confidence rapidly First resistance lies at the area Next support is seen at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today Prices scored a bearish outside day down on the daily bar chart today We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon Bulls can still correctly argue that todays pullback was just consolidation amid good prices gains seen recently A threemonth high was scored in July sugar just recently A sixweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at centstodays high First support is seen at cents July NY coffee closed cents lower at cents today Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of the bulls balloon They had gained momentum lately Not much technical damage will occur if prices can rebound but if good followthrough selling occurs Tuesday then odds significantly increase that prices will test the recent lows First support comes in at cents First resistance is seen at cents todays high July NY cocoa closed higher today at Prices scored a corrective inside day on the daily bar chart today following Fridays big sell off The bears wanted to see followthrough selling today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart but that did not occur Bulls and bears are still on a level playing field Next resistance comes in at First support is now seen at July cotton closed points higher at cents today Hot and dry weather in the cottongrowing regions of the US combined with a technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly higher today The cotton market will be like the grains Prices are so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially adverse weather patterns are forecast There was good followthrough buying today from Fridays outside day up on the daily bar chart and a key reversal up was confirmed This gives the bulls a bit more confidence Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be selling opportunities for the bears Lets see what happens this week My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next resistance lies at cents First support now is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should still beware July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Prices closed near the session high Last week bulls filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart They have gained confidence

low July lumber futures closed the limit of higher again today at Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new forthemove high Bulls are really snorting now Expect more volatility as is typical for this market The next upside objective for the bulls is now the area and then First support is seen at the area This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines But the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong side of the lumber market METALS June COMEX gold closed up today at Prices corrected a bit more today after last Wednesdays strong gains that pushed prices to a twomonth high This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its earlyApril low Recent price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart Next resistance is located at the recent high First support is seen at July silver closed up today at an ounce Same story Silver prices are not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at Bears have the advantage July NY copper closed points lower today at cents A bearish US economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new contract low The stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed higher at today Bulls and bears are still at a standoff but bulls will gain the edge on a move above Expect more choppy trading Next support is seen at Next resistance lies at July heating oil closed points lower today at Bulls still have the slight edge Look for more choppy trading in the near future Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today After prices scored a new contract high last week they have sold off dramatically The increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market Bulls have lost their edge Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at July natural gas closed cents higher at today After prices hit a fresh fiveandonehalfmonth low last Wednesday weve seen corrective consolidation Bears still have the edge Next support is seen at and first resistance is at STOCKS FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points lower at today Prices pushed to another fresh fourweek low today Bears have the edge My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro but the markets are always right so well see Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Bears are in control Bulls are hoping for some basing activity at lower levels and that may be occurring although its too early to tell Next support now lies at the level First resistance is seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points lower at Bears are in command Prices pushed to a fresh month low today and took out the midApril low of If we see followthrough selling to push prices significantly below todays low that a bearish signal and portends significantly more downside A monthold downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart and it has accelerated recently Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last Thursday and the bulls have the advantage as a six weekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Bulls are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high They still have the slight edge on a shortterm basis but they will lose it if they cant turn prices at least sideways this week This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points lower at Trading continues choppy at lower levels As prices approach the lower portion of the recent trading range strong support should kick in and provide for a bounce But if prices fall below the early April low of then the door is open to much steeper losses This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move below would be considered a bearish downside breakout Next support is now seen at the level Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Prices also pushed to a fresh fourweek high again today Next resistance lies at the level

been trading sideways for several weeks The sideways trading favors the bulls but they still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed higher at Same story Prices have leveled off the past four weeks after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low This does favor the bulls but not greatly Technically bulls still need to push prices above the resistance area My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes wont be dramatic but a slower grind higher with fits and starts First resistance is seen at First support is seen at LIVESTOCK June live cattle closed higher at today Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today and on news that boxed beef prices had improved Last week prices hit a fresh multimonth low Still prices are in an accelerating twomonthold downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have control Next support basis June is seen at First resistance comes in at the level August feeder cattle closed off cents today at The rally in the corn market today hurt feeders If recent history continues to play out in feeders prices may dip a bit more but the support area of will cap losses That is the lower level of the trading band in place for the past several weeks If prices break down below the bottom of the recent trading range then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the January low just above the level Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at and then at June lean hogs closed higher at today Commercial buying was seen in the futures pits reports said Price action today saw more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present Next support lies at First resistance is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed cents higher at today Another mini weather scare popped prices today Two important things to point out here One July corn now the nearby contract did not stay below the key perbushel level very long Secondly notice how even some hot temps forecast for midMay popped prices higher I suspect that with prices this low going into the growing season this type of kneejerk reaction to any changes in the weather patterns will be the norm Still bottom pickers should beware Next resistance is now seen at Next support is seen at July soybeans closed cents higher at today Like corn beans were boosted by a mini weather scare and ideas that now there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans Importantly the bean market did not fare that badly technically last week in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures Todays big upside push propelled prices to a fresh fiveweek high and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at Bears still have the advantage Its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher First resistance is now seen at the area and then First support is now seen at July soybean meal closed up at today Prices today pushed to a fresh nearly threemonthhigh Importantly prices pushed above the congestion area on the daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid sign the lows are in place in the meal market Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Prices scored another new contract low today of cents Oil is still technically weaker than beans or meal right now But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed cents higher at today Hot and dry weather forecast for the US Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today Now odds have increased that a doublebottom reversal on the daily bar chart will be confirmed The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led to the stronger upside movement today Prices last Wednesday touched the contract low of Bears still have the slight edge but bulls are gaining confidence rapidly First resistance lies at the area Next support is seen at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today Prices scored a bearish outside day down on the daily bar chart today We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon Bulls can still correctly argue that todays pullback was just consolidation amid good prices gains seen recently A threemonth high was scored in July sugar just recently A sixweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at centstodays high First support is seen at cents July NY coffee closed cents lower at cents today Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of the bulls balloon They had gained momentum lately Not much technical damage will occur if prices can rebound but if good followthrough selling occurs Tuesday then odds significantly increase that prices will test the recent lows First support comes in at cents First resistance is seen at cents todays high July NY cocoa closed higher today at Prices scored a corrective inside day on the daily bar chart today following Fridays big sell off The bears wanted to see followthrough selling today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart but that did not occur Bulls and bears are still on a level playing field Next resistance comes in at First support is now seen at July cotton closed points higher at cents today Hot and dry weather in the cottongrowing regions of the US combined with a technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly higher today The cotton market will be like the grains Prices are so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially adverse weather patterns are forecast There was good followthrough buying today from Fridays outside day up on the daily bar chart and a key reversal up was confirmed This gives the bulls a bit more confidence Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be selling opportunities for the bears Lets see what happens this week My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next resistance lies at cents First support now is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should still beware July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Prices closed near the session high Last week bulls filled an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart They have gained confidence after the recent price action but will need to see more upside action this weekpushing prices above centsto gain solid momentum Next resistance is seen at cents Next support comes in at centstodays low July lumber futures closed the limit of higher again today at Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new forthemove high Bulls are really snorting now Expect more volatility as is typical for this market The next upside objective for the bulls is now the area and then First support is seen at the area This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines But the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong side of the lumber market METALS June COMEX gold closed up today at Prices corrected a bit more today after last Wednesdays strong gains that pushed prices to a twomonth high This market is in a nice uptrend since scoring its earlyApril low Recent price action is what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart Next resistance is located at the recent high First support is seen at July silver closed up today at an ounce Same story Silver prices are not that far above the contract low Prices are chopping at lower levels and this suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at Bears have the advantage July NY copper closed points lower today at cents A bearish US economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new contract low The stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed higher at today Bulls and bears are still at a standoff but bulls will gain the edge on a move above Expect more choppy trading Next support is seen at Next resistance lies at July heating oil closed points lower today at Bulls still have the slight edge Look for more choppy trading in the near future Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today After prices scored a new contract high last week they have sold off dramatically The increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market Bulls have lost their edge Next support is seen at First resistance

seen at and first resistance is at STOCKS FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points lower at today Prices pushed to another fresh fourweek low today Bears have the edge My bias is

seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points lower at Bears are in command Prices pushed to a fresh month low today and took out the midApril low of If we see followthrough selling to push prices significantly below todays low that a bearish signal and portends significantly more downside A monthold downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart and it has accelerated recently Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last Thursday and the bulls have the advantage as a six weekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Bulls are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high They still have the slight edge on a shortterm basis but they will lose it if they cant turn prices at least sideways this week This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points lower at Trading continues choppy at lower levels As prices approach the lower portion of the recent trading range strong support should kick in and provide for a bounce But if prices fall below the early April low of then the door is open to much steeper losses This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move below would be considered a bearish downside breakout Next support is now seen at the level Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Prices also pushed to a fresh fourweek high again today Next resistance lies at the level First support is seen at the area My bias is still that there is not much upside left in the dollar index But this week technical odds have increased that a new high will be scored Well see Markets are never wrong analysts are June US Tbonds closed higher today at Prices scored a corrective inside day today after Fridays price crash to a sixmonth low All eyes are on this weeks FOMC meeting at which a decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon Shortterm indicators show the market is still overdone on the downside but nobody should stand in front of a steaming locomotive Longerterm charts do show good support at the even area First resistance is now seen at even or par The June US Tnote closed up nds today at Prices scored a corrective inside day after crashing to a fivemonth low Friday Bears have the edge now as severe technical damage has been inflicted

distance of the April high of Sideways trading the past week has negated a fledgling fourweekold uptrend on the daily bar chart Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is resistance at the key area First support is seen at the area June SP futures closed firmer today Prices have leveled off the past week after rallying solidly off the earlyApril low Technically bulls still need to push prices above the resistance area My bias is still that any recovery in the stock market and the stock indexes wont be dramatic but a slower grind higher with fits and starts First resistance is seen at First support is seen at LIVESTOCK June live cattle closed cents higher at Prices closed at the session low and managed to fill an upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in early trading The market saw another upside corrective bounce earlier today after punching to a fresh month low last Friday The bears are in control of the market Prices are still trading below an accelerating twomonthold downtrend line on the daily bar chart The market is still a bit shortterm oversold and I would not be surprised to see more of an upside correction this week Next support basis June is seen at First resistance now comes in at the level August feeder cattle closed up cents today at Prices closed at the session low today Rangebound trade continues As this market neared the bottom end of the recent trading range which is around the market again took an upside bias Look for more choppy trading between and If prices can break out of that aforementioned range the direction of the breakout will likely be the direction of the next significant trend Next resistance is seen at todays high First support is seen at June lean hogs closed higher today at Prices are still showing consolidation at lower levels after the sell off last week Hogs are still a bit overdone on the downside on a shortterm basis so some more corrective upside consolidation would not surprise me Still the bears have the strong momentum on their side at present Next support lies at First resistance is located at the leveltodays high GRAINS July corn futures closed off cents at today Crop progress reports out Monday evening showing very good planting progress in the US weighed on the corn market today There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now The weak wheat market is also weighing on corn On Monday respected Iowa State University Climatologist Elwynn Taylor predicted record yields for the Corn Belt this year It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in the near term Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at the leveltodays high July soybeans closed cents higher at today Prices are consolidating the recent gains but bulls still by no means have any significant momentum Fundamentally there is not much in the way of good news for bulls right now I would not be surprised to see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term This market is still in technical trouble and its going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices solidly higher First resistance is seen at the area and then First support is seen at and then at July soybean meal closed off at today Prices this week are showing a corrective pullback after they pushed to a fresh eightweek high last Friday Recent price action is still encouraging to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market Next resistance comes in at the area First support is seen at July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Prices saw a corrective bounce today after dropping to a new contract low of cents on Monday This market is technically much weaker than beans or meal and is still a bit overdone on the downside on a shortterm basis I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at the contract low of cents July Chicago wheat closed cents lower at today Prices poked to a new contract low of More rain in the Plains has cast a bearish pall over the market With the wheat crop behind schedule anyway the recent rains could allow the crop to make some good improvement Bears are in full command Just last

oversold and I suspect well see a corrective bounce soon SOFTS July NY sugar closed points higher at cents today We could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar on the daily bar chart This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains A threemonth high was scored in July sugar late last week The bulls have good momentum and a steep and accelerating fiveweekold uptrend line is still in place on the daily bar chart Next resistance now comes in at cents First support is now seen at cents July NY coffee closed points higher at cents today Prices pushed to another fresh twomonth high today as the bulls continue to gain momentum This recent move is the most significant showing by the bulls since midJanuary The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past three sessions is encouraging for the bulls toogiven recent price history Still the bears could be setting a trap like they did in early January If bulls can push prices above cents and then see followthrough strength bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable First resistance comes in at cents First support is seen cents July NY cocoa closed higher today at Todays strong gaphigher trade on the daily bar

support is now seen at todays low of July cotton closed points lower at cents today Cotton is in a strong bear market and a new contract low was scored just today at cents Right now any rebounds are likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears But my bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next support lies at cents First resistance is seen around cents Wouldbe bottompickers should beware Bulls need to watch for some basing action which may be beginning July orange juice futures closed points lower today at cents Prices late last week probed into an important gap area on the daily bar chart which begins at cents but did not fill that gap on the upside Bears rule and the market is still technically weak However if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside thats an important first step for the bulls in turning the market around That gap will be filled if prices move above cents which is first resistance Next support comes in at cents July lumber futures closed lower at today Prices just Monday hit yet a new forthemove high at as the bull market roars on Todays price action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market Expect more volatility however as is typical for this market The next upside objective for the bulls is the area First support is seen at the area This market is still shortterm overbought technically and I would not be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon METALS June COMEX gold closed down today at Prices late last week pushed to a new sevenweek high Despite recent choppy trading this market is still trending up from its earlyApril low But bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what momentum they have recently gained But the fact that prices have not sold way off after the rally is encouraging to the bulls Next resistance is located at First support is seen at July silver closed up today at an ounce Prices are not that far above the contract low Still prices are chopping at lower levels This suggests a basing action that many markets need to change the trend from down to sideways to eventually up Next support is seen at First resistance is seen at Bears still have the advantage July NY copper closed cents lower today at cents Stock market weakness helped drive this market lower today Prices are still attempting to build a base and recover from the earlyApril low My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper The stock market and the US economy will have to be healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper however Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed lower at today Bulls and bears are at a standoff and will duke it out over the near term Expect more

support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today Prices scored a new contract high just Monday and saw followthrough selling today That confirms a key reversal in this market But given the recent volatility in unleaded I am not placing a lot of emphasis on this key reversal Bulls are still in command as peak driving season nears Toppickers beware Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at July natural gas closed cents higher at today Today was just an upside correction in a steep downtrend Prices hit a fresh fiveandonehalfmonth low Monday Next support is seen at and first resistance is now at This market is still shortterm oversold technically FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points lower at today Bears have the decided edge again as bulls have lost all the momentum they had gained in midApril My bias is still that there is not much downside left in the Euro Look for more choppy action in the near term Bulls will again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the area Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh sixweek high last Friday but bears are still in control Bulls are hoping for some basing activity at lower levels and that may be occurring although its too early to tell Next support now lies at the level First resistance is seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points lower today at Bears are in command Still my bias is that prices wont deteriorate much more Next support is seen at the level First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high late last week and are consolidating a bit this week The bulls still have the advantage as a fiveweekold uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart My bias is that the lows are in place First resistance is now seen at First support is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Prices sold off some more today after the key reversal down on the daily bar chart that was scored Monday Bulls had good momentum but have lost some the past two sessions The key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago What it does suggest is a decent downside correction to the recent gains will occur over the near term This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside Next resistance is seen at the level First support is seen at the level The June British pound closed points lower at Trading continues choppy at lower levels This currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside in the sterling One could argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north A move above the level would be considered a bullish upside breakout from the recent congestion area Next support is now seen at the level Next resistance comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Bulls are regaining

previous sessions trading range with a lower close Bulls need to show some resolve soon after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late April A steep sixweekold downtrend line was penetrated on

temper the bearish outlook in July wheat while increasing the odds that this weeks lows marked a double bottom SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead of the weekend However Thursdays bearish supplydemand report and corn planting delays in the western Corn Belt continue to limit upside potential Momentum indicators have become overbought and are turning neutral to bearish signaling that Mays correction in time might have come to an end I am looking for sideways to lower soybean prices during the last half of May with Aprils low being a possible target July soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursdays losses However upside potential remains limited in the face of bearish soybean fundamentals Momentum indicators have become overbought and are turning neutral to bearish warning traders to use caution as this springs corrective rebound might have come to an end Closes below this weeks low would likely trigger additional longliquidation next week LIVESTOCK June hogs closed steady on Friday as gains were limited due to sharp losses in bellies Commercial buying prompted by strong cash bids that were up to higher on the day supported prices Sluggish hog movement and inadequate packer inventories continue to support the cash market which has underpinned the lateweek rally Technically June hogs continue to rebound off the uptrend line which is to be expected following Aprils sharp decline Until this support level is broken this springs setback is nothing more than a correction within a bull market June cattle closed lower on Friday as it posted a downside reversal Session highs spiked above broken support crossing at Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm todays bearish reversal pattern If this springs decline resumes last Septembers low at then weekly support crossing at are potential targets Both weekly and daily momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones hinting that an important low might be near FOOD FIBER July coffee posted a downside reversal on Friday erasing Thursdays gains Momentum indicators have become very overbought warning traders to use caution as a shortterm top might be in or near Julys inability to fill Marchs gap at underscores the weak tone of the market Closes below Thursdays low at would confirm that this springs short covering bounce has likely come to an end July cocoa posted a huge key reversal down on Friday due to profit taking that erased much of this weeks gains Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm todays bearish reversal pattern From a broader perspective July cocoa needs to close above or below to confirm a breakout of this springs trading range July sugar closed modestly higher on Friday as it continues to form a small symmetrical triangle A breakout in either direction of this consolidation formation will point the direction of the next trending move If this springs rally resumes Januarys high at is Julys next target Closes below this weeks low at would increase the odds that a shortterm top has likely been posted July cotton posted a key reversal up on Friday due to short covering ahead of the weekend Nevertheless Fridays high did nothing more than test broken support crossing at Multiple closes above this broken support level are needed to temper the bearish outlook in the market If this springs decline continues psychological support crossing at cents is Julys next downside target later this month Daily

wheat production figure today boosted HRW Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart but backed well off the highs by the close It will be important for bulls to show some followthrough strength on

statements Technically both the Nasdaq and SP index gapped higher on the open thereby confirming upside breakouts of this years downtrend lines This weeks gains have turned weekly momentum indicators bullish signaling sideways to higher prices are possible this spring The Dow also soared to a new high for the month following this mornings unexpected interest rate cut that caught the market off guard The Dow was up over points during the session and traded above trading range support crossing at and the FebruaryMarch downtrend line crossing near While a round of profit taking is possible ahead of the weekend todays strong performance as set the stage for additional gains this spring INTEREST RATES June bonds posted a key reversal up on Wednesday following todays surprise cut in interest rates Traders quickly began to speculate on the size of the next rate cut which traders seem to think will be another basis points at the May FOMC meeting Additional strength on Thursday

Tuesdays bearish API inventory data for crude oil The latest API data showed that crude oil inventories have risen to million barrels the highest level since August Todays sell off led to a breakout below Aprils uptrend line thereby increasing the odds that June crude oil might have posted a shortterm top A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of todays losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday Stochastics and RSI are overbought but remain bullish June heating oil gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday due to spillover weakness from crude oil and the

rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to attract following through buying in the afternoon session Additional weakness on Thursday would confirm todays bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the chances that a double top has likely been posted The June Swiss Franc and Dmark closed higher on Wednesday due to latesession short covering rallies Early weakness pushed the Swiss Franc toward last falls lows however selling dried up near minor support crossing at Additional strength on Thursday would confirm todays spindle bottoms and would set the stage for additional short covering into earlyMay The June Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday but near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close The late session bounce could spillover into Thursdays session however momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish warning traders that last weeks high might have marked a double top Look for sideways to lower trading into the end of April The June

signaling that additional gains nearterm are still possible if June can clear resistance crossing at Closes below Aprils uptrend line crossing near would signal an end to this months corrective bounce July silver extended Tuesdays loss but like June gold managed to close near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close Nevertheless this weeks setback suggests that July silver

latest weather forecast are calling for additional precip across the Midwest which could delay fieldwork However the latest planting progress report shows that corn planting thus far has progressed at an average pace This weeks setback has turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that Mondays high might have marked a double top Traders will be looking at Thursdays export sales report for nearterm direction However bulls are not holding out much hope for a bullish sales report on Thursday It appears that May corn will remain range bound between and for the time being until the market can get a better handle on planting progress and early growing conditions May wheat posted an upside reversal on Wednesday as spring wheat planting delays offered mild support to the market Additional support came from this years winter wheat crop ratings which remain well below last years levels Gains were limited as export demand remains quiet Technically momentum indicators

Decembers low crossing at later this winter The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness nearterm is likely The March Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a higher close on Wednesday however it failed to close above the previous reaction high crossing at Closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm this weeks trendline breakout and that a bottom has been posted Stochastics are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into midFebruary The March Japanese Yen extended this weeks short covering rebound on Wednesday and spiked above broken weekly support crossing at Closes above this broken support level and last falls downtrend line crossing near are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into earlyFebruary PRECIOUS METALS exchangescmetals February gold closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to short covering following the Feds decision to hold the line in interest rates for the time being February gold is challenging minor resistance crossing at Closes above this resistance level would open the door for a test of broken trendline support crossing near Stochastics and the RSI are oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that a shortterm bottom is in or near March silver closed modestly lower on Wednesday leaving Tuesdays key reversal up unconfirmed Momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a low might be in or is near following this weeks test of the retracement level crossing at Closes above broken fib support crossing at are needed before a low can be confirmed March copper drifted lower on Wednesday and appears poised to test the bottom of last weeks trading range crossing at later this week Closes below last weeks low crossing at would open the door for a largerdegree decline during February Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early February GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed fractionally lower on Wednesday as session lows came with in a penny of weekly support crossing that crosses at Light pressure came from spillover weakness from wheat concerns over sluggish export demand and a rebound in the US Dollar today Traders will closely watching Thursdays export sales report for signs that foreign demand might be picking up Bulls continue to suggest that this years export sales will be backend loaded In the meantime there is little incentive for foreign customers or domestic end users to shift their buying pattern from hand to mouth as prices continue to erode from last Julys high Seasonally corn prices tend to decline into February when a midwinter low is due to be posted The current decline suggests that the February low might be posted early in the month if weekly support crossing at halts the decline Shortterm momentum indicators are bearish but have entered their respective oversold zones hinting that a low might be near March wheat gapped down and closed sharply lower on Wednesday as much needed precip has fallen across the southern Plains The bearish weather triggered another round of fund selling that pressured the market to new lows for month which fell just short of testing the lateDecember low crossing at If this support level fails to halt this months decline a test of the December low crossing at is likely by earlyFebruary Recent strength in the US Dollar has made US wheat less competitive on the world market especially since Argentina is resuming wheat exports Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is likely into earlyFebruary SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close on Wednesday Light support was due to short covering triggered by ideas that soybean prices have become oversold and too cheap However upside potential appears limited due to improving weather conditions across South America and a narrowing window of opportunity to export on the world market without competing with South American exports Technically March soybeans continue to consolidate above the retracement level of Januarys rally which crosses at Closes below this support level would more than likely open the door for a test of this months low crossing at by earlyFebruary Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into earlyFebruary before a midwinter low is due to be posted March soybean meal closed lower on Wednesday however a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of todays loss March continues to hover above gap support crossing at and below this the retracement level of Januarys rally crossing at Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are still possible into earlyFebruary While Thursdays export sales report is expected to show strong sales this is old news to a market which has been focused on South Americas potentially record crop for most of the winter Now that South American weather is improving there is little incentive for new buying to enter the market Therefore I am looking for additional weakness into midFebruary and a possible test of Januarys low of before a bottom is finally posted LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock April hogs posted a key reversal up and closed above weekly resistance crossing at on Wednesday Todays rally was triggered by ideas that packers could encounter a shortterm supply squeeze which could be exaggerated by the winter snowstorm that is moving across portions of the Midwest today and could last into Thursday bringing with it up to inches of snow in places However todays rally was limited due to forecasts calling for steady to cent lower cash bids on Thursday With packer margins shrinking due to falling product prices it is unlikely that they will be very aggressive with their cash bids However traders might decide to ignore the shortterm bearish cash fundamentals and opt to trade the shortterm friendly technicals near term Closes above the contract high crossing at would renew Aprils rally off last falls low and could lead to a test of weekly resistance crossing at later this winter Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are still possible into earlyFebruary April cattle closed slightly higher on Wednesday as a winter storm across the Plains and portions of the Midwest sparked additional short covering However todays rally was stopped in its tracks as it neared the retracement level of last years decline which crosses at After rallying for the past three days I would not be surprised to see a round of profit taking on Thursday as April might try to consolidate recent gains below this resistance level If this resistance level is cleared we could see April test the lower boundary of last summers trading range crossing at later this winter Momentum indicators are bullish but diverging which is a warning to bulls that a shortterm top might be near FOOD FIBER exchangescfood March coffee closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering following Tuesdays spike to a new contract low However short covering faded ahead of the close which allowed prices to drift towards the bottom of todays trading range March is at a crossroads as it is challenging the lower boundary of this winters trading range The latest report from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries highlighted the markets negative fundamental outlook as it forecasted a million kilogram bag surplus in export supplies for the marketing year Closes below trading range support crossing at would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a test of psychological support crossing at cents later this winter March cocoa posted its highest close in two and a half weeks on Wednesday due to renewed trade and speculator buying Light support came from reports of a police strike in the Ivory Coast limited hedge pressure and technical buying as buy stops were triggered above However the choppy rebound off the earlyJanuary low is an indication that the market continues to mark time as a distribution top continues to form Closes above or below are needed to confirm a breakout of this winters trading range and point the direction of the next trending move March sugar extended this months decline and closed below last Novembers reaction low crossing at on Wednesday Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for additional weakness and a possible test of last Octobers low crossing at during February Momentum indicators have entered their respective oversold zones but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm March cotton broke out below minor support marked by last weeks low at on Wednesday thereby renewing its decline off Januarys double top The stage is set for a likely test of the lower boundary of this winters trading range which crosses at Light pressure came from increased producer selling Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional

for a likely test of weekly support crossing at possibly later this week The recent break off Januarys high has opened the door for a likely decline into February when a midwinter low is due to be posted Weekend rains have halted a decline in South American corn yields while export demand remains sluggish due in part to the rally in the US Dollar which has made US corn more expensive than foreign feed grade wheat for example There is little fresh bullish news for the market to chew on between now and the first of March which leaves the door wide open for commodity funds to continue to pressure the market lower Shortterm momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the first half of February March wheat extended its breakout below

export sales were off set by weather forecast which are calling for increased chances for precip across the southern Plains which could drop some much needed moisture in the form of rain or snow later this week Expectations for increased competition from Argentina wheat on the world market offers little nearterm support to the market until it sees a significant increase in export demand for US wheat SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans closed lower on Tuesday due to renewed fund selling which was triggered by weakness in soybean meal The sell off of the past two weeks has largely factored in improving weather conditions across South America with only the uncertainty of Chinese demand left for bears to sell into Todays low fell just short of testing the retracement level of

March corn closed lower on Monday in sympathy with wheat along with a lackluster weekly inspection report released this morning This mornings report came in at million bushels down from the previous week but up from the same period last year Additional pressure came from weekend rains across dry portions of southern Brazil and Argentina which will help stabilize yields The soaring US Dollar is also having an impact on export demand despite relatively low domestic prices The sharp declines in Asian currencies continue to make US corn and soybeans less competitive on the world market which has resulted in sluggish export demand Unless we see a significant setback in the US Dollar and or further yield reductions in South Americans corn crop potential the corn market is likely to struggle into the first half of February when a midwinter low is due to be posted March wheat closed sharply lower on Monday following last Fridays commitment of traders report which showed a largerthanexpected speculative long position in the market This report triggered longliquidation through out the day and was exacerbated by this mornings disappointing export inspection report The

inspection report that came in at million bushels up from last weeks million bushels Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into earlyFebruary I would not rule out a test of the early January low which crosses at March soybean meal gapped down on the open following overnight weakness triggered by weekend rains across South America However a short covering rally unfolded when March was unable to fill the January th gap crossing at in early trading Once this mornings gap at was filled additional short covering was triggered which led to the

that would have left anyone winded The final twist came in the last hour of trading when the Dow Jones Industrial Average went from a point gain to a one point loss after the Senate said it would likely shelve the economic stimulus bill that president George W Bush said would hasten the economys recovery Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle said neither Republicans nor Democrats had enough votes to win approval for their competing measures so he would likely withdraw it A lot of companies were counting on some kind of fiscal stimulus to give their operations a boost a kind of extra push toward profitability Now some people have to recalibrate their expectations said Scott Curtis head of trading at Credit Lyonnais It seemd when stocks reached a certain selloff point investors came in and shares rose But other investors eager to book any kind of profit almost just as quickly crowded in to sell leaving stocks in seesaw mode That kind of action does not bode well for putting together anything sustainable to the upside Curtis said You have to be more shortterm oriented right now going for nickels and dimes not dollars Dow Jones INTEREST RATES exchangescinterest Debt futures bounced back on short covering late in the session to finish slightly mixed after Senate majority leader Tom Daschle indicated that an economic stimulus bill would probably be shelved That prompted some uncertainty about how strong an economic recovery the market should expect Previously debt prices had been hurt by an auction that was described by analysts as poorly received and ugly as well as by strength in equities around the time of the auction While there was a delinkage between the stock and Treasury markets late in the session the link was beginning to return just ahead of the close and continued in afterhours electronic trading sources said The CRB INDEX exchangescindexes No report today ENERGY MARKETS exchangescenergy Crude oil and energy products futures closed lower but off their

refinery shutdown said John Kilduff an analyst at Fimat USA Inc of the price surge at the close But he emphasized that locals were behind the last minute buying in an attempt to break resistance at bbl In the afternoon session crude came off its lows on news that Iraqi exports were steady at million barrels a day in the week ended Feb However Iraqid oil exports were down about to mln bnd over the last two months OsterDowJones CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies In erratic trading Tuesday the dollar firmed broadly as fears of another dollarweakening selloff in the Dow Jones Industrial Average proved to be unfounded Traders continue to suggest that the currency market favors the dollar with Mondays euro and yen gains just a brief reversal within a dollar uptrend Its been whippy but the general trend is that you should be buying dollars said Joe Francomano vice president of foreign exchange at Erste Bank in New York Tuesday the possibility of further unpleasant surprises tied to US corporate accounting was a major concern for equity investors and injected additional uncertainty into both equity and foreignexchange trading said analysts Traders werent surprised when the euro initially edged higher overnight climbing to test resistance at But the single currency lost momentum and began to ease back in the face of some solid dollar buying traders said Dollaryen moved higher

York said was an important level because its where products have been waiting to sell gold for a while Mar copper futures remained entrenched within a to cents per pound range Tuesday as profittaking and short covering continued to cancel each other out to keep prices mainly flat Mar made frequent probes of support in the cent area throughout the day and even dipped below on occasion to register threeday lows of cents However dip buying and further short covering at the lows propped up activity and eventually carried prices back to the cent area by settlement GRAINS exchangescgrains Corn

the upside soybeans had nothing but an empty news from and a South American weather forecast that has already been largely factored into prices OsterDowJones LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock Fund buying and commercial selling made for a higher lean hog futures market that was underpinned by friendly cash fundamentals The prospect of steady to strong live hog bids has led to firm midweek futures ideas A couple of days ago it appeared nothing on the cash side favored lean hog traders Now there is an air of cautious invincibility There is no bade news a pit source said However a few others are still scratching their heads over the wishywashy trade the past week or so that left little in the way of solid information to chart market diredction The market lean hogs is up one day and down the next the pork complex trader said There is nothing to hang your hat on he added Higher lean hogs provided moral support to bellies which ended the session strong on latesession activity OsterDowJones FOOD

to their shorts and they are not done yet said one desk broker in New York Theyrre going to get their net position back to shorts In the week ended Jan large speculators held contracts in the CSCE coffee futures market but when options are included the funds net position is short contracts according to the COT report issued by the CFTC every Friday This number has led some traders to wonder whether the selling of shorts isnt nearing an end It was a mercurial day for cocoa futures Tuesday as prices jumped the fence of the unchanged mark back and forth numerous times before settling lower on the day Overall activity was dominated by indecisive locals and small speculators unsure about which position they should hold Locals in particular started liquidating their long holdings the inheritance of the previous sessions strength and shifted numerous times between the short and the long side but ended with empty pockets a trader said World sugar futures ended higher Tuesday as trade houses and endusers bought spurring small speculators and locals to cover shorts Funds were on both sides the market began to address the oversold status after losing a fourth of its value in recent weeks The Mar contract settled points higher at cents per pound and May closed up points at c Cotton futures settled moderately lower Tuesday rubbing out all of the previous sessions gains but

was subdued as cash trading in the February contract wrapped up today Most traders upon completion of their deals for February remained on the sidelines in no hurry to jump into the March contracts Light technical support came from ideas that the US economy has bottomed out and a recovery is beginning to take shape which should eventually manifest itself in higher energy demand later this year March crude oil extended its short covering rally on Friday closing at broken uptrend line support crossing near Multiple closes above this broken support level are needed before a double bottom can be confirmed Stochastics and the RSI are turning bullish with this weeks rebound increasing the odds that a low is in or near March heating oil closed modestly higher on Friday but failed to clear minor resistance marked by last weeks high crossing at Closes above this resistance level are needed to increase the odds that a shortterm bottom has been posted At the same time a number of shortterm momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that a bottom has likely been posted March unleaded gas closed higher on Friday retracing of this months decline this week While shortterm momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that a low has been posted I would not be surprised to see the market under some selling pressure on Monday as rising inventories and weak demand will likely limit upside potential nearterm Longerterm I am looking for March to work its way higher possibly testing the cent area by earlyFebruary March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher on Friday

respective overbought zones hinting that we could see additional pressure into earlyFebruary GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed fractionally lower on Friday despite a significant increase in this weeks export sales Weekly export sales came in at million bushels some above the previous weeks pace While the sales number was impressive spillover weakness from soybeans combined with a soaring US Dollar rendered the report mute by the close Todays downside reversal leaves the market vulnerable to additional weakness on Monday especially if the dry regions across southern Brazil receive much needed rain over the weekend From a broad perspective the corn market continues to carve out what appears to be a major bottom as longterm fundamentals indicate that prices are too cheap I suspect that the corn market will struggle to stay afloat into mid February when the midwinter low is due to be posted March wheat closed fractionally higher on Friday as much improved export sales this week helped to underpin todays rally Additional support came from extended weather forecasts for next week which are calling for significantly lower temperatures across the Plains that could burn back some

inside day with a higher close due to technical short covering as it consolidated some of its losses over the past four trading sessions Light support was due to the fact that Brazils Rio Grande do Sul state continues to miss forecasted rain events The extremely dry conditions of the past several weeks are beginning to diminish yield potential in this region of the country The state has lowered its yield projection from million metric tons to million metric tons and is down from last years level Gains were limited as weather forecasts continue to call for chances for rain over the next five

March remains poised to test Decembers reaction low crossing at possibly next Tuesday Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm I would not be

acreage estimate for this year at million acres up from last year The increased corn acreage projection trumped early expectations for a short covering rebound ahead of the threeday weekend However some analysts indicated that Sparks corn acreage estimate may be to million acres too high as actual acreage often falls below early planting estimates Nevertheless March corn fell below last years uptrend line leaving this weeks earlier breakout suspect for the time being The market will need to see increased export demand in the near future to limit the sell off from Thursdays high Nearterm downside risk appears limited to a test of minor support crossing at March wheat closed lower on Friday thereby confirming Thursdays trendline breakout and key reversal down The door is open for additional weakness and a likely test of Decembers uptrend line crossing near later this month Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible now that this

questions over Chinese demand ahead of March th and spillover weakness from meal Momentum indicators have become overbought warning traders that a round of long liquidation to consolidate some of this months gains might unfold into the latter part of January Marchs inability to test Novembers high at was noted by bears as they tied this fact with the idea that underlying support for the market has weakened this week I am looking for a breakout below Januarys uptrend line early next week and a likely setback to the area in the near future March soybean meal closed sharply lower due to profit taking ahead of the weekend on Friday following Thursdays test of the retracement level of the JulyJanuary decline which crosses at Todays sell off turned a number of momentum indicators which have

ahead of the threeday weekend Unless the near ideal weather pattern in Brazil shifts and or there is a major surprise over the size of Vietnams crop coffee prices are likely to remain under pressure

the extended weather forecast for the US The National Weather Service is now calling for above normal temps for much of the US over the next two weeks which will reduce the demand for heating oil and natural gas With abundant supplies and expectations for a continuation of weak demand look for sideways to lower prices in energies to continue nearterm March crude oil closed lower on Monday thereby signaling an end to the twoday short covering bounce off last Wednesdays low I would not be surprised to see subdued trading on Tuesday as traders await this weeks API inventory reports Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible during the first half of February However it is unlikely that March will breakout above the upper boundary of this winters trading range crossing at in the near future March heating oil closed sharply lower on Monday as the bearish reaction to the oilfield explosion in Kuwait last week faded Todays close below minor trading range resistance crossing at leaves the door open for sideways to lower trading on Tuesday ahead of this weeks API inventory reports The upturn by stochastics and the RSI signals that sideways to higher prices are possible during the first half of February March unleaded gas closed lower on Monday as the bullish reaction to last weeks oil explosion in Kuwait faded At the same time stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible during the first half of February however it is unlikely that Januarys high crossing at will be exceeded before contract expiration March Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Monday due in part to a bearish shift in the extended weather forecast for much of the nation over the next two weeks Nevertheless last weeks trendline breakout strongly suggested that a shortterm bottom has been posted Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible nearterm CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies The March Dollar closed sharply lower on Monday and below initial trendline support drawn across Januarys lows which crosses near While todays lowrange close leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening in access trading I would not be surprised to see a higher close on Tuesday due to short covering as March might try to consolidate some of its recent losses Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning bearish hinting that a top is in or near Closes below the previous reaction low crossing at would confirm that a top has been posted The March Swiss Franc closed higher Monday due to short covering Closes above last weeks high crossing at would confirm that a double bottom with Decembers low was posted last week while opening the door for a short covering rebound during the first half of February Todays rebound turned the daily ADX neutral from its bearish mode hinting that a low is in or near Additional strength this week would confirm a downturn by the ADX and that a double bottom has been posted The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Monday and in doing so turned a number of shortterm momentum indicators neutral to bearish Marchs inability to sustain last weeks breakout above Januarys high of is shortterm bearish although I would not be surprised to see a corrective bounce on Tuesday on ideas that todays sell off was somewhat overdone The March Japanese Yen closed higher on Monday and above last falls downtrend line crossing near and broken support at Multiple closes above these key price levels are needed to confirm todays upside breakout which would then open the door for a largerdegree rebound during at least the first half of February Initial fib resistance begins at PRECIOUS METALS exchangescmetals April gold closed sharply higher on Monday and above Januarys double top crossing at to renew its rally off Decembers low If the rebound continues the retracement level of last falls decline crossing at is Aprils next target If this resistance level is cleared last Septembers high crossing at is a potential target for April later this month Todays rally was triggered by weak equity markets that led to a flight to quality move on the part of some investors Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that additional strength is possible during the first half of February March silver posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday as it consolidated some of last Fridays short covering gains Closes above broken support crossing at are needed to signal that a shortterm bottom has been posted Momentum indicators are oversold signaling that additional short covering is possible this week If the decline off Januarys high resumes Decembers low crossing at is Marchs next target March copper closed lower on Monday due to light profit taking Early strength tested last Fridays high however when a lack of followthrough buying failed to materialize near session highs a sell off was triggered March continues to consolidate around Novembers high crossing at which marks key resistance If last weeks rally continues weekly fib resistance crossing at is Marchs next upside target Stochastics and the RSI are bullish but diverging warning bullish traders to use caution as a double top might be forming GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed higher on Monday due to short covering March was mostly steady in early trading as the weekly export inspection report came in at million bushels which was at the lowend of expectations Traders and analysts are still concerned that the USDA will be forced to cut its export projection of billion bushels this year possibly as early as this Fridays supplydemand report However others indicate that export demand should begin to pickup in the coming weeks The recent decline in the Dollar is helpful to corn exports however the Dollar will need to trade below Decembers low at to have a significant impact on export sales Technically March corn is holding above longterm support crossing at Momentum indicators are oversold but have not confirmed a bottom has been posted Closes above last summers downtrend line crossing near are needed to temper the nearterm bearish outlook in the market March wheat closed sharply lower on Monday and below minor support crossing at to renew its decline off Januarys high The door is open for a test of the December low crossing at later this week Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that Decembers low is within reach of the market Much of todays selling was due to fund selling of some contracts due to a combination of slow export sales of soft red winter wheat bearish seasonal trends and last weeks beneficial moisture event This mornings export inspection report came in at million bushels which was inline with expectations Unless there is a marked decline in the strong US Dollar to make US wheat more competitive on the world market wheat will remain under pressure as it searches for a price level that will trigger new foreign buying SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans closed sharply higher on Monday due to technical short covering which confirmed last weeks breakout above Januarys downtrend line Todays close above last weeks reaction high crossing at tempers the near term bearish outlook in the market Todays rally was triggered by a combination of fresh news out of Washington regarding possible changes in the soybean loan rate the bank holiday in Argentina and renewed dryness in Southern Brazil However I would not put too much stock in todays rally from a bullish standpoint as it was mostly technical Buy stops above last weeks high helped to exaggerate todays rally which appears to have been overdone thereby leaving the door open for a possible setback in turnaround Tuesday market action It will take closes above the reaction high crossing at to increase the odds that the February low has been posted Todays rally did turn a number of shortterm momentum indicators neutral to bullish hinting that last weeks lows should not be taken out anytime soon March soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close on Monday due to short covering triggered by spillover strength from soybeans Additional support came from strong livestock prices and a return to more normal like winter weather conditions which should support higher domestic demand if only for a few weeks Closes above last weeks high crossing at are needed to temper the nearterm bearish outlook in the market Stochastics and the RSI are still bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible nearterm LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock April hogs spiked to a new contract high in early trading before profit taking led to a lower close on the day Additional pressure came from mixed cash signals with calls for steady bids on Tuesday and apprehension ahead of the weekly pork belly storage movement report on Tuesday Slaughter weights are light enough that producers can wait out packers for a brief period of time as they try to break cash bids in an attempt to shore up shrinking profit margins Technically this months rally to new contract highs has set the stage for a likely test of the next level of longterm resistance crossing at possibly later this week Stochastics along with a number of other short term momentum indicators are bullish hinting that we could see one more drive to new highs during the first half of February before a top is posted April cattle closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to profit taking ahead of the close Early strength led to a spike above the retracement level of last years decline crossing at If this resistance level is cleared the bottom of last summers trading range crossing at is a potential target later this month Momentum indicators are overbought and turning neutral warning bulls that time is no longer on their side Closes below last Fridays reaction low crossing at would open the door for additional profit taking and a likely test of last falls uptrend line crossing near Closes below this support level are needed before a major top can be confirmed FOOD FIBER exchangescfood March coffee closed slightly higher on Monday but near session lows Early support was due to spillover short covering following last Fridays upside reversal However Marchs inability to close above last weeks high crossing at along with todays lowrange close leaves the door open for sideways to lower prices on Tuesday Momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a low might be in or near However closes above todays high crossing at are needed before this is confirmed March cocoa closed sharply higher on Monday due to the exercise of March options and a combination of speculative and trade short covering At the same time there were no new developments in the current supplydemand situation which leaves the market vulnerable to a setback on Tuesday Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into midFebruary If the rebound continues Januarys high crossing at is Marchs next target Closes above this resistance level would confirm an upside breakout of this winters trading range thereby renewing its rally off last summers low March sugar posted an outside day down with a lower close on Monday as it is poised to test last Octobers low crossing at possibly later this week Much of todays selling pressure was fund related as they added to their net short positions Additional pressure was due to the markets focus on the expected huge Brazilian cane crop which begins harvest in May Momentum indicators have entered their respective oversold zones but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm March cotton closed higher on Monday as it extended last Fridays short covering gains Additional support was due to improving world cotton prices and expectations for a rebound in the US economy during the first half of this year However March cotton will remain range bound until reduced planted acreage is confirmed and further signals of global economic recovery surface A sell off late in the day tempered some of todays gains leaving the door open for a possible setback on Tuesday Closes above Januarys high crossing at would open the door for a possible test

extend last Fridays rally despite news of Egypts purchase of metric tonnes of hard winter wheat is bearish Stochastics are overbought and warns of a possible setback later this week Closes below last Fridays low crossing at would confirm that a shortterm top has been posted At the same time losses are likely to be limited following last Fridays bullish acreage report which showed the smallest planted acreage since SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans gapped up and closed higher on Monday due in large part to a lack of rain across southern Brazil Additional early support came from todays bullish export inspection report which came in at million bushels and sharply higher soybean meal prices Profit taking ahead of the close tempered much of todays early gains and leaves the door open for a possible setback on Tuesday where March might try to fill todays gap at At the same time downside risk at least for this week appears limited due to rumors of impending purchases by China in the very near future Stochastics and the RSI remain bullish signaling that a test of Novembers high crossing at is possible later this month March soybean meal gapped up and closed sharply higher on Monday as it spiked above the retracement level of the JulyJanuary decline which crosses at Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of todays gain leaving the door for additional

March coffee closed higher on Monday due to speculator buying Early weakness pushed March below gap support crossing at However the push lower failed to trigger sell stops which forced weak shorts to

high could lead to a test of weekly resistance crossing at later this year GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed higher due to short covering on Monday However a sell off ahead of the close tempered some of todays gains which led to a lowrange close This low range close leaves the door open for a possible setback on Tuesday amidst a lack of fresh supportive news Export inspections were once again disappointing due in part to last weeks holiday Corn inspections were just million bushels The pace is going to have to see a significant pickup in the near future for the market to come anywhere close to USDAs export target for this year I would not be surprised to see some additional short covering this week as traders position themselves ahead of the January crop and supply demand reports due out Friday morning March wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Monday as is consolidated some of last Fridays gains and breakout above the upper boundary of its weekly trading range crossing at Tightening US stocks along with a severe contraction in world ending stocks over the past few years leaves the wheat market in a bullish setup Sources indicate that this years planted acreage will not see a significant increase from last year which leaves the market in position to build a weather premium on any perceived supply disruptions Multiple closes above weekly resistance crossing at and the retracement level of last years decline which crosses at would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a largerdegree rebound during January At the same time

factoring in any likely friendly news out of Fridays report into prices already SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans gapped up and closed higher on Monday as disappointing weekend showers

could push prices well above Novembers high crossing at later this winter March soybean meal closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to a latesession sell off after early strength which led to a spike above this falls downtrend line failed to attract followthrough buying March meal is at a crossroads as it has become oversold with last weeks test of key support crossing at Closes below

leaves the door open for a short covering bounce on Tuesday February hogs need to close below Decembers uptrend line to confirm a top and trend change has taken place Momentum indicators have turned bearish from overbought conditions thereby increasing the odds that sideways to lower prices are possible into the later part of January February cattle posted an inside day with a higher close as it consolidated below Decembers broken uptrend line Todays highrange close leaves the door open for a steady to firmer opening on Tuesday however the door has been opened for lower prices with last weeks

on prices The lowrange close leaves the door open for followthrough selling on Tuesday Closes above or below are needed to clear up nearterm direction in the market March cocoa closed higher on Monday

market into oversold territory I would not be surprised to see more of a downside correction soon Prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high Tuesday Resistance lies at the level First support lies at the level August feeder cattle closed off today at Prices scored an inside day and took a rest after they hit a new contract high Tuesday Feeders are still overextended on a shortterm technical basis A bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart as this week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern First resistance is seen at Looking at the weekly continuation chart for nearby futures the next upside objective for the bulls is resistance just above First support is seen at August lean hogs closed up today at Prices closed near the session high The strong rebound continued today after limitup gains seen Tuesday The market just got too extended on the downside especially in the wake Fridays bullish USDA Hogs Pigs report Fund buying was featured today sources said Prices today broke out above and negated a steep fiveweekold downtrend The bulls now have the nearterm edge However I would not be surprised to see some sideways consolidation in the coming sessions Next resistance lies at First support is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed up cent at today It was a quiet rest day today after prices Tuesday scored another fresh contract low Funds have loaded up on the short side now Good growing weather in the Midwest and no threatening weather patterns in the forecast continue This market has no summertime weather premium built into it which will make it very susceptible to an upside spurt even with a minor weather scare I dont think there is much downside left in corn but I dont want to be a bottompicker eithertempting as it may be at these low prices Next support is seen at Next resistance is seen at July soybeans closed cents lower at today Technical damage occurred in the market this week as a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated Now it also looks like a minor doubletop reversal pattern could be playing out on the daily bar chart Good growing weather and no weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take control of this market Funds have been good sellers in the bean pit this week Still more downside action this week would not surprise me First support is seen at the area First resistance is now seen at level July soybean meal closed off at today Another down day today negates a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart Bears are gaining steam now After prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high Friday they have seen a solid downside correction this week Bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will quickly become more than a downside correction Next support comes in at the area First resistance is seen at todays high July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Todays followthrough buying has confirmed a key reversal up after prices pushed to a fresh contract low on Tuesday and then staged a strong rebound This week spreaders are unwinding short oil and long meal positions Oil is still technically much weaker than beans or meal But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat closed cents lower at today Prices closed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand prospects Earlier in the session prices were boosted by heavy storms that hit Kansas and Oklahoma the past hours First support lies at the levelthe contract low Next resistance is seen at KC July HRW wheat closed up cent at today Prices gapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of the Plains the past hours However prices closed on the session low Still the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat Also there was followthrough buying today and a key reversal up on the daily bar chart was confirmed Recently this market has seen a series of V reversalsboth up and down Trading remains volatile Next resistance is seen at the level Next support is seen at July oats closed up cent at today Prices closed near the session low today as did wheat The choppy activity at lower price levels also favors the bulls The past three weeks have seen another minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart Oats will continue to look to corn and wheat for direction Next resistance comes in at the level First support now comes in at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today Prices today dropped to another fresh fourweek low as the recent higher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish Also the rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play out on the daily bar chart Bears have the technical edge at present However the market is overdone on the downside at present on a technical basis Next support comes in at centstodays low First resistance is now seen at centstodays high July NY coffee closed points lower at cents today Prices today came within points of the contract low set in April Bears rule Bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price level which would signal a big doublebottom reversal Still given the upcoming frost season in South America I suspect the downside from present levels will be limited in the coffee market Speculative shortplayers wont want to get too brave at this time of year First support comes in at the contract low of cents First resistance is now seen at cents July NY cocoa closed lower today at More technical damage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh threeweek low as there was followthrough selling from Fridays gaplower trade The bears are in control but the market is shortterm overdone on the downside at present Next support comes in at First resistance is now seen at todays high July cotton closed points lower at cents today Prices hit a fresh contract low just yesterday in the wake of a bearish USDA cotton consumption report last Friday Cotton is in a strong bear market and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the bearsfor now My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next support lies at centsthe contract low First resistance is seen around cents Recently I put December New York cotton futures on my Radar Screen for a potential longside trade in the coming weeks But first and importantly this market has to me show solid strength including some basing activity at these lower levels July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Trading has turned volatile lately but it still favors the bullish camp Bulls pushed prices to a fresh threemonth high just last Friday Prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar chartalbeit a choppy one Next resistance is now seen at cents Next support now comes in at cents July lumber futures closed the limit of lower today at What goes up must come down A VTop reversal is playing out in lumber I still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are over The market was way overdone on the upside and this still could be just a big correction before stillhigher highs are scored Expect more volatility in the near termon the upside and downside The next upside objective for the bulls is the level First support is seen at METALS August COMEX gold futures plummeted by to an ounce Heavy long liquidation and stoploss selling were featured in the pit The recent Commitments of Traders report showed the small speculators had loaded up on the long side of gold futures recently Today those weak longs were coughing up their positions News wire reports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices Technically once gold dropped to near the level basis August COMEX futures the door was open for stoploss selling and general long liquidation A big VTop reversal has now formed and played out on the daily bar chart Pit reports said there was not much fresh short selling interest Wednesday Once again the gold bulls mustered the strength to show an impressive upside move only to be kicked in the teeth when a lack of followthrough buying interest at higher levels prompted a price vacuum on the downside There is a support level around the area basis August futures If that level gives way then the next support comes in at the area This market is now shortterm oversold on a technical basis Next resistance on the upside is seen at the area For bulls to really get back on their feet they must push prices back above the level If volatility persists it will favor the bulls July silver closed off today at an ounce Like gold long liquidation and stoploss selling hit silver today and it was prompted by the sell of in gold Prices have now backed well off last weeks high and could be forming a VTop reversal on the daily bar chart Bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that saw prices push to a threemonth high Still the recent increase in volatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver Next support is seen at First resistance is now seen at July NY copper closed off points today at cents The sell off in the precious metals has impacted copper this week While this deals the bulls a nearterm setback the higher volatility at lower levels does favor the bulls My bias is still that the lows are in place for copper Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed off at today Prices this week are correcting from the big beating they took late last week Bears still have the edge and in fact a bearish flag or pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart Next resistance is seen at Next support lies at July heating oil closed points lower today at Prices are still correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh eightmonth high Bulls still have the edge Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today Prices closed near the session low as the bears gain confidence A rare and usually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar chart This increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at July natural gas closed cents higher at today Prices today saw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition The market is still oversold on a shortterm technical basis Prices hit a fresh ninemonth low just Tuesday Bears still have the big advantage Next support is seen at todays low First resistance is seen at STOCKS FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points higher at today Bears are in control as prices hover near the recent forthemove low In fact a bearish pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart Measuring implications of that pattern should a downside breakout occur point to losses to the area Bulls only hope is that last weeks low of can hold the losses Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last Thursday and are this week consolidating those recent gains The recent push higher moved prices out above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two and onehalf months Bulls still need to show some more upside strength before I am confident in calling this an upside breakout Next resistance now lies at the level First support is now seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points higher at today Like the Euro bulls want to see last weeks low hold up before they can gain any momentum at all And like the Euro a bearish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart Measuring implications on a confirmation of the pattern point to losses to the area A monthold accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart Next support is seen at the levellast weeks low First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh month high last week and bulls can argue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week Still downside price action last week penetrated on the downside and negated a sevenweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart Bulls should be worried about this They need to show some fresh momentum soon First support is seen at First resistance is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Prices closed near the session low If prices drop below the May low of then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside In fact a wedge pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart that if confirmed would likely favor the bulls Next resistance is seen at the level First support is now seen at the level The June British pound closed points higher at Prices are rebounding after last Thursday prices fell below the early April low of If there would have been followthrough selling then the door would have been open to steeper losses If the losses can be contained and prices rebound one could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north Next resistance is seen at the level Next support now comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Bulls are still in firm control In fact a bullish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart The index last week pushed to a fresh multimonth high If bulls can push prices above and have a close above the level then there is likely significantly more upside potential to this rally even though the index is still a bit shortterm overbought technically There is stiff resistance basis the longerterm charts at the area Next resistance lies at the area First support is seen at the area September US Tbonds closed higher today at The market is consolidating at lower levels Bears still rule The next upside objective for the bulls is the par level even But any nearterm rebound will be corrective in nature only until prices can push above the area Prices pushed to a sixmonth low just recently First support at The September US Tnote closed up nds today at Prices fell to a multimonth low just recently as bears rule Severe technical damage has been inflicted recently First support is seen at the level First resistance is seen at level September Nasdaq futures closed lower at today Bulls are losing technical ground that they had gained recently with the push above the level It just shows how the stock indexes will not let either the bulls or the bears have much of an edge before prices reverse First resistance is now seen at First support is seen at the area September SP futures closed lower at We are seeing some consolidation the past few days after prices hit a fresh

market into oversold territory I would not be surprised to see more of a downside correction soon Prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high Tuesday Resistance lies at the level First support lies at the level August feeder cattle closed off today at Prices scored an inside day and took a rest after they hit a new contract high Tuesday Feeders are still overextended on a shortterm technical basis A bull flag looks to be forming on the daily bar chart as this week we saw an upside breakout from that pattern First resistance is seen at Looking at the weekly continuation chart for nearby futures the next upside objective for the bulls is resistance just above First support is seen at August lean hogs closed up today at Prices closed near the session high The strong rebound continued today after limitup gains seen Tuesday The market just got too extended on the downside especially in the wake Fridays bullish USDA Hogs Pigs report Fund buying was featured today sources said Prices today broke out above and negated a steep fiveweekold downtrend The bulls now have the nearterm edge However I would not be surprised to see some sideways consolidation in the coming sessions Next resistance lies at First support is located at the level GRAINS July corn futures closed up cent at today It was a quiet rest day today after prices Tuesday scored another fresh contract low Funds have loaded up on the short side now Good growing weather in the Midwest and no threatening weather patterns in the forecast continue This market has no summertime weather premium built into it which will make it very susceptible to an upside spurt even with a minor weather scare I dont think there is much downside left in corn but I dont want to be a bottompicker eithertempting as it may be at these low prices Next support is seen at Next resistance is seen at July soybeans closed cents lower at today Technical damage occurred in the market this week as a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated Now it also looks like a minor doubletop reversal pattern could be playing out on the daily bar chart Good growing weather and no weather threats on the horizon have allowed the bears to take control of this market Funds have been good sellers in the bean pit this week Still more downside action this week would not surprise me First support is seen at the area First resistance is now seen at level July soybean meal closed off at today Another down day today negates a fiveweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart Bears are gaining steam now After prices pushed to a fresh fourmonth high Friday they have seen a solid downside correction this week Bulls need to stop the bleeding soon or this weakness will quickly become more than a downside correction Next support comes in at the area First resistance is seen at todays high July bean oil closed points higher at cents today Todays followthrough buying has confirmed a key reversal up after prices pushed to a fresh contract low on Tuesday and then staged a strong rebound This week spreaders are unwinding short oil and long meal positions Oil is still technically much weaker than beans or meal But I would be surprised if there is much downside left in oil Next resistance comes in at cents Next support is seen at cents July Chicago wheat closed cents lower at today Prices closed near the session low as traders looked at slack demand prospects Earlier in the session prices were boosted by heavy storms that hit Kansas and Oklahoma the past hours First support lies at the levelthe contract low Next resistance is seen at KC July HRW wheat closed up cent at today Prices gapped higher today in the wake of the heavy storms that hit parts of the Plains the past hours However prices closed on the session low Still the upside gap was not filled with the late retreat Also there was followthrough buying today and a key reversal up on the daily bar chart was confirmed Recently this market has seen a series of V reversalsboth up and down Trading remains volatile Next resistance is seen at the level Next support is seen at July oats closed up cent at today Prices closed near the session low today as did wheat The choppy activity at lower price levels also favors the bulls The past three weeks have seen another minor uptrend develop on the daily bar chart Oats will continue to look to corn and wheat for direction Next resistance comes in at the level First support now comes in at SOFTS July NY sugar closed points lower at cents today Prices today dropped to another fresh fourweek low as the recent higher volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish Also the rare and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play out on the daily bar chart Bears have the technical edge at present However the market is overdone on the downside at present on a technical basis Next support comes in at centstodays low First resistance is now seen at centstodays high July NY coffee closed points lower at cents today Prices today came within points of the contract low set in April Bears rule Bulls can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price level which would signal a big doublebottom reversal Still given the upcoming frost season in South America I suspect the downside from present levels will be limited in the coffee market Speculative shortplayers wont want to get too brave at this time of year First support comes in at the contract low of cents First resistance is now seen at cents July NY cocoa closed lower today at More technical damage was inflicted by the bears today as prices hit another fresh threeweek low as there was followthrough selling from Fridays gaplower trade The bears are in control but the market is shortterm overdone on the downside at present Next support comes in at First resistance is now seen at todays high July cotton closed points lower at cents today Prices hit a fresh contract low just yesterday in the wake of a bearish USDA cotton consumption report last Friday Cotton is in a strong bear market and any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the bearsfor now My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process Next support lies at centsthe contract low First resistance is seen around cents Recently I put December New York cotton futures on my Radar Screen for a potential longside trade in the coming weeks But first and importantly this market has to me show solid strength including some basing activity at these lower levels July orange juice futures closed points higher today at cents Trading has turned volatile lately but it still favors the bullish camp Bulls pushed prices to a fresh threemonth high just last Friday Prices are still in an uptrend on the daily bar chartalbeit a choppy one Next resistance is now seen at cents Next support now comes in at cents July lumber futures closed the limit of lower today at What goes up must come down A VTop reversal is playing out in lumber I still would be surprised if the upside fireworks are over The market was way overdone on the upside and this still could be just a big correction before stillhigher highs are scored Expect more volatility in the near termon the upside and downside The next upside objective for the bulls is the level First support is seen at METALS August COMEX gold futures plummeted by to an ounce Heavy long liquidation and stoploss selling were featured in the pit The recent Commitments of Traders report showed the small speculators had loaded up on the long side of gold futures recently Today those weak longs were coughing up their positions News wire reports could offer no fundamental reason for the collapse in prices Technically once gold dropped to near the level basis August COMEX futures the door was open for stoploss selling and general long liquidation A big VTop reversal has now formed and played out on the daily bar chart Pit reports said there was not much fresh short selling interest Wednesday Once again the gold bulls mustered the strength to show an impressive upside move only to be kicked in the teeth when a lack of followthrough buying interest at higher levels prompted a price vacuum on the downside There is a support level around the area basis August futures If that level gives way then the next support comes in at the area This market is now shortterm oversold on a technical basis Next resistance on the upside is seen at the area For bulls to really get back on their feet they must push prices back above the level If volatility persists it will favor the bulls July silver closed off today at an ounce Like gold long liquidation and stoploss selling hit silver today and it was prompted by the sell of in gold Prices have now backed well off last weeks high and could be forming a VTop reversal on the daily bar chart Bulls today lost much of their momentum they had gained that saw prices push to a threemonth high Still the recent increase in volatility is suggestive of a bottoming process in silver Next support is seen at First resistance is now seen at July NY copper closed off points today at cents The sell off in the precious metals has impacted copper this week While this deals the bulls a nearterm setback the higher volatility at lower levels does favor the bulls My bias is still that the lows are in place for copper Next support is seen at cents Next resistance is seen at cents ENERGIES July crude closed off at today Prices this week are correcting from the big beating they took late last week Bears still have the edge and in fact a bearish flag or pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart Next resistance is seen at Next support lies at July heating oil closed points lower today at Prices are still correcting downward after they last week hit a fresh eightmonth high Bulls still have the edge Next resistance is seen at cents Next support is seen at cents July unleaded gasoline closed points lower at today Prices closed near the session low as the bears gain confidence A rare and usually bearish broadening formation is developing on the daily bar chart This increase in volatility at higher price levels suggests a topping process in the market Next resistance is seen at First support is seen at July natural gas closed cents higher at today Prices today saw a decent rebound from a technically oversold condition The market is still oversold on a shortterm technical basis Prices hit a fresh ninemonth low just Tuesday Bears still have the big advantage Next support is seen at todays low First resistance is seen at STOCKS FINANCIALS CURRENCIES The June Euro currency closed points higher at today Bears are in control as prices hover near the recent forthemove low In fact a bearish pennant pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart Measuring implications of that pattern should a downside breakout occur point to losses to the area Bulls only hope is that last weeks low of can hold the losses Next support is now seen at Next resistance is seen at The June Japanese yen closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh twomonth high last Thursday and are this week consolidating those recent gains The recent push higher moved prices out above the congestion area that had trapped prices for about two and onehalf months Bulls still need to show some more upside strength before I am confident in calling this an upside breakout Next resistance now lies at the level First support is now seen at the level The June Swiss franc closed points higher at today Like the Euro bulls want to see last weeks low hold up before they can gain any momentum at all And like the Euro a bearish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart Measuring implications on a confirmation of the pattern point to losses to the area A monthold accelerating downtrend line is in place on the daily bar chart Next support is seen at the levellast weeks low First resistance comes in at the level The June Australian dollar futures closed points lower at today Prices pushed to a fresh month high last week and bulls can argue we are seeing corrective consolidation this week Still downside price action last week penetrated on the downside and negated a sevenweekold uptrend line on the daily bar chart Bulls should be worried about this They need to show some fresh momentum soon First support is seen at First resistance is now seen at The June Canadian dollar closed points lower today at Prices closed near the session low If prices drop below the May low of then bears will be on a level playing field with the bulls This currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside In fact a wedge pattern may be forming on the daily bar chart that if confirmed would likely favor the bulls Next resistance is seen at the level First support is now seen at the level The June British pound closed points higher at Prices are rebounding after last Thursday prices fell below the early April low of If there would have been followthrough selling then the door would have been open to steeper losses If the losses can be contained and prices rebound one could still argue that price action the past few weeks has been a basing before prices eventually turn north Next resistance is seen at the level Next support now comes in at the level The June US dollar index closed points higher at today Bulls are still in firm control In fact a bullish pennant pattern could be forming on the daily bar chart The index last week pushed to a fresh multimonth high If bulls can push prices above and have a close above the level then there is likely significantly more upside potential to this rally even though the index is still a bit shortterm overbought technically There is stiff resistance basis the longerterm charts at the area Next resistance lies at the area First support is seen at the area September US Tbonds closed higher today at The market is consolidating at lower levels Bears still rule The next upside objective for the bulls is the par level even But any nearterm rebound will be corrective in nature only until prices can push above the area Prices pushed to a sixmonth low just recently First support at The September US Tnote closed up nds today at Prices fell to a multimonth low just recently as bears rule Severe technical damage has been inflicted recently First support is seen at the level First resistance is seen at level September Nasdaq futures closed lower at today Bulls are losing technical ground that they had gained recently with the push above the level It just shows how the stock indexes will not let either the bulls or the bears have much of an edge before prices reverse First resistance is now seen at First support is seen at the area September SP futures closed lower at We are seeing some consolidation the past few days after prices hit a fresh threemonth high last week Bulls are still encouraged by the continuing uptrend off the March low but they do need to stop the slide lower seen the past few sessions My bias is still that any recovery

closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend as investors chose to digest todays economic data Losses were limited as a number of Wall Street firms upgraded Computer Sciences after the company delivered thirdquarter earnings above expectations Additional support came from Adobe Systems as its first quarter earnings were upgraded from cents to cents The NASDAQ closed down points at The March SP index also closed lower on Friday closing down points at The Dow closed slightly lower on Friday as investors took profits while digesting todays economic data While unemployment dropped by a closer look at the data showed that there were fewer people in accounted for in the job market which distorted todays data Technically todays sell off appears to be a correction of the gains of the previous two sessions Losses were limited due to a solid performance by Walt Disney which reported first quarter earnings well ahead of expectations INTEREST RATES exchangescinterest March Tbonds closed higher on Friday posting a key reversal up to signal an end to the twoday correction off this weeks high The stage is set for a possible run at Januarys high crossing at early next week Much of todays support was due to weakness in the equity markets after digesting this mornings economic news which was less supportive than initially though Stochastics and the RSI are turning neutral to bullish with Fridays rally hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible next week The CRB INDEX exchangescindexes The CRB index closed sharply higher on Friday supported by strength in hogs bellies precious metals fiber some foods and energies Todays rally confirmed Thursdays upside reversal and sets the stage for a test of Mondays high crossing at If this minor resistance level is cleared Januarys downtrend line which coincides with the retracement level of last months decline crossing at is the CRBs next target Shortterm momentum indicators are oversold but turned bullish with todays rally thereby increasing the odds that a shortterm bottom has likely been posted ENERGY MARKETS exchangescenergy The energy markets closed sharply higher on Friday in a kneejerk reaction to news that Kuwait has lost production of barrels per day due to a fire at its Rawdatian oil field on Thursday However Kuwait indicated that there will be no shortage as oil from stockpiles will replaced the halted production until its other oil fields can raise their production to compensate for this loss March crude oil posted a new high close for the week on Friday thereby renewing its rebound off the midJanuary low Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible during the first half of February Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm todays breakout above the previous reaction high If todays breakout is confirmed the door would be opened for a possible test of the upper boundary of this winters trading range crossing at later this month March heating oil closed sharply higher on Friday in reaction to the oilfield explosion in Kuwait on Thursday Todays close above minor trading range resistance crossing at confirms that a triple bottom was posted with Wednesdays low while opening the door for additional short covering during the first half of February Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible nearterm Longerterm I am looking for a possible test of the double top crossing at March unleaded gas closed into new highs for the week on Friday Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm todays breakout above the previous reaction high crossing at Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible Longerterm I am looking for a possible test of Januarys high crossing at March Henry Hub natural gas closed steady on Friday but remains above this winters initial downtrend line crossing near Closes above broken support crossing at are needed to confirm this weeks trendline breakout which would then open the door for a largerdegree rebound during February Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible nearterm CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies The March Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close thereby ending the bounce off Wednesdays low However it will take closes below this weeks low crossing at and then initial trendline support crossing at to confirm that a shortterm top has been posted Until then the door remains open for a possible test of weekly resistance crossing at later this winter Stochastics and the RSI are very overbought and turning neutral hinting that a top is in or near On the weekly chart the Dollar is forming a potential double top The March Swiss Franc posted an inside day with a higher close due to light short covering ahead of the weekend as it consolidated some of this weeks losses Nevertheless the door remains open for a test of Decembers low crossing at in the near future The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible while momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a double bottom might be forming The March Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend Todays sell off left Thursdays key reversal up unconfirmed If the rally resumes next week fib resistance crossing at is Marchs next target The March Japanese Yen posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday due to short covering ahead of the weekend Until March closes above last falls downtrend line and broken support at the door remains open for additional weakness nearterm If the decline continues next week longterm support crossing at is Marchs next target PRECIOUS METALS exchangescmetals February gold closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering triggered by weakness in the equity markets and a lower Dollar February posted its highest close since January th Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of todays gains leaving the door open for a possible inside day on Monday However stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that a test of Januarys double top at is possible in the near future March silver closed higher on Friday due to short covering following Thursdays spike of the retracement level of the NovemberJanuary rally crossing at Closes above broken support crossing at are needed to signal that a shortterm bottom has been posted Momentum indicators are oversold signaling that additional short covering is possible early next week March copper extended Thursdays rally today spiking above Novembers high crossing at before light profit taking ahead of the close trimmed gains Rising optimism over the countries economic outlook triggered Thursdays short covering rally which was exaggerated as buy stops were triggered on the way up Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible nearterm If the rally continues during the first half of February weekly fib resistance crossing at is Marchs next upside target GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed lower on Friday as it spiked below weekly support crossing at amidst a lack of supportive news If this longterm support level fails to halt the decline psychological support crossing at is Marchs next downside target Shortterm momentum indicators are bearish but have entered their respective oversold zones hinting that a low might be near This suggests that we could see the February low come early in the month especially if we get a setback in the US Dollar With little incentive for foreign buyers or end users to extend coverage much past days at least until we get into early spring prices are likely to drift sideways to lower ahead of the February supplydemand report March wheat closed fractionally higher on Friday as it continues to consolidate just above minor support crossing at If this support level fails to halt this months decline a test of the December low crossing at is likely by earlyFebruary Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible into early February The decline off Januarys high has seen funds liquidate their long positions just as the seasonal trends begin to turn bearish This leaves the door open for lower prices during February if funds decide to build a short position in wheat SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it closed out the week consolidating above the retracement level of Januarys rally crossing at Lack of supportive news and early harvest beginning in portions of Northern Brazil erased Thursdays gains Momentum indicators are becoming oversold but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible during the first half of February I would not be surprised to see March soybeans try and test Januarys low crossing at to post a possible double bottom on the daily chart before the February low has likely been posted The market has largely ignored this weeks strong export pace of US soybeans as it has chosen to focus on the bearish aspects of another record South American crop The market dynamics have changed significantly over the past four years to where end users and importing countries always have an abundant supply of new soybeans every six months This fact alone have shifted their buying pattern to hand to mouth while giving them little reason to build much of a weather premium into prices March soybean meal posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday amidst a lack of supportive news Todays close below minor fib support has opened the door for a possible test of gap support crossing at possibly next week Shortterm momentum indicators signal that sideways to lower prices are likely during the first half of February I would not rule out the possibility of March meal testing this winters low at before the February low is posted later this month LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock April hogs closed into new contract highs on Friday amidst steady to higher cash bids Todays new contract high confirmed that bulls have regained control of the market Additional strength next week could lead to a test of weekly resistance crossing at Shortterm momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish with todays rally indicating that we should see one more leg up in this winters rally April cattle gapped down on the open but quickly turned higher and filled the opening gap after followthrough selling failed to materialize However profit taking ahead of this afternoons cattle inventory report pressured the market into the close as April remains below the retracement level of last years decline which crosses at This afternoons inventory report showed that total cowcalf inventory was at of year ago levels at million head The calf crop came in at of year ago levels at million head This report was inline with prereport estimates and should not be a major factor in Mondays trading If this winters rally resumes on Monday and clears fib resistance crossing at the bottom of last summers trading range crossing at is a potential target later this winter Momentum indicators are bullish but diverging warning bulls that a shortterm top might be near Closes below initial trendline support crossing near would signal that a shortterm top has likely been posted FOOD FIBER exchangescfood March coffee gapped down on the open due to renewed fund selling However a lack of followthrough selling triggered a short covering rebound which led to an upside reversal on the day Closes above this weeks high at would increase the odds that a shortterm bottom might have been posted with todays spike low as momentum indicators are very oversold March cocoa closed slightly higher on Friday in lackluster trading as it continues to correct more in time than price indicating that supplydemand fundamental are evenly matched for the time being Close above or below are needed to confirm a breakout of this winters trading range and point the direction of the next trending move March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as it tried to consolidate some of this weeks losses and breakout below Novembers reaction low crossing at However the door is open for a test of last Octobers low crossing at possibly next week Momentum indicators have entered their respective oversold zones but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm March cotton gapped up and closed sharply higher on Friday as a higher than expected opening call triggered aggressive early trade buying Buy stops above the market were tripped which exaggerated todays rebound although a shortterm bottom was confirmed by the rally Stochastics along with other momentum indicators turned bullish today signaling that

exchangescindexes Stock indexes closed higher on Wednesday in a delayed reaction to the Feds decision to leave interest rates unchanged for now The market interpreted this inaction on the part of the Fed as a sign that economic recovery is beginning At the same time gains were limited as investors remain suspicious about accounting irregularities in business following the Enron debacle The NASDAQ fell short of testing the retracement level of the September January rally crossing at before a short covering rally triggered by a delayed response to todays decision by the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged pulled the index into positive territory on the day The NASDAQ closed up points at The March SP index also closed higher on Wednesday after spiking below the retracement level of the SeptemberJanuary rally crossing at Additional strength on Thursday is needed to confirm todays upside reversal thereby increasing the odds that a short term bottom has been posted The March SP closed up points at The Dow posted an upside reversal on Wednesday and closed above broken fib support crossing at However closes above Mondays high at are needed to temper the nearterm bearish outlook in the Dow Todays rally was in reaction to the Feds decision to leave interest rates unchanged for the time being which indicates that it believes a recovery has begun in the economy Solid gains in Home Depot WalMart Honeywell and IBM led the latesession rally in the Dow INTEREST RATES exchangescinterest March Tbonds closed lower on Wednesday following the Feds decision to leave interest rates unchanged in todays FOMC meeting However the Fed left its easing bias in place should further stimulus be needed to shore up the economy The lateday sell off sets the stage for additional weakness in access trading that could lead to a test of broken trendline resistance crossing near on Thursday Shortterm momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible nearterm as the market is caught between business accounting concerns and prospects for an improving economy The CRB INDEX exchangescindexes The CRB index closed lower on Wednesday pressured by weakness in grains some precious metals fiber and energies The CRB index is closing in on the retracement level of the OctoberJanuary rally which crosses at If this support level fails to halt this months decline the door would be open for a possible test of last falls low crossing at later this winter Shortterm momentum indicators are oversold but indicate that additional weakness is possible nearterm However weekly indicators are on the verge of rolling over which would increase the odds that the CRB could ultimately breakout below the double bottom on the monthly chart later this year ENERGY MARKETS exchangescenergy The energy markets closed lower on Wednesday following the release of this weeks API inventory reports which were termed bearish Crude oil stocks rose by barrels last week as total stocks are now some above yearago levels Gasoline stocks rose by million barrels although distillate stocks including heating oil fell by barrels but supplies are still above year ago levels Traders will be closely watching this weeks DOE inventory report for corroboration of rising energy inventories The AGA inventory report for natural gas will be released later today March crude oil closed sharply lower on Wednesday and below minor trendline support thereby confirming that a shortterm top was posted on Monday The door is open for a possible challenge of Januarys low crossing at in early February Closes below this support level could lead to an eventual test of Novembers low crossing at later this winter Momentum indicators such as stochastics and the RSI are turning bearish with this week setback hinting that a test of fall lows is possible later this year March heating oil closed lower on Wednesday following Tuesdays mildly bearish inventory report Todays low fell short of testing the lower boundary of this winters trading range crossing at Closes below this support level would confirm a range breakout and could lead to a test of weekly support crossing at later this winter Stochastics and the RSI have turned bearish with this weeks sell off signaling that we could see a spike to new contract lows before a low is posted March unleaded gas extended this weeks sell off on Wednesday following Tuesdays bearish API inventory report Todays sell off sets the stage for a possible test of last falls uptrend line crossing near Closes below this support level would open the door for a possible challenge of last falls low crossing at later this winter Stochastics and the RSI are turning bearish once again and signals that a new low for the year is possible in the near future March Henry Hub natural gas closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to short covering ahead of the release of todays AGA inventory report This weeks AGA inventory report showed a draw of bcf last week as US working gas in storage is full Traders are calling the report bearish However the sell off from midJanuary has already discounted some of this bearish news A higher close on Thursday would confirm this analysis while leaving the door open for a possible short covering bounce into early February If the decline continues weekly support crossing at is Marchs next target later this winter CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies The March Dollar posted an upside reversal on Wednesday thereby ending the oneday setback off Mondays high The door remains open for a resumption of this winters rally and a possible test of weekly resistance crossing at later this week Todays rally was supported by revised fourthquarter GDP estimates Additional support was due to expectations for further improvement in the economy although some of the expected recovery has already been priced into the Dollar Stochastics and the RSI are overbought hinting at the very least that we could see a brief pause near current prices The March Swiss Franc posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday signaling a likely end to this weeks short covering bounce The stage is set for additional weakness and a likely test of Decembers low crossing at later this winter The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness nearterm is likely The March Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a higher close on Wednesday however it failed to close above the previous reaction high crossing at Closes above this resistance level are needed to confirm this weeks trendline breakout and that a bottom has been posted Stochastics are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into midFebruary The March Japanese Yen extended this weeks short covering rebound on Wednesday and spiked above broken weekly support crossing at Closes above this broken support level and last falls downtrend line crossing near are needed to confirm a bottom has been posted Momentum indicators

leaving Tuesdays key reversal up unconfirmed Momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a low might be in or is near following this weeks test of the retracement level crossing at Closes above broken fib support crossing at are needed before a low can be confirmed March copper drifted lower on Wednesday and appears poised to test the bottom of last weeks trading range crossing at later this week Closes below last weeks low crossing at would open the door for a largerdegree decline during February Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into early February GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn closed fractionally lower on Wednesday as session lows came with in a penny of weekly support crossing that crosses at Light pressure came from spillover weakness from wheat concerns over sluggish export demand and a rebound in the US Dollar today Traders will closely watching Thursdays export sales report for signs that foreign demand might be picking up Bulls continue to suggest that this years export sales will be backend loaded In the meantime there is little incentive for foreign customers or domestic end users to shift their buying pattern from hand to mouth as prices continue to erode from last Julys high Seasonally corn prices tend to decline into February when a midwinter low is due to be posted The current decline suggests that the February low might be posted early in the month if weekly support crossing at halts the decline Shortterm momentum indicators are bearish but have entered their respective oversold zones hinting that a low might be near March wheat gapped down and closed sharply lower on Wednesday as much needed precip has fallen across the southern Plains The bearish weather triggered another round of fund selling that pressured the market to new lows for month which fell just short of testing the lateDecember low crossing at If this support level fails to halt this months decline a test of the December low crossing at is likely by earlyFebruary Recent strength in the US Dollar has made US wheat less competitive on the world market especially since Argentina is resuming wheat exports Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is likely into earlyFebruary SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close on Wednesday Light support was due to short covering triggered by ideas that soybean prices have become oversold and too cheap However upside potential appears limited due to improving weather conditions across South America and a narrowing window of opportunity to export on the world market without competing with South American exports Technically March soybeans continue to consolidate above the retracement level of Januarys rally which crosses at Closes below this support level would more than likely open the door for a test of this months low crossing at by earlyFebruary Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are likely into earlyFebruary before a midwinter low is due to be posted March soybean meal closed lower on Wednesday however a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of todays loss March continues to hover above gap support crossing at and below this the retracement level of Januarys rally crossing at Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are still possible into earlyFebruary While Thursdays export sales report is expected to show strong sales this is old news to a market which has been focused on South Americas potentially record crop for most of the winter Now that South American weather is improving there is little incentive for new buying to enter the market Therefore I am looking for additional weakness into midFebruary and a possible test of Januarys low of before a bottom is finally posted LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock April hogs posted a key reversal up and closed above weekly resistance crossing at on Wednesday Todays rally was triggered by ideas that packers could encounter a shortterm supply squeeze which could be exaggerated by the winter snowstorm that is moving across portions of the Midwest today and could last into Thursday bringing with it up to inches of snow in places However todays rally was limited due to forecasts calling for steady to cent lower cash bids on Thursday With packer margins shrinking due to falling product prices it is unlikely that they will be very aggressive with their cash bids However traders might decide to ignore the shortterm bearish cash fundamentals and opt to trade the shortterm friendly technicals near term Closes above the contract high crossing at would renew Aprils rally off last falls low and could lead to a test of weekly resistance crossing at later this winter Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are still possible into earlyFebruary April cattle closed slightly higher on Wednesday as a winter storm across the Plains and portions of the Midwest sparked additional short covering However todays rally was stopped in its tracks as it neared the retracement level of last years decline which crosses at After rallying for the past three days I would not be surprised to see a round of profit taking on Thursday as April might try to consolidate recent gains below this resistance level If this resistance level is cleared we could see April test the lower boundary of last summers trading range crossing at later this winter Momentum indicators are bullish but diverging which is a warning to bulls that a shortterm top might be near FOOD FIBER exchangescfood March coffee closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering following Tuesdays spike to a new contract low However short covering faded ahead of the close which allowed prices to drift towards the bottom of todays trading range March is at a crossroads as it is challenging the lower boundary of this winters trading range The latest report from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries highlighted the markets negative fundamental outlook as it forecasted a million kilogram bag surplus in export supplies for the marketing year Closes below trading range support crossing at would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a test of psychological support crossing at cents later this winter March cocoa posted its highest close in two and a half weeks on Wednesday due to renewed trade and speculator buying Light support came from reports of a police strike in the Ivory Coast limited hedge pressure and technical buying as buy stops were triggered above However the choppy rebound off the earlyJanuary low is an indication that the market continues to mark time as a distribution top continues to form Closes above or below are needed to confirm a breakout of this winters trading range and point the direction of the next trending move March sugar extended this months decline and closed below last Novembers reaction low crossing at on Wednesday Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for additional weakness and a possible test of last Octobers low crossing at during February Momentum indicators have entered their respective oversold zones but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm March cotton broke out below minor support marked by last weeks low at on Wednesday thereby renewing its decline off Januarys double top The stage is set for a likely test of the lower boundary of this winters trading range which crosses at Light pressure came from increased producer selling Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional

guard The Dow was up over points during the session and traded above trading range support crossing at and the FebruaryMarch downtrend line crossing near While a round of profit taking is possible ahead of the weekend todays strong performance as set the stage for additional gains this spring INTEREST RATES June bonds posted a key reversal up on Wednesday following todays surprise cut in interest rates Traders quickly began to speculate on the size of the next rate cut which traders seem to think will be another basis points at the May FOMC meeting Additional strength on Thursday

Tuesdays bearish API inventory data for crude oil The latest API data showed that crude oil inventories have risen to million barrels the highest level since August Todays sell off led to a breakout below Aprils uptrend line thereby increasing the odds that June crude oil might have posted a shortterm top A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of todays losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday Stochastics and RSI are overbought but remain bullish June heating oil gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday due to spillover weakness from crude oil and the

rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to attract following through buying in the afternoon session Additional weakness on Thursday would confirm todays bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the chances that a double top has likely been posted The June Swiss Franc and Dmark closed higher on Wednesday due to latesession short covering rallies Early weakness pushed the Swiss Franc toward last falls lows however selling dried up near minor support crossing at Additional strength on Thursday would confirm todays spindle bottoms and would set the stage for additional short covering into earlyMay The June Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday but near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close The late session bounce could spillover into Thursdays session however momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish warning traders that last weeks high might have marked a double top Look for sideways to lower trading into the end of April The June

signaling that additional gains nearterm are still possible if June can clear resistance crossing at Closes below Aprils uptrend line crossing near would signal an end to this months corrective bounce July silver extended Tuesdays loss but like June gold managed to close near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close Nevertheless this weeks setback suggests that July silver

latest weather forecast are calling for additional precip across the Midwest which could delay fieldwork However the latest planting progress report shows that corn planting thus far has progressed at an average pace This weeks setback has turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that Mondays high might have marked a double top Traders will be looking at Thursdays export sales report for nearterm direction However bulls are not holding out much hope for a bullish sales report on Thursday It appears that May corn will remain range bound between and for the time being until the market can get a better handle on planting progress and early growing conditions May wheat posted an upside reversal on Wednesday as spring wheat planting delays offered mild support to the market Additional support came from this years winter wheat crop ratings which remain well below last years levels Gains were limited as export demand remains quiet Technically momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into earlyMay are possible SOYBEAN COMPLEX May soybeans posted a key reversal up on Wednesday due to light fund buying and a tight cash market

Guaranteed E X T R E M E M A R K E T C O M M E N T A R Y The STOCK INDEXES exchangescindexes Stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday amidst heavy institutional selling by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Trading volume was thin which may have exaggerated some of todays losses Nevertheless both indexes posted new lows for the month thereby leaving the doors open for additional weakness into midFebruary The NASDAQ closed down points at and below the retracement level of the SeptemberJanuary rally If the decline continues Novembers reaction low crossing at marks the next level of support The March SP index also closed lower on Tuesday and below the retracement level of the SeptemberJanuary rally crossing at The door is open for a possible test of the lateOctober low crossing at later this month March closed down points at The Dow posted a quiet inside day with a lower close on Wednesday Losses were limited as Cisco Systems rekindled investor confidence in US companies with word that second quarter results will exceed current estimates However investors remain very nervous about current stock valuations amidst suspicions over corporate accounting irregularities Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is likely on Thursday that could lead to a test of last weeks low crossing at If this support level is broken it would open the door for a possible test of longterm fib support crossing at later this month INTEREST RATES exchangescinterest March Tbonds posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday amidst a relatively quiet session on Wall Street Additional pressure came from lower than expected participation of an auction of year notes March continues to consolidate below Januarys high crossing at If this resistance level is cleared Januarys high crossing at is a potential target later this month Stochastics and a number of other shortterm momentum indicators are bullish but diverging which is often a precursor to a top and trend change The CRB INDEX exchangescindexes The CRB index posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it was pressured by weakness in energies grains hogs bellies and some precious metals Wednesdays rally was halted dead in its tracks following a spike of Januarys downtrend line crossing near The CRBs failure to close above this resistance level and the previous reaction high crossing at is shortterm bearish and leaves the door open for additional weakness for the balance of the week At the same time stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish hinting that last weeks low might have marked a midwinter low ENERGY MARKETS exchangescenergy The energy markets closed lower on Tuesday following this weeks bearish inventory reports and sluggish demand Additional pressure came from a report out of Kuwait that it will resume oil exports from its northern fields just one week after an explosion shut down one third if its output March crude oil closed lower for the third day in a row thereby increasing the odds that last Fridays high marked the upper boundary of a latewinter trading range Additional weakness later this week would turn a number of shortterm momentum indicators neutral to bearish thereby signaling that sideways to lower prices might be possible into midFebruary It remains unlikely that March will breakout above the upper boundary of this winters trading range crossing at in the near future March heating oil closed lower on Wednesday as it extended this weeks sell off from last Fridays high This weeks bearish inventory report along with bearish extended weather forecast for the highdemand regions of the US continues to weigh on prices March heating oil has fallen back into Januarys trading range and in doing so has turned a number of shortterm momentum indicators neutral to bearish I would not be surprised to see March heating oil breakout below this winters trading range as it posts a new contract low later this month March unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Wednesday retracing just over of last weeks rebound since Monday Rising inventories and weak demand continue to offset the approach of seasonal trend changes in the market Stochastics and the RSI turned bearish with todays weakness signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the first half of February March Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher due to short covering ahead of this afternoons AGA inventory report on Wednesday This afternoons report showed a draw of billion cubic feet of natural gas taken from storage the low end of expectations This could limit if not pressure prices on Thursday as the market still has over trillion cubic feet of natural gas hanging over the market CURRENCIES exchangesccurrencies The March Dollar posted a potential downside reversal on Wednesday after early strength tied to short covering faded into the close However the near midrange close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday March needs to close below Mondays low crossing at to confirm a breakout below Januarys uptrend line Until then I caution anyone against becoming too bearish despite the overbought condition of the market The March Swiss Franc remained within Tuesdays trading range but closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering Todays close above last weeks high crossing at increases the odds that a double bottom with Decembers low was posted last week However closes above this winters downtrend line crossing near are needed before this can be confirmed This weeks rebound has turned the daily ADX bullish signaling that additional short covering is possible Todays midrange close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday I would caution anyone from becoming too bullish this market until this winters downtrend line has been broken The March Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Wednesday which led to a test of Januarys uptrend line crossing near and coincides with previous support Closes below would signal an end to this winters short covering bounce while opening the door for sideways to lower prices into midFebruary This weeks setback has turned stochastics and the RSI bearish thereby increasing the odds for sideways to lower prices nearterm The March Japanese Yen closed slightly higher on Wednesday as it consolidated some of Tuesdays loss The March yen is at a crossroads and will need to close above last falls downtrend line crossing near or below last weeks low crossing at to clear up nearterm direction in the market If this winters decline resumes weekly support crossing at is Marchs next target PRECIOUS METALS exchangescmetals April gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday amidst profit taking Early strength was due to spillover buying interest due to a breakdown in investor confidence over the valuation of equity prices However a relatively quiet trading day on Wall Street triggered a round profit taking following Aprils break out into new contract highs on Tuesday Aprils could spend the balance of this week consolidating above broken resistance crossing at If the rally resumes later this month weekly resistance crossing at is Aprils next target Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought warning bulls that a rebound in the equity markets could trigger a round of longliquidation as skittish investors rotate capital out of gold and back into stocks March silver posted a downside reversal on Wednesday Overnight strength fell just short of testing the retracement level of Januarys decline crossing at However a lack of panic selling in the equity markets early in the day session triggered a round of profit taking that extended into the close Wednesdays lowrange close leaves the door open for a steady to weaker opening for Thursday A lower close on Thursday would signal that the initial rebound off last weeks low has likely come to an end March copper closed lower on Wednesday as profit taking continues following last weeks dramatic run up Marchs inability to sustain a breakout above Novembers high crossing at along with a number of shortterm momentum indicators turning neutral to bearish from overbought levels hints that a broad double top might be in place Wednesdays midrange close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of this weeks losses GRAINS exchangescgrains March corn posted a new contract low on Wednesday following reports that Malaysia bought at least one cargo of Chinese corn for April shipment The renewed Chinese exports combined with sluggish US exports triggered another round of fund selling amidst a lack of buying interest A short covering bounce ahead of the close allowed March corn to close at longterm support crossing at If the decline continues psychological support crossing at is Marchs next target later this month Prereport sales exports for Thursday range from K to K metric tons which is still well below the pace needed to reach this years export projection Fears that the USDA will be forced to lower its export projection possibly on Friday also weighted on prices today Unless the US Dollar falls making US corn more competitive with other feed grains on the world market and or export demand sees a significant increase in the near future corn prices will continue to decline until increased demand surfaces March wheat posted an inside day with a lower close on Wednesday due to spill over weakness from corn and soybeans Its the same old story the bears continues to beat the strong US Dollar has made US wheat less competitive on the world market resulting in sluggish export demand Todays lowrange close leaves the door open for additional weakness on Thursday if export sales prove disappointing Decembers low crossing at marks the next level of support Closes below this low could lead to an eventual test of the contract low crossing at later this winter Prereport sales estimates range from K to K metric tons March wheat will need to close above Januarys downtrend line crossing near to temper the nearterm bearish outlook in the market SOYBEAN COMPLEX exchangescgrains March soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday erasing most of this weeks short covering gains Todays sell off was triggered by a lack of fresh market friendly news the start of harvest in Brazil and Chinas unwillingness to postpone its March th deadline for implementation of GMO policies regarding soybean imports While a short covering bounce late in the day tempered some of todays losses the door remains open for a likely test of last weeks low in the near future Traders are looking for tomorrows export sales report to come in between K to K metric tons While there is some talk that the USDA might raise its export projection for this year in Fridays report bearish traders are quick to say that any increase has already been factored into prices Until March soybeans can close above the reaction high crossing at the February low has not been confirmed March soybean meal posted a key reversal down on Wednesday as it filled the gap crossing at in early trading A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of todays gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday Prereport export sales estimates range from K to K metric tons Todays near midrange close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Thursday however trading is likely to be subdued ahead of Fridays supplydemand report Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible during the first half of February LIVESTOCK exchangesclivestock April hogs closed lower on Wednesday pressured by steady to lower cash bids and soft packer demand Light markets tempered todays sell off as April consolidated above broken resistance crossing at Nearby cash fundamentals continue to look sloppy with a weak tone in pork cutout values and shrinking packer margins Favorable weather conditions are also a potential bearish factor If the rally continues weekly resistance crossing at is a potential target later this week At the same time both daily and weekly stochastics are overbought hinting that a major top appears to be near However closes below initial trendline support crossing near are needed before this is confirmed April cattle closed higher on Wednesday and above the retracement level of last years decline crossing at If the rally continues the bottom of last summers trading range crossing at is a target later this month Todays rally was triggered by higher boxed beef values Cash bids have not be established however bullish traders are hoping to see bids later this week Wednesdays highrange close leaves the door open for additional gains on Thursday FOOD FIBER exchangescfood March coffee closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to light short covering following a gap lower opening which was triggered by origin and fund selling However light trade buying after the opened triggered a short covering bounce that lasted into the close March is at a crossroad and needs to close above or below to clear up nearterm direction in the market Momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a short covering bounce might be needed soon March cocoa posted an inside day with a higher close due to short covering that left Tuesdays downside reversal unconfirmed Closes above Januarys high at would negate the possibility that a double top is forming while opening the door for a possible test of weekly resistance crossing at later this winter Stochastics are still bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible nearterm March will need to close below last weeks low crossing at to temper the bullish outlook in the market May sugar closed higher on Wednesday but below midrange Early strength fell short of testing broken support marked by last Octobers low crossing at Until May can post multiple closes above this broken support level thereby tempering the bearish outlook in the market the door remains open for additional weakness later this month and a possible test of weekly support crossing at Momentum indicators are oversold but remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible nearterm March cotton posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on Wednesday as the market waits for nearterm direction following the release of Thursdays export sales report A friendly report on Thursday could renew Marchs rally off last weeks low that could lead to a test of Januarys high crossing at later this month Barring a major surprised in tomorrows report upside potential appears limited ahead of Fridays supplydemand report Cotton will likely remain range bound until the market
