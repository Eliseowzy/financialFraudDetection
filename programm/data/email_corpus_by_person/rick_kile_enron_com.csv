drip is at pipeline pressure and there are safety issues with sample collecting at the site I could probably attend if scheduled in advance if you want also an Ashland team member should probably be there Thanks From Charlie nronXgate on PM To Lynn nronXgate cc Dan nronXgate Stephen nronXGate Rick KileET NRON Ronnie BrickmanET NRON Kenneth nronXgate Subject FW Mt Jesus Condensate Oneok has every right to sample the location themselves and should I feel compelled to allow them some time to do so but also feel put upon given they have had over a year to do so but instead have chosen to stonewall us If you could keep the heat on in a firm but empathetic way that would be good Neubauer wants NNGOneok issues to be discovered defined and addressed or if necessary arbitrated quickly rather than allowing them to languish On another note if Delaine has not been the problem who has been I would have less sympathy for whoever has been dragging their feet probably wishing this would just go away than I do for Delaine who seems to be just trying to get to the bottom of it I sense she is hitting the same stonewall and Ill call you back run aroundwe have Charlie Original Message

Harry Subject RE Mt Jesus Condensate Charlie I agree we should get payment either way Gas Logistics is meeting with Oneok on Wednesday on some other matters Do you want Steve Herber or I to mention this again to Delaine or wait to see what their review says Thanks Lynn Original Message From Graham Charlie Sent Monday August AM To Blair Lynn Cc Brickman Ronnie Kile Rick Howard Randy Fancler Dan Moseley Debbie Rice Randy Stephens LD Cessac Kenneth Herber Stephen Subject FW Mt Jesus Condensate Lynn Thanks for your help getting this pushed along Shouldnt we take the approach that payment to Northern is expected immediately once Oneok verifies the liquid is condensate Whether they ever reach agreement with their hauler or not is not germane to paying us We have been pressing Oneok about Mt Jesus since April of and provided them with a sample analysis taken by us September You can see by the trail of emails below they seem to brush us off about once a month Thanks Charlie Original Message From Kurth Delaine mailto neokcom Sent Monday August AM To Graham Charlie Cc Subject RE Mt Jesus Condensate Charlie I talked with Mike Belcher and Jon Hanna about this on Friday for an update We have hired a consultant to go out there this week CP Resources They will evaluate the situation at Mt Jesus and at Sublette If determined that the liquids do have condensate in them we will pursue retroactive settlement with the current hauler Hopefully we will bring this to a close very soon Thanks for patience Delaine Original Message From mailto Sent Wednesday July AM To neokcom Cc Subject RE Mt Jesus Condensate Hi Delaine It has been a while so thought I would check on your review of our request for payment for Mt Jesus mmbtu Do you need anything more from NNG Charlie Original Message From Kurth Delaine neokcomENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESKurthCDelaineCdkurthOneokEcomEE NRONcom Sent Tuesday June PM To Graham Charlie Subject RE Mt Jesus Condensate Charlie I will reivew the information and get back to you as soon as possible Thanks Delaine Original Message From Graham Charlie mailtoCharlie NRONcom Sent Tuesday June PM To Delaine Kurth Email Subject Mt Jesus Condensate Delaine The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN now Oneok entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines equipment or facilities upstream of Oneoks Bushton Plant That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for pickingup hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtus attributable to the condensate removed Effective April Oneok began short paying its invoices The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April as This short payment reflects Oneoks refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip lease Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneoks contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northerns system at this point is water In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary Oneok accepts its contractors contention apparently pays a disposal fee and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtus lost This location produced condensate prior to the March agreement and no change to Northerns pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April In addition the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip Northern must insist that compensation for these BTUs removed from Northerns System be made by Oneok Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated Thanks Charlie Northern Natural Gas Company Shortpay Analysis Mt Jesus Drip BBLS GAL Date Rate BBLS Gallons Mmbtu Amount
