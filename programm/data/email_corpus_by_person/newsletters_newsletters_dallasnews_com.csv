covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the Holiday Bowl UTs quarterback situation probable NFL draft picks Mack Brown and more Inside UT Football appears o n Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Buy all your UT team gear at our EFanshopcom Chip Shot One of the most intriguing matchups to watch in this years Culligan Hol iday Bowl at San Diego will take place on the sidelines with Texas coach Mack Brown going up against Oregons Mike Bellotti You may not know much about Bellotti but know this about his tenure at Oregon in six years he has a record and those wins are more th an any other Pac school during that time period And over the last four seasons Oregon is with four consecutive bowl game appearances The Ducks two losses this season were by a combined total of points vs Wisconsin and at Oregon State Brown certainly is impressed by Bellottis success at Oregon Mike Bellotti is a personal friend Brown said in a news release from UTs sports information office He took over for Rich Brooks at Oregon a number of years ago when they were representing the Pac in the Rose Bowl for th e first time in a long time He has done a great job building on that success each of his years as head coach It will be fun to be around him and his te am throughout the week Added Holiday Bowl president Jim Philion Coach Bellotti has built the Ducks into one of the premiere football programs in the country The game this Dec against Texas will increase an already exciting rivalry betwee n the Pac and the Big Longhorn fans can purchase tickets to the Culligan Holiday Bowl by contacting the UT ticket office BEVO or by logging on to the athletics department Web site wwwTexasSportscom Longhorn Q A Q Longhorn officials will probably not say which bowl they would prefer to play in but were any of their options less desirable becau se of dates travel ticket sales or impressing recruits Todd Davis BROWN The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl I know that sounds like Well of course thats what they would say But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the Kansas game by saying if UT won out they would go to the Holiday Bowl a fun sunny destination against a top team Aside from the beach balls an d surfing the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game For instance Chris Simms was paid by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to the Cotton Bowl last year So hell really clean up this year Not that he needs it But you get the picture Its a way for some of the players to ma ke a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an d pocket the rest The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on their own The team will not charter a flight All players have to be checked into the team hotel in San Diego by pm on Dec Mack Brown wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would w in the Big South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top team And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team Last year Texas and its fans couldnt seem to get fired up for an unranked Arkansas team in the Cotton Bowl one year after having played in the same game So believe it when UT says the Holiday Bowl is where it wanted t o be IMAGE Casey Hampton Q How high do you think Casey Hampton will go in the NFL draft I woul d think hes a cinch first rounder Could he go in the top five BROWN Hampton could go in the first or second round The second round might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive linemen coming out this year But Hampton has been really watching his weig ht and trying to improve his speed He promised me that scouts at the NFL combine will be surprised when they see him work out Hampton is a great story The guy just works his tail off and knows that his height slightly more than will probably play against him So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNewsco m ran before the Texas Agame The film dont lie If you can show me whe re my height has hurt me its on you I would be surprised if Hampton fell to t he third round Q Lets see now Rose Bowl Cotton Bowl Sugar Bowl Orange B owl Fiesta Bowl Galleryfurniturecom Bowl Which one does NOT give you cold chills just to think about RR BROWN At least the galleryfurniturecom Bowl is not called the Poulan Weedeater Bowl a name that still haunts the nowSanford Independence Bowl where Texas Awill meet up with former coach Jackie Sherrill this year We have to hope the furniture bowl which will be played in the Houston Astrodome fairs better than the old Bluebonnet Bowl which went bankrupt a nd failed to pay Texas and Pittsburgh their purses for the game won by U T That was the last bowl game ever played in Houston Q Texas quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thi ng manufactured by the illfated rotation scheme Now however the quarterba ck controversy is real Texas now has two genuine starting quarterbacks Chri s Simms is no longer the next boy wonder He has arrived Does ANYONE in the nation have a better quarterback tandem than Texas How in the world is Ma ck Brown going to deal with this If they keep the simplified offensive schem e next year do you think the QB rotation could resurface and actually work Rowell Rogers Denton Texas BROWN I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penn y of his salary because of the quarterback situation And hell earn every penny again next year Unless unforseen circumstances such as injuries dictate otherwise I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next year And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms next year He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite just as Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton If Simms starts t he bowl game and Texas plays well and wins Simms will have done nothing to lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com e in and relieve him then we are back to square one with both guys battling it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter Texas coaches have said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this season because of his experience So well see if their stance has changed Q The yard pumpandgo TD play from Chris Simms to BJ Johnson is both a validation of Simms abilities AND an indictment of the quarterback rotation Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played every offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the defensive player responsible To my mind that is a strong argument agains t any kind of QB rotation scheme But on the other hand how can one NOT wa nt to play both of these immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible Can we get a rule change to allow two footballs on the field at once ha ha BROWN The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota tion next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris h whenever he is on the field But his comments all season have directly and indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence didnt come around until he was taking all the snaps So I dont know if th e coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his confidence IMAGE Mack Brown Q What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach I noticed earl ier in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Browns ability to fire up the tea m assuming that Texas has more talented players I think that he has proven that he can win big games but he has also had some surprising slipups Bro wn is unquestionably a great recruiter but do you question his leadership ability on gameday Andrew Wootton BROWN Up until the Texas Tech game Mack Brown was saying things like We could lose any game we play I just dont know which team is going to show up We could go or Those kinds of comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the Longhorns Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any coach Ive been around So when he was saying things like that it made you wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity Clearly this ye ar was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense The defens e was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge But the offense really struggled to find an identity Part of that was the quarterback rotation Part of it was having young receivers and part of it was having a bunch of guys with lowkey personalities ie Hodges Mitchell Leonard Davis Antwa n KirkHughes Derrick Dockery Mike Williams etc Mack Brown even said it was the quietest bunch of offensive players hed been around Once Mack Bro wn and Co decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t he starter Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as anything else I think Mack Brown is a great coach Let me say that again He is a grea t coach I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi p on the field The more he rotated the QBs the less chance the offense had to develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit h learning their responsibilities in fourwide as well as trying to adjust to having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle The offensive linemen earl y on also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi m Im sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly than it did Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he played Simms more in the Stanford game an outing in which Applewhite real ly struggled until the fourth quarter Against Oklahoma the Sooners executed flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldnt get up from It was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo n in Austin according to many But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati ng out of his hand any time he wants All he has to do is tune out the negativ e comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say We are doing the best we can We learn We make mistakes Were going to keep trying harder Those are comments no negative fan can argue with Instead Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint everything about this season Each press conference was filled with a comme nt about how the media and fans had beat up this years team It was contentious Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times Paterno hates the media rarely gives out interviews etc So if Mack Brown is following in Paternos footsteps on that issue it would be a shame Paterno doesnt have onequillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow n Brown got tough questions during his radio callin show this season Som e weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others But a guy like Brown is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off of his back use that selfdeprecating laugh of his and then take his frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi s team into a juggernaut Mack Brown should know his teams personality going into next year because so many players will be back And hell have this ye ar as a blueprint of how not to do things in many instances And hes where h e wants to be at a major college football power and always being in the position of favorite At North Carolina as well as he recruited and coache d Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood At Texa s he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big Now Oklahoma has come charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without excuses If you notice Stoops didnt gripe about having to play the Big title game and possibly ruin his teams national title chances He didnt gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in Kansas City He has a tough attitude and his team has adopted his attitude Brown has a tough attitude too And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and all of next season will be the truest test of Browns coaching and dealing with expectations Brown said fairly and accurately that Texas couldnt b e expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadnt finished a season in the top since How do you jump to No witho ut having first been in the top Brown said before the season Does this kind of talk trickle into the ears of players I dont know Most of the Longhorns before the season Applewhite and Hampton included felt like Tex as could win the national title Thats one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam e back to Texas this season When UT lost to Stanford Brown emerged from an emotionally blasted locker room and said I didnt think this was a nation al title team He went on to say the team was too young Are these excuses fo r his team If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl the Longhorns will hav e their top finish and will once again be ranked in the top heading int o next season On defense the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca sey Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on But Marcus Tubbs Adam Doiron a nd Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better and there is a wealth of talent in the seven guys behind them On offense the big question mark is at running back where Hodges Mitchell is moving on Hes a guy some Texas fan s still think is worthless But let me tell you he isnt Hes got guts and gave everything he had It may take some time to see another back who can catch and run the way he does UT will have several backs to pick from including freshmantobe Cedric Benson The rest of the team is proven and will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end I dont see any excuses for this team next year National championship t alk will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda Heres hoping that Mac k Brown doesnt let the nitpickers bog him down And I include myself in that group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact s positive or negative Heres to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl e negative angles in a newspaper story Heres to hoping that hell take on critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily basis Places like Texas Alabama and Ohio State have fans who are seemingl y never satisfied Until Brown wins a national championship UT fans will secondguess and doubt and wonder why something else wasnt tried That cou ld continue even if he wins a national title But thats sports Its worse no w because there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the Internet and allday talk radio Mack Brown lives under a microscope Fans think the y are as smart as coaches because they manage a fantasy football team Brown just has to shrug off the naysayers and focus on the reasons he loves coaching Q Among UTs current commitments who do you see as the freshmen most likely to see significant playing time next year BROWN The more I see and hear about Midland Lee running back Cedric Benson the more I think he has the best chance to have an impact next year He appears to have the kind of vision that makes running backs special Q Only two teams had a strength of schedule rating above in the BC S rankings and all the top five teams had a sub rating Given that UT has a decent chance in the national championship race next year what if anythi ng can UT do to help raise its strength of schedule rating Seems like the Longhorns could go undefeated and still be on the outside looking in Andrew Bowen BROWN Well gauging by how some of the BCS polls had Florida State hi gher than Oklahoma I think its fair to say that strength of schedule is a concern for Texas next year I think Texas has to win all its games next season to make sure that it is not in the position of Miami which beat Florida State but is not in the national championship picture If Texas goe s next season the Longhorns could very well not be in control of their own destiny With their schedule as crazy and inflatedexpectationriddled as this sounds the Longhorns would probably need to win all the games to ensure getting a shot at the national championship next season IMAGE Leonard Davis Q Who will be drafted off this team Any first rounders Will the draft distract the seniors from the bowl game Will any juniors declare early Is the NFL looking at any underclassmen on the team Lance Grand Prairie BROWN The obvious draft picks are OT Leonard Davis DT Casey Hampton and DT Shaun Rogers SS Greg Brown may also get a look from an NFL team after t he year he has had I think Davis is a firstround pick for sure Hampton and Rogers shouldnt fall past the second round although they could simply because there are a number of top defensive lineman in next years NFL draft NFL scouts are intrigued by junior Quenti n Jammer because of his size and physical play at cornerback NFL scouts like junior DeAndre Lewis speed and size at linebacker But UT officials seem confident that no underclassmen will jump from this years team Q Please discuss the coaching staffs approach to bowl games Did we approach the Mississippi State Cotton Bowl with a different philosophy or attitude than the Arkansas Cotton Bowl What is our attitude about Oregon a nd the Holiday Bowl Keith Heugatter BROWN The Cotton Bowl after the season was the final chapter to a storybook season That team was riding the euphoria of Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy and felt like it was on top of the world The team that face d Arkansas in last Januarys Cotton Bowl had lost two straight and then found itself back in Dallas feeling a little unsure about itself against an Arkansas team looking for its first bowl victory since This season Texas is riding a sixgame winning streak finally got the breakout game it was looking for from Chris Simms and really wants to win its bowl game to finish in the top for the first time in years I would be surprised very surprised if Texas comes out flat and doesnt make a good showing in the Holiday Bowl Even though they dont know much about Oregon the Longhorns know the Ducks are ranked higher than they are Thats all they need to know If the players can avoid the trouble they ran into before las t years Cotton Bowl suspensions to two team leaders Aaron Humphrey and Kwa me Cavil as well as JJ Kelly and Jamal Joyner I think Texas will be stron g and focused Q Is Leonard Davis up for any major awards this season Clark Routier BROWN Longhorn OT Leonard Davis is one of three finalists for the Out land Trophy The award will be presented live on Thursday night pm Central on the ESPN College Football Awards Show at Disney World Davis ha s been tabbed a firstteam AllAmerican by The Football Writers Association Walter Camp Football Foundation and Sporting News Q Can you give us an update on the mens basketball team Shirley Lively BROWN The mens team is starting to come together and could get a hug e boost in the next couple of weeks if senior Darren Kelly can regain his eligibility The semester ends Dec but coach Rick Barnes isnt sure wh en hell find out if Kelly has made his grades and regained his academic standing for next semester One thing is for sure Barnes believes the Longhorns will only get better with Kelly in the lineup He said Kelly dominates in practice with his dribble penetration and quickness He said Kelly would help players like junior transfer Maurice Evans Evans by the way has continued to look more comfortable in the Longhorns offense He w as named the Phillips Big Conference Rookie of the Week the league offi ce announced Tuesday The junior transfer earned the award by averaging points per game while hitting of field goals including of threepointers during Texas two victories over UTSan Antonio and Southwest Texas State last week The honor is chosen by a panel of media observers who cover Big mens basketball Evans had a seasonhigh points on of shooting of threes vs UTSan Antonio before posti ng points on of shooting of threes against Southwest Texas The lone Longhorn to reach doublefigure scoring in each of UTs first six contests he leads the team in scoring ppg and ranks third in rebounding rpg and blocks five Texas returns to action when it travels to Tampa Fla to face South Florida on Saturday Dec Tipoff is scheduled for pm Central at the Sun Dome The game will be televised nationally by ESPN Q Can you give us an update on the womens basketball team Dana Gooden BROWN The UT women are and off to their best start since the season They moved into the top No this week and then backed it up by traveling to Illinois and pounding the Fighting Illini The Illin i were ranked No last week UT extends its win streak to six games marki ng the first time since that the Horns have had a sixgame win streak The leaders of this years team are JoRuth Woods of Cedar Hill Tai Dillard of San Antonio freshman Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro sophomore Lindsey Rya n of Austin Westlake and Tracy Cook of Cedar Hill UT is also getting help at point guard from junior college transfer Kenya Larkin of Duncanville Freshman forward Annissa Hastings will also be one to watch UT plays Orego n at home on Saturday and then wont have another test until Tennessee comes to town on Dec If you received this newsletter from a

who covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the bowl picture UTs quarterback situation Chris Simms next years potential stars and more Inside UT Football appea rs on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot I received several responses to an email from a reader last week regard ing UTs uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them Here are some o f the responses One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their uniforms I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the classiest coolest uniforms in the country I admit to being biased but love the simple nonbusy look of the allwhite uniforms I also have no problem wi th the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested The white helmets with the simple yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as pronounced a s the star on the Dallas Cowboys helmet While I agree with him about the black shoes I think any changes to individualize or otherwise change their look would be a move in the wrong direction Rick Peurifoy I was interested in John Pharrs comments about the UT uniforms Having been at UT in the s I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go I certainly think the best uniforms were in the season perhaps influenc ed by a national championship These were burnt orange jerseys sans individual name on back and TEXAS on the front with the plain white pan ts and orange stockings The white uniform still had the orange stockings but the jersey was white You may remember that Fred Akers brought the candystriped pants ala OU and added the TEXAS to the jersey Personally I like the jersey but think the return of the orange stockings would add something to both uniforms but particularly the road white One amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the uniforms his response was that these are work clothes and not intended t o be fancy I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac k a long way I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the Longhorn in the early s but it didnt add much Keep up the good work I always enjoy your newsletter Tom Thornell Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms I think they are amo ng the sharpest anywhere If we change the helmets then we look like a high school team What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are orange and white Period So what if it doesnt have too much color I hope we stay exactly the same Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an d added orange pants They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field Russell Phillips Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us a look at the bowl picture Sandy Martin BROWN Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday a nd will face either Oregon State or Oregon It will be Oregon State if the Beavers dont get a BCS berth It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BC S berth If OU beats Kansas State look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton Bowl Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl Iowa State would go to the Insightcom Bowl Texas Awould go to the Independence Bowl in Shrevepor t and play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State and Texas Tech wou ld go to the galleryfurniturecom Bowl IMAGE Chris Simms Q Im very happy for Chris Simms but what should we expect from him no w It seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt although one could argue that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year Stil l since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank ed after five passes a redshirt seems like a reach If he doesnt redshirt what is the best guess for Texas QB in I know that you get asked this ever y week but with the new development following the Agame it seems that w e are starting fresh in this story Kyle Moore BROWN Simms bigtime performance against Aadds all kinds of new wrinkles to the landscape for My best guess is Simms will get the start for th e bowl game and well be back in the same situation we were heading into this season Major Applewhites knee injury this time to his right knee again gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms not only now but heading into t he spring and next fall Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldnt rule out a rotation again But one would have to think after the sluggish start the offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be reluctant to do that again Despite breaking nearly every passing record at Texas Applewhite didnt look as sharp as he has in the past during his las t outings before getting injured Simms would seem to have everything going h is way The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie r this season Now that theyve seen it you would have to think that they wa nt to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw o years not stick with a guy who only has one season left Im not saying thats fair But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would think But we wont know how the QB situation for will shake out until next fall most likely Q Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning UT cou ld have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full Do y ou think BJ Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on Did they just blossom during the Agame Otherwise why havent they see n the field more AB BROWN Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season bu t you could certainly argue that UT should use more threereceiver sets next year with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha ve back at those positions There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t he fullback position was pretty average this season So the coaches will take a strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB At and he has the size He is also quick with good hands If Matthews doesnt add significant oomph to the FB position it could be argued that UT should try to use more oneback sets and get its WR talent on the field But well see UT coaches did a nice job of adjusting this season to a twoback tworeceiver set aft er they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers with too many formations and too many quarterbacks Now that the receivers can probably handle more of the playbook look for UT to be as multiple and complex an offense as possible next season BJ Johnson finished the year as the team s secondleading receiver so he saw the field plenty Sloan Thomas was the o ne who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions and be ready to fill in at any of them So he was slowed by the learning process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and Brandon Healy Healy is a senior so hell be gone next year Flowers shoul d be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking Q Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are either redshirting or transferred Bart Fields BROWN Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer Kyle Shanahan the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan Simms said both will really help the team a lot next year Jeffery is and trying t o bulk up from pounds Shanahan is and trying to bulk up from pounds But both have shown great hands in practice The first two names th at jumped off of Mack Browns lips when asked about players to watch in bowl practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas With Texas losing four linebackers after next season DeAnd re Lewis Everick Rawls Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones Brown said some new faces will have to play a bunch in to be ready to become starters at linebacker in two years Q Im a little concerned about our running backs Next years crop loo ks mighty inexperienced We never seemed to be able to run up the middle consistently this year Who would you figure has the best shot at being an inside bruiser What role will our fullbacks play Russell Phillips BROWN Its the biggest question mark on an offense that should be absolutely loaded next season I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov er at tackle nicely Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar r has lost about pounds from to and looks good So with a line that should continue to improve the Longhorns just need a back who can run behind it Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility Coaches want Victor Ike Ken ny Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up Coaches have told those three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce consistently IMAGE Sloan Thomas Q With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has is there enough room at wideo ut for Artie Ellis next season Frank Seles BROWN Dont be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season At and more than pounds he is a bit undersized but could add the weight His speed would give Texas the surehanded deepthreat tight end they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife It may be a longshot but don t be surprised Q While watching the AMUT game I noticed that UT received the ball at the opening kickoff and the secondhalf kickoff And UT got the wind at its back in the th quarter How did this happen and if Awon the toss why would the Aggies choose to defer give UT the ball at both kickoffs and go into the wind in the nd and th quarters Ryan M Austin BROWN Texas Awon the toss at the beginning of the game and chose the wind at its back giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter The Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter and took the ball into the wind Q Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team co ach UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams This year the Longhorns would have been and possibly on their way to a BCS game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown against Stanford With money apparently not being a factor I really do not understand why Brown doesnt break down and hire some specialized help Don Stevenson Huntington Texas BROWN I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan which is to divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches IMAGE DeAndre Lewis making the tackle Q Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is f or a winning team Weve had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer a nd James Brown whose onfield performances may have been surpassed by their offfield contributions I think were losing a lot of leadership this year when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave Of the returning players who does it look like will step up as team leaders next year Keith Heugatter BROWN On defense Mack Brown said hell look for Cory Redding and De Andre Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers and Greg Brown On offense UT will look to its quarterback its young receiver s and linemen such as Antwan KirkHughes of Waxahachie for leadership Q What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season Steve Beauchamp BROWN The obvious ones are Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers Greg Brown H odges Mitchell and Leonard Davis But the one that may be missed the most is Kris Stockton He kicked several gamewinning field goals two years ago and has done nothing but continue to break records since He has been an afterthoug ht because he has been so automatic on field goals He has also done an excellent job of punting this season Matt McFadden a redshirt freshman will handle the kicking duties next year And at punter redshirt freshman Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed to the Longhorns for next year That will be a huge question mark for Texas to answer next season Q Who do you pick in the Kansas StateOU game Seems like OU is missin g its October magic Id have to take OU in a close one Heupel isnt grea t but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offens e in the pros Andrew Bowen BROWN I too think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue its Shock the World season Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman The vote s are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum Q Can you give us an update on the mens and womens basketball teams Lucius Thornton BROWN The mens team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victor ies over Navy California and Indiana any of which could help the Longhorns down the road at tournament time The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT but coach Rick Barnes was able to prove a point to his team about being intimidated As of Tuesday nights game with UTSan Antonio Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup point guard Royal Ivey small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thoma s Duncanvilles Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward Chri s Owens has been a shotblocking force and transfer Maurice Evans is the teams leading scorer and is starting to hit a better percentage from the floor The mens team doesnt have another test until Dec when the team plays at South Florida Other games worth watching or getting tickets for include home games against Illinois Dec and Utah Dec The women s team has also gotten off to a nice start with its only earlyseason loss coming against Purdue The womens team is relying on several newcomers including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings The team i s also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard So both teams are young with a lot of upside If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter

statistic that matters concerning the Aggies UT leads the overall series Longhorn Q A Q What is the latest on the Texas QB situation Ted Manges BROWN Chris Simms will start Friday He took nearly all the snaps for the first five practices during which UT worked on the Agame plan Major Applewhites right knee appears to be responding pretty well He practiced Tuesday for the first time since getting injured at Texas Tech Mack Brown said if Applewhite is healthy enough to back up Simms he would use Applewhite on a needtowinthegame basis Those situations would seem to include Simms getting hurt or Simms being completely ineffective Otherwise look for Simms to play most or all of Fridays game IMAGE Kenny Hayter Q Next year when Hodges Mitchell is gone will Texas play Kenny Hayter or freshman Cedric Benson Why Cotton Davis BROWN I think its too early to tell If Benson is as good as adverti sed I think hell have a good chance of playing early because Kenny Hayter Iva n Williams and Victor Ike did not overwhelm the coaches this season But Snee zy Beltran will be coming off of a redshirt season too And hell probably ha ve a say in how much playing time anyone gets Q Can you give us an update on injuries BROWN TE Brock Edwards leg DT Stevie Lee foot and WR Artie Ellis shin are out SS Lee Jackson hamstring and QB Major Applewhite knee a re questionable For AM LB Jason Glenn knee the Aggies leader in sacks i s out WR Robert Ferguson ankle and CB Sammy Davis ankle both did not practice Tuesday for the Aggies and were listed as questionable Q I sent you a question last week about the intensity and hate that the Horns didnt have for the OU game and was wondering if Coach Brown a thin ks he made a mistake by having the players take the OU game so lightly with comments like we dont hate OU and its just another game on t he schedule and b is that the attitude that will prevail going into the Agame and in future OU games Joe Rushing BROWN Mack Brown and his staff are not an inyourface group of coach es Players say that they are treated with respect Make no mistake they know their jobs are on the line every day in practice They know if they dont perform in practice they will be replaced But SS Greg Brown said that Mac k Brown has never given a hell hath no fury locker room talk before durin g or after a game Greg Brown said that Mack simply states whats on the line for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate themselves Mack has said that as well He said he asks players what works for them best whether it be the toughlove approach or the straightforward approach He has said constant yelling wears off So he doesnt play head games with his team According to coaches and players from his time as OU offensive coordinator back in Mack used to be a much more inyourfac e kind of coach yelling at players to get them going Coach Barry Switzer ha d to tone him down Brown said he has learned that you cant be negative with players that you have to treat them with respect I dont know that you wi ll hear him talk about hating other teams Q Looking at the haul of recruits Texas already has commitments from is there an area of need not being addressed It appears that this is quite a haul of offensive linemen so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the makin g If he signs what will Quan Cosby be asked to do Doesnt he have a twin brother and is that a factor on where he signs When all is said and done where do you think this class will rank come signing day in February and which of the potential signees not orally committed will most determine where that rank ends up Also with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt ye ar and from what I am reading an impressive one at that what do you see in t he future for Cedric Benson What about the returning RBs such as Ivan William s Kenny Hayter et al Is the abundance of talent at RB a good thing or too much of a good thing And one last thing Is anyone looking to transfer aft er the season Roy Cassas BROWN Quarterbacks and linemen on both sides of the ball control th e game so you can never have enough of those positions UT is filling its needs nicely with the commitments that it has The player that can probably make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison perhaps th e best defensive tackle in the country UTs class is shaping up as a top nationally again If Harris comes it will climb But as is the case with all of this recruiting hype its just that hype Who knows if Cedric Benson will play next year He has to come down here in the heat of August and prove to the coaches that hes better than Kenny Hayter Ivan Williams Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran I would say Bensons chances are good if som e of those guys dont toughen up and let loose But time will tell As far as guys looking to transfer there arent any rumblings yet Stay tuned IMAGE UTs road uniforms Q I can say this because I am a graduate of the University of Texas I think the Longhorn football team has the UGLIEST uniform in all of college football When the Horns play on the road they have too much white and not enough color They wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long sol id white socks are atrocious It looks like each player can dress anyway he desires there is no uniformity in the look Some players dont even wear socks at all It seems the coaches let each player express their own individuality and I think they play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team Coach McWilliams let this trend start and it has continued through the current regime with poor results The orange home jerseys are not the right color orange and they look cheap I wish Coach Brown would adopt a true burnt orange color I wis h he would change the helmets to the same burnt orange color with a white traditional Longhorn logo on each side and a white facemask Shirttails should be tucked in and each player should be dressed the same Few indicators of individuality should be allowed The Longhorns look ragtag an d slow on the field If they would improve their image their play might improve as well John Robert Pharr Waco Texas BROWN That seemed to be more of a comment than a question But everyo ne is entitled to their own opinion I dont know about the burnt orange helmets That might be a little too much of a good thing Q Do you think that the loss to OU will hurt our recruiting class I k now that we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their recrui ts at the Cotton Bowl since they were the home team T Franks Austin BROWN It appears that Oklahoma is making some serious inroads on UT recruiting territory at least for the or so recruits the Longhorns stil l hope to get orally committed Namely Tommie Harris the defensive tackle o ut of Killeen Ellison Texas needs to take care of business on Friday to keep the Sooners from stepping up their pitch for some of the noncommitted kids UT is hoping to sign Q The lack of respect Texas is getting leading up to the Agame is disturbing I understand that the Horns were crushed against OU and also ha d an earlyseason loss against Stanford on the road but even with the stats from those two losses the Horns have one of the nations top defensive units plus we are playing at home and are riding the confidence of five consecutive wins Derrick Jackson Coppell Texas BROWN Well Texas is a point favorite so I dont know where th e lack of respect comes from But I think people are lukewarm about UT becaus e the Longhorns havent had a chance to show how much theyve improved agains t a quality opponent until now The Longhorns need to go out and grind the Aggies into the ground to get the nations attention And I think they will Im predicting Texas A IMAGE Quentin Jammer Q What are the key matchups in Fridays game Lucas Harrington BROWN In think the best matchups will be MLB DeAndre Lewis against A Ms corps of running backs namely JaMar Toombs Also keep an eye on Quentin Jammer against AWR Robert Ferguson Lewis basically said this week that if you hit Toombs in the mouth hell fold So that immediately inspires some interest in that matchup Jammer also had a lot to say about Ferguson stating that if Fergusons ankle wasnt percent it might not even be a close matchu p If hes percent or percent that wont cut it Jammer said Jammer did say that he thought a healthy Ferguson was better than Kansas State WR Quincy Morgan Jammer and Ferguson are both big roughly and pounds Should be fun to watch Q Is Texas Aa legitimate passing team after all these years of try ing to air out the ball and not being able to Stephen Torrence BROWN I think so It seems hard to believe After Branndon Stewart an d all the hype about building a bigtime passing offense the past several years its finally hit College Station The Aggies run fourwide even fivewide They have trick plays and Robert Ferguson Bethel Johnson and Chris Taylor are bigtime receivers And yearold QB Mark Farris is the gritty leader and percent passer they have been looking for I think it will be a dece nt test for Texas owner of the nations No ranked pass efficiency defense Q Why does Texas keep throwing that out pattern and allowing Chris Sim ms to be intercepted for touchdowns Margie Phillips BROWN Ill let Mack Brown answer that one Its not the same pass or we would throw it out of the playbook Were not that dumb That was his comment Tuesday night on his radio show Q Do you think Chris Simms is ready for the pressure of the Texas A game Deginald Franks BROWN I think so Simms seemed to grow in confidence after the Kansas game Getting the chance to pull the Longhorns out of a hole after throwing a pick for a TD really seemed to give him a positive jolt Normall y he would have been pulled at that point for Major Applewhite at least he would have been pulled early in the season a la LouisianaLafayette So getting the chance to play an entire game seemed to help I believe Simms will be fine on Friday He must feel good about his deep ball to Roy Willia ms after the success they had at Kansas I would expect to see a lot more of that creating room for Hodges Mitchell to run against a depleted Afron t seven Q I heard that this is only the ninth time that Texas and Texas Aa re both ranked coming into this game That doesnt seem right Brock Marshal BROWN It doesnt seem right but it is Of the times these two te ams have met including this year both have been ranked only nine times Thos e years are and If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at

covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the Hex Rally next years schedule Chris Simms bowl prospects recruiting Texas Aand more Inside UT Football appears on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot Thirteen senior Longhorns will be playing their final home game when Tex as meets Texas Aon Friday Nov They will be honored in a pregame ceremony Among the seniors playing their final home game are six current starters Free safety Greg Brown of Baton Rouge La offensive tackle Leonard Da vis of Wortham defensive tackle Casey Hampton of Galveston Ball running back Hodges Mitchell of Skyline defensive tackle Shaun Rogers of LaPorte and placekicker Kris Stockton of Katy Five other seniors who have seen significant playing time are Wide receiver Brandon Healy of Carlsbad Calif punter Ryan Long of Richardson Pearce offensive tackle Cory Quye of San Antonio Marshall wide receiver Jamel Thompson of Skyline and safety Joe Walker of Galena Park North Shore Other seniors playing their final game are Linebacker Scott Emley of San Antonio Churchill and defensive back Marc us Walther of Hillcrest Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us the history behind the Hex Rally And also when is it this year Margot Linney BROWN According to the Texas sports information office the Hex Rally will be held Monday Nov at pm on the universitys main mall in front o f the UT Tower For years the TexasTexas A game featured bonfires at bo th schools But the environmentalists won out in Austin causing the end to th e bonfire for UT students In place of the traditional bonfire Texas turned instead to an old story to start a new tradition In Texas had not beaten Texas Aat Kyle Field since A group of students turned to a n Austin fortune teller named Mrs August Hipple who gave them the prescription for victory Burn red candles she said The burning of the candles she thought would show the great support for the team Texas won and the red candle legend was born The candle burning lay dormant until when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU game and the Longhorns upset No SMU It was back in the boxes fo r the candles after that until when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was unbeaten and seeking its firstever SWC title Texas blocked an extra point after the first score and won The red candles are the most potent whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked wrote Tim e magazine after the upset In Texas was driving for its first unbeaten season in modern history and the possibility of a national championship as it hosted Baylor For three of the previous four years UT had been in the same position on the verge of a perfect year only to be upset Out came the red candles one more time and UT won Bonfires ended in Austin in the late s and seeking a new tradition the hex rallies were started in IMAGE Chris Simms Q So far this season Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that we re returned for touchdowns if you count the return on the failed twopoint conversion attempt last week in Kansas Can you help explain what Chris is doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem Also has Chris set a school record in this statistic I enjoy the newsletter Jeff Cookston BROWN Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking onto his intended receiver too early in his drop back He will look away from hi s intended receiver but only for a split second He needs to look off the defense better an d he also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage He suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre He sees a receiver in double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and returned for a TD against Kansas He said he should have thrown it away He said hes learning He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas is at an alltime high So thats good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up getting the start against Texas AM Q I have heard that next years schedule is just about as weak as this years Can you either give it to us or let us know where on the Web to fi nd it Steve Davis BROWN The schedule is as follows Sept New Mexico State Sep t North Carolina Sept at Houston Sept Texas Tech Oct Oklahom a in Dallas Oct at Oklahoma State Oct Colorado Oct at Missouri Nov at Baylor Nov Kansas and Nov or at Texas AM Q Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle To his credit he maintained that two QBs were better than one At this stage and based on Chris Simms recent games it would seem to me that Brown was correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five games in a row Also Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simm s motivated What do you think Charley Davis Southlake Texas BROWN I think the rotation is now paying off But I still stand by my belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in t he year Mack Brown said the rotation didnt work as well as it could have because this years team lacked senior leadership At North Carolina Brown said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older Anyway theres no doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year A nd Simms is definitely still happy at Texas No chance of him transferring Q Can you update us on UTs injuries Ken BROWN As of right now Major Applewhites right knee sprain is keepin g him out of practice this week and he is questionable for the Agame SS Lee Jackson hamstring is probable TE Brock Edwards leg and WR Artie Ellis shin are questionable DT Stevie Lee foot is out and will seek a medica l redshirt for this season a move that would give him four years of eligibility remaining IMAGE Cedric Benson in white uniform Q Id like an update on recruiting our commitments our prospects and how you think we will finish Matt Dunnahoo BROWN Texas has oral commitments with roughly six or seven scholar ships remaining There are recruits left who have either been offered a scholarship or who are strongly considering Texas They are DT Tommie Harr is of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Calif TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson both of Galena Park North Shore OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville OL William Winston of Houston Madison S Dwayne Brandon o f Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Brossard of Blinn JC Johnson Jakes Moses Jackson and Brandon are strong Texas leans at this point Most of those players will visit Texas on the weekend of Dec the same weekend as the UT football banquet Texas oral commitments are from the following studentathletes OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter OL Abe Robinson Jersey Village OL Alfio Randall Blinn JC OL Mike Garcia Galena Park OL Will Allen Cypress Falls OL Roman Reeves Livingston OL Terrance Young Longview QB Matt Nordgren Dallas Bishop Lynch RB Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson DE Eric Hal l Clarksville Tenn LB Yamil LeBron Kille en Ellison LB Lance McFarland Jefferson DB Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes DB Aaron Ross Tyler DB Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship DB Braden Johnson Euless Trinity DB Brian Carter The Woodlands P Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC Q Which bowl do you see UT ending up in I know that the secondplace team in the Big goes to the Cotton Bowl What place would Texas be if we defeated AM I remember that when Abeat Kansas State a few years ago KState ended up in the Alamo Bowl and UT played in the Cotton Bowl Is the re a chance of a repeat of that if OU beats KState in the Big championship game Mike Thakur BROWN If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big title game there s a chance both teams will get into the BCS Nebraska would then be the likely choice for the Cotton Bowl and the TexasTexas Awinner would be the li kely choice for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl But there are rumblings that Nebraska isnt excited about the Cotton Bowl and would rather go to the Holiday Bowl That could send the UTAwinner to the Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix Ariz If Oklahoma beats Kansas State the Wildcats would have thre e losses including one to Texas AM That means the Wildcats would probably drop to the Insightcom Bowl And the winner of the UTAgame would go t o either the Holiday or the Cotton with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl T he Holiday opponent would be either Oregon or Oregon State The Alamo opponent would likely be Michigan or Ohio State Q Dont you think Texas has a huge advantage over my Fighting Texas Ag gies for the following reasons UTs playing at home Jason Glenn Robert Ferguson and Sammy Davis three of the Aggies best players are going to be out for the game and AMs coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma i n the biggest game of the year on a national stage It will be hard to recove r from that It looks as if Texas has everything going for it I believe if Awould have beaten Oklahoma there is not any way Texas beats Awhen the Big south crown is on the line Justin S Schwertner BROWN I dont see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahom a loss They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence fro m that game The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss or diminished ability of Glenn Ferguson and Davis Glenn the teams sack leader and a spirited leader at linebacker is out for sure with a knee injury that will require surgery If Ferguson one of the top receivers in the Big and Davis a top cornerback for the Aggies indeed cannot play those are big hurdles to overcome for AM Playing in Austin helps Texas But this game will probably come down to who runs the ball best Look for this to be a showdown between JaMar Toombs and Hodges Mitchell IMAGE Roy Williams Q I thought Roy Williams was good before the Kansas game but he looked like he might have played himself into some postseason awards against the Jayhawks Steve Jansen BROWN Williams caught four passes for yards all in the first ha lf Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half He did have a yard reverse for a touchdown in the second half for his first rushing TD as a Longhorn But perhaps the most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD receptions this season have averaged yards Five of those TD catches came when Texas was behind or tied The other two came when UT was holding narrow threepoint and sevenpoint leads and provided oomph on the way to victories He may end up on some AllBig second teams because Kansas States Quincy Morgan and AMs Robert Ferguson have been pretty good this season Williams will certainly land on any allnewcomer teams however Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division IA in receiving yards TD catches and yards per catch He ranks second nationally among true freshmen in receptions per game Q I hate to complain about anything after such a good win but whats the story behind our soft defense on opening drives It seems that it takes a series or two for us to settle in Is every team we play coming out in some strange offense that we havent seen on film or something After the first drive adjustments we generally shut everyone down with a couple of obvious exceptions Why cant we andout other teams like they do us on opening drives Cody Anderson Houston BROWN Mack Brown has talked all season about how he tells his team to be prepared for an opposing teams opening surge He said he warned his team about a possible opening surge by Oklahoma before that game and sure enoug h the opening surge became a gamelong surge Warning about the opposing team s opening surge has begged the question Why shouldnt Texas be more concerne d about creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense So far the Longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing teams opening surge before settling down Q Whos fault is it for the drops on short passes from Chris Simms Is it Simms fault for throwing too hard or the receivers for not being able to catch a ball with zip Lawrence Martin BROWN Simms said he is going to start taking something off of those passes He said he doesnt even think about it He said he just throws it not realizing that some of the those short dump passes are being thrown wi th the velocity of a Roger Clemens fastball Simms said he then walks over to the sidelines and hears people saying Can you throw it any harder So lo ok for Simms to tone down the heat on some of those short passes His deep passes however were phenomenal against Kansas Just the right zip Q How long has the TexasTexas Agame not been played on Thanksgivi ng Pete Barnes BROWN UT and Ahave not met on Thanksgiving for seven straight yea rs including this one The UTAgame has been hosted times on Thanksgi ving Day The last four have been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving Texas is in nonThanksgiving Day contests vs AM The last time th e two teams met on Turkey Day was Q Someone was telling me that Texas holds the record for players taken in the NFL draft is that right Randall BROWN Yes Texas has had a player drafted in an NFLrecord straigh t NFL drafts If you

covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about injuries Chris Simms bowl prospects and more Inside UT Football appears on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot After learning that the goal posts had been greased at Texas Tech to kee p fans from tearing them down if the Red Raiders had beaten Texas the Longhorns got some more goal post bulletin board material from Kansas Texas coach Mack Brown told his team about a story that appeared in the Topeka CapitalJournal on Oct about how Kansas players hoped they would be tearing down the goal posts after beating Texas this Saturday At the time KU players quoted in the article had hoped they would be playing Texas for their sixth win making them bowl eligible As it stands the Jayhawks need to beat both Texas and Iowa State Still that didnt keep Mack Brown from telling his team about the arti cle I think thats insulting said UT CB Quentin Jammer Theyll only be let down when it doesnt happen Thats disrespectful said UT CB Rod Babers Its the same thing as Tech lubing up the goal posts Recalling that three teams Baylor Missouri and Oklahoma State tore d own goal posts after beating a UT team in coach Mack Brown called Tex as the goal post team On a related note Brown is taking all kinds of measures to make his te am tougher Texas players wore jackets and head warmers in the cold and rain in Dal las against Oklahoma They will be without such comforts when they travel to Kansas this weekend where temperatures could be in the s When we played in the mist up in Dallas the players had coats on and masks on Mack Brown said Weve taken those away We dont take jackets to the game anymore when its cold No masks nothing Were going to go with pads and helmets and play Were not going to stand around and let the weather b e a factor Brown also wants his team to be up and ready despite playing to a crowd that will likely be sparse at KU on Saturday There wont be anybody there Brown said referring to the fact that KU has averaged fans at home this season KUs largest crowd at Memorial Stadium capacity was for Kansas State on Oct Longhorn Q A Q Since freshman DT Stevie Lee is out for the year now and he still ha s redshirt eligibility can he get a medical redshirt for his injury Rick Orr BROWN Mack Brown said this week that the plan is for Lee foot to se ek a medical redshirt and thus have four years of eligibility after this season IMAGE Shaun Rogers Q I know Shaun Rogers play has been limited since his ankle sprain aga inst Houston How many snaps has he been getting over the last several games At one point during the Tech game I thought I saw Adam Doiron and Marcus Tubb s on the field at the same time playing tackle I know these freshmen are playing great but I figured either Shawn or Casey Hampton would always be on the field to give the line the benefit of their experience Please provide a rundown of the tackle rotation Dan McCrory BROWN Rogers has been getting between and snaps per game But t hat high ankle sprain has really taken a toll Hes not the same player he was before the Houston game Still he wants to stay out on the field even though he is not percent Tubbs and Doiron were out on the field togeth er against Tech for several plays several key plays Mack Brown said Tubbs a nd Doiron had the quickness to hold their own against Techs inexperienced undersized offensive line I dont know how often youll see a tackle tande m that doesnt include Casey Hampton but against Tech the coaches felt they would have to play four defensive ends and four defensive tackles Thats because of the number of pass rushers needed to get pressure on the QB Against a running team you probably would see Hampton as part of the DT tandem in the game Q Can you update us on the injuries Lars Mechlenberg BROWN Major Applewhite is out for Kansas with a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee He is questionable for Texas Aon N ov WR Artie Ellis shin is out for Saturday CB Ervis Hill shoulder is out for the season and may need surgery DT Ryan Haywood shoulder is out for the season and has already undergone surgery SS Lee Jackson quadricep s is questionable and LB OJ McClintock knee is probable Coaches would like to get McClintock back on the field this week on special teams Q I noticed you mentioned in one of your articles that Texas was still trying to put together its first complete game of the season I couldnt agree more I dont recall a season where we really havent played a good game yet this late in the season especially given the talent we are puttin g on the field Im also concerned about the number of penalties we are committing Ive read that Mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and emotion but I watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and remain disciplined Do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just youth Ken Hines Wichita Falls BROWN OG Antwan KirkHughes told me this week that the team thought i t would go out to Stanford and win easily In other words the team took the Cardinal lightly Thus when the Cardinal played the Longhorns tough and ultimately won Texas got tight and struggled I think this season has bee n one with little to get up for The teams on UTs schedule were for the mo st part awful Texas knew going into the season that it was going to be at least a point favorite in every game except for Oklahoma and Texas AM The Longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record Texas Tech My point is once Texas suffered the shock of losing to Stanford it lost some of its sense of urgency Its dream of a national title realistic or unrealistic was over By the time Texas played Oklahoma the Longhorns ha d played only a couple halves of complete football the second half against LouisianaLafayette and the second half against Oklahoma State That wasnt nearly enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the Sooners F or whatever reason some will argue it was the QB rotation the offensive coaches werent able to instill an identity or swagger into their players Whether this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because the team couldnt get up for the Houstons and Baylors of the world only the coaches and players really know But in my opinion Texas has not yet put a complete game together nine games into the season And its because of th e offense The defense has been solid with the exception of Oklahoma The offense has been slow starting erratic and even predictable To UTs credi t the offense is about to set a singleseason passing yardage record by averaging yards passing per game If Texas wins its next two games an d wins its bowl game the Longhorns would be and that would be an improvement over last year and hard to argue with So perhaps Texas can ta ke the fire it showed in the first quarter against Tech and put its first complete game together this week A threegame winning streak to end the season would be a great launch pad into next season when UT will again hav e a chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling dummies Q I am thinking that palm trees and balmy sunsets may be in the Longho rns immediate holiday plans either the Orange Bowl if all goes perfectly or more likely the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego Do you think Mack Brown would relish a game against Rick Neuheisel Texas vs Washington would make for great TV and a wonderful trip for the Horns and their many fans James K Sterrett BROWN This is a better question for next week because well know the outcome of the Texas AMOklahoma game If Oklahoma and Nebraska both win o ut and meet in the Big title game a narrow Nebraska win would probably lan d both in a BCS bowl game A narrow Oklahoma win might still land them both i n the BCS But a lopsided win by either Oklahoma or Nebraska would probably mean the winner going to a BCS bowl game and the loser going to the Cotton If Aloses to Oklahoma and UT beats Kansas the winner of the UTAga me would probably be playing for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl The Holiday Bowl opponent would appear to be either Oregon State or Washington The Alamo Bowl opponent would appear to be either Michigan or Ohio State I think any of those opponents would probably catch the attenti on of Texas except for maybe Oregon State which is really good IMAGE Carl Reese Q Missouri head coach Larry Smith is probably on his way out of Columbi a after this season Carl Reese is a perfect candidate for that position with all of his Missouri ties Do you see coach Reese taking off for Columbia Michael Sampson BROWN Reese has indicated to Mack Brown that he has no interest in becoming a head coach He is getting close to and I think he would like to focus all of his efforts on building a national title contender in Austi n Dont look for Reese to go anywhere Q What is the status of Austin Sendlein I never heard if he redshirte d and I have not heard of him playing David W Rhodes BROWN The Stanford player participation chart showed LB Sendlein play ing But he has not played and will be redshirted this season He is among a handful of players redshirting who the veterans have said look really good in practice The other redshirts drawing raves are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran FB Will Matthews WR Tony Jeffery and OL Lionel Garr Q Is it me or do we get some really sorry calls from the officials I ts always been my opinion that referees calls were just part of the game and if youre not good enough to overcome some bad calls well youre just no t good enough That said however we seem to have some of the worst calls going against us in the last few years and in almost every game Are the officials held to any standard by the Big or an officiating group If its not the officials we have got to do something about all these penalties PM Midland BROWN I too hate talking about penalties But while Mack Brown can t talk about the penalties being called because hell be fined by the Big he can complain to the officials on the field And he can send a videotape of calls that he thinks are questionable to the league office And lets just say Brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this season Brown is calling for instant replay in the college game He said the NFLs instant replay has shown how many calls are missed in a football game He hopes that schools will bite the bullet and vote in favor of this even thou gh it would be a sizable expense to most schools and would slow the game down Brown cant discuss the penalties that have been called on Texas this seaso n but if he could his face would be red and he wouldnt be able to stop talking IMAGE Kenny Hayter Q Is there anything physically wrong with Kenny Hayter that is limiting his playing time Or is this just the coaching staffs decision I will be one of the many to admit that Hodges Mitchell and the offensive line have looked a lot better over the past four games If Hayter had better percarry numbers than Mitchell with an underperforming offensive line it would seem to me that Hayter would also do well now that they are blocking better I would like to point out that I do not advocate benching Mitchell by any means bu t after this weeks game and all of the talk I have heard about him being durable or not I think that a more balanced backfield would help out in th is situation Jason Patton BROWN The coaches have stuck with Mitchell because he is a senior lea der on an offense that doesnt have many leaders and because he is such a versatile threat as a running back and receiver Mitchell has suddenly climbed within yards of a yard rushing season yards and has yards receiving hell surpass last years yards receiving Mitche ll has a yard per carry average the best on the team among RBs except for Brett Robin who has just five carries for yards yards per carry The coaches will stick with Mitchell from here on in because the offense finally showed against Tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first hal f of a game Now granted it was against an undersized defensive line that emphasized its quickness over bulk But Mack Brown seems to think his team is finally getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line of scrimmage Kansas has a salty defensive line led by NG Nate Dwyer So well see if the Longhorns offensive line can continue to push people around Q How does Major Applewhites injury problems effect Chris Simms poss ible redshirt status for next year Monte Boothe BROWN Its too early to tell Mack Brown said he had a conversation w ith Simms about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could seriousl y be considered is after spring practice if not next fall Q It seems that many Horn fans are still in shock from the debac le in the Cotton Bowl and are wondering if OU is suddenly that far ahead of Texas in the development of their respective programs Are they Or was this just a total meltdown by a young UT team Can we expect better results next year a nd if so why Mark Lewisville BROWN I think the OU coaches deserve a lot of credit for getting thei r players to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both side s of the ball That kind of coaching job is what its all about But I dont think you can underestimate the influence that Josh Heupel has had on that team He makes every part of that offense effective Tremendous credit goes to the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on tea ms like Texas Kansas State and Nebraska This has been a phenomenal coaching job And no disrespect to OU but next year without Heupel I think they will drop off slightly maybe Maybe not But it seems likely Q I thought Mack Browns philosophy on redshirts is that he will take them off ANY player at ANY point in the season if we need that player to help us win Does having Beau Trahan as the backup QB for Kansas give us a better chance of winning the game if Simms goes down than Chance Mock From what Mack says Mock is not even a consideration since Courtnee Garcia is the emergency QB Glen Shillinglaw Austin BROWN I think Brown is banking on the fact that Simms survives the Ka nsas game and Major comes back to start or at least back up Simms in an emergenc y situation against Texas AM On Tuesday Mack Brown announced that Hunter McWilliams and not WR Courtnee Garcia would be the teams third quarterback McWilliams the son of former UT coach David McWilliams runs the scout team QB position in practice and has more experience handing off this season than Garcia who was an option QB at Lufkin Brown said he woul d take the redshirt off of Mock if he absolutely had to meaning if both Simm s and Applewhite went down with seasonending injuries But he said to do so right now would be premature because Simms is OK and theres a chance that Applewhite will be back for AM Q Is there any chance for Texas to take the Big South Hopefully A beats OU this weekend this cant hurt BROWN Oklahoma would have to lose two of its last three games at Texa s AM home against Texas Tech or at Oklahoma State Texas would then have to beat Kansas and Texas Ato win the Big South Texas Acan win the Big South title by beating Oklahoma and Texas If you received this newsletter from a

covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the bowl picture UTs quarterback situation Chris Simms next years potential stars and more Inside UT Football appea rs on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot I received several responses to an email from a reader last week regard ing UTs uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them Here are some o f the responses One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their uniforms I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the classiest coolest uniforms in the country I admit to being biased but love the simple nonbusy look of the allwhite uniforms I also have no problem wi th the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested The white helmets with the simple yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as pronounced a s the star on the Dallas Cowboys helmet While I agree with him about the black shoes I think any changes to individualize or otherwise change their look would be a move in the wrong direction Rick Peurifoy I was interested in John Pharrs comments about the UT uniforms Having been at UT in the s I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go I certainly think the best uniforms were in the season perhaps influenc ed by a national championship These were burnt orange jerseys sans individual name on back and TEXAS on the front with the plain white pan ts and orange stockings The white uniform still had the orange stockings but the jersey was white You may remember that Fred Akers brought the candystriped pants ala OU and added the TEXAS to the jersey Personally I like the jersey but think the return of the orange stockings would add something to both uniforms but particularly the road white One amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the uniforms his response was that these are work clothes and not intended t o be fancy I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac k a long way I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the Longhorn in the early s but it didnt add much Keep up the good work I always enjoy your newsletter Tom Thornell Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms I think they are amo ng the sharpest anywhere If we change the helmets then we look like a high school team What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are orange and white Period So what if it doesnt have too much color I hope we stay exactly the same Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an d added orange pants They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field Russell Phillips Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us a look at the bowl picture Sandy Martin BROWN Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday a nd will face either Oregon State or Oregon It will be Oregon State if the Beavers dont get a BCS berth It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BC S berth If OU beats Kansas State look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton Bowl Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl Iowa State would go to the Insightcom Bowl Texas Awould go to the Independence Bowl in Shrevepor t and play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State and Texas Tech wou ld go to the galleryfurniturecom Bowl IMAGE Chris Simms Q Im very happy for Chris Simms but what should we expect from him no w It seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt although one could argue that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year Stil l since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank ed after five passes a redshirt seems like a reach If he doesnt redshirt what is the best guess for Texas QB in I know that you get asked this ever y week but with the new development following the Agame it seems that w e are starting fresh in this story Kyle Moore BROWN Simms bigtime performance against Aadds all kinds of new wrinkles to the landscape for My best guess is Simms will get the start for th e bowl game and well be back in the same situation we were heading into this season Major Applewhites knee injury this time to his right knee again gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms not only now but heading into t he spring and next fall Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldnt rule out a rotation again But one would have to think after the sluggish start the offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be reluctant to do that again Despite breaking nearly every passing record at Texas Applewhite didnt look as sharp as he has in the past during his las t outings before getting injured Simms would seem to have everything going h is way The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie r this season Now that theyve seen it you would have to think that they wa nt to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw o years not stick with a guy who only has one season left Im not saying thats fair But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would think But we wont know how the QB situation for will shake out until next fall most likely Q Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning UT cou ld have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full Do y ou think BJ Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on Did they just blossom during the Agame Otherwise why havent they see n the field more AB BROWN Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season bu t you could certainly argue that UT should use more threereceiver sets next year with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha ve back at those positions There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t he fullback position was pretty average this season So the coaches will take a strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB At and he has the size He is also quick with good hands If Matthews doesnt add significant oomph to the FB position it could be argued that UT should try to use more oneback sets and get its WR talent on the field But well see UT coaches did a nice job of adjusting this season to a twoback tworeceiver set aft er they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers with too many formations and too many quarterbacks Now that the receivers can probably handle more of the playbook look for UT to be as multiple and complex an offense as possible next season BJ Johnson finished the year as the team s secondleading receiver so he saw the field plenty Sloan Thomas was the o ne who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions and be ready to fill in at any of them So he was slowed by the learning process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and Brandon Healy Healy is a senior so hell be gone next year Flowers shoul d be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking Q Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are either redshirting or transferred Bart Fields BROWN Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer Kyle Shanahan the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan Simms said both will really help the team a lot next year Jeffery is and trying t o bulk up from pounds Shanahan is and trying to bulk up from pounds But both have shown great hands in practice The first two names th at jumped off of Mack Browns lips when asked about players to watch in bowl practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas With Texas losing four linebackers after next season DeAnd re Lewis Everick Rawls Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones Brown said some new faces will have to play a bunch in to be ready to become starters at linebacker in two years Q Im a little concerned about our running backs Next years crop loo ks mighty inexperienced We never seemed to be able to run up the middle consistently this year Who would you figure has the best shot at being an inside bruiser What role will our fullbacks play Russell Phillips BROWN Its the biggest question mark on an offense that should be absolutely loaded next season I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov er at tackle nicely Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar r has lost about pounds from to and looks good So with a line that should continue to improve the Longhorns just need a back who can run behind it Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility Coaches want Victor Ike Ken ny Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up Coaches have told those three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce consistently IMAGE Sloan Thomas Q With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has is there enough room at wideo ut for Artie Ellis next season Frank Seles BROWN Dont be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season At and more than pounds he is a bit undersized but could add the weight His speed would give Texas the surehanded deepthreat tight end they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife It may be a longshot but don t be surprised Q While watching the AMUT game I noticed that UT received the ball at the opening kickoff and the secondhalf kickoff And UT got the wind at its back in the th quarter How did this happen and if Awon the toss why would the Aggies choose to defer give UT the ball at both kickoffs and go into the wind in the nd and th quarters Ryan M Austin BROWN Texas Awon the toss at the beginning of the game and chose the wind at its back giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter The Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter and took the ball into the wind Q Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team co ach UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams This year the Longhorns would have been and possibly on their way to a BCS game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown against Stanford With money apparently not being a factor I really do not understand why Brown doesnt break down and hire some specialized help Don Stevenson Huntington Texas BROWN I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan which is to divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches IMAGE DeAndre Lewis making the tackle Q Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is f or a winning team Weve had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer a nd James Brown whose onfield performances may have been surpassed by their offfield contributions I think were losing a lot of leadership this year when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave Of the returning players who does it look like will step up as team leaders next year Keith Heugatter BROWN On defense Mack Brown said hell look for Cory Redding and De Andre Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers and Greg Brown On offense UT will look to its quarterback its young receiver s and linemen such as Antwan KirkHughes of Waxahachie for leadership Q What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season Steve Beauchamp BROWN The obvious ones are Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers Greg Brown H odges Mitchell and Leonard Davis But the one that may be missed the most is Kris Stockton He kicked several gamewinning field goals two years ago and has done nothing but continue to break records since He has been an afterthoug ht because he has been so automatic on field goals He has also done an excellent job of punting this season Matt McFadden a redshirt freshman will handle the kicking duties next year And at punter redshirt freshman Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed to the Longhorns for next year That will be a huge question mark for Texas to answer next season Q Who do you pick in the Kansas StateOU game Seems like OU is missin g its October magic Id have to take OU in a close one Heupel isnt grea t but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offens e in the pros Andrew Bowen BROWN I too think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue its Shock the World season Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman The vote s are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum Q Can you give us an update on the mens and womens basketball teams Lucius Thornton BROWN The mens team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victor ies over Navy California and Indiana any of which could help the Longhorns down the road at tournament time The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT but coach Rick Barnes was able to prove a point to his team about being intimidated As of Tuesday nights game with UTSan Antonio Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup point guard Royal Ivey small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thoma s Duncanvilles Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward Chri s Owens has been a shotblocking force and transfer Maurice Evans is the teams leading scorer and is starting to hit a better percentage from the floor The mens team doesnt have another test until Dec when the team plays at South Florida Other games worth watching or getting tickets for include home games against Illinois Dec and Utah Dec The women s team has also gotten off to a nice start with its only earlyseason loss coming against Purdue The womens team is relying on several newcomers including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings The team i s also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard So both teams are young with a lot of upside If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter

Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Buy all your UT team gear at our EFanshopcom Chip Shot One of the most intriguing matchups to watch in this years Culligan Hol iday Bowl at San Diego will take place on the sidelines with Texas coach Mack Brown going up against Oregons Mike Bellotti You may not know much about Bellotti but know this about his tenure at Oregon in six years he has a record and those wins are more th an any other Pac school during that time period And over the last four seasons Oregon is with four consecutive bowl game appearances The Ducks two losses this season were by a combined total of points vs Wisconsin and at Oregon State Brown certainly is impressed by Bellottis success at Oregon Mike Bellotti is a personal friend Brown said in a news release from UTs sports information office He took over for Rich Brooks at Oregon a number of years ago when they were representing the Pac in the Rose Bowl for th e first time in a long time He has done a great job building on that success each of his years as head coach It will be fun to be around him and his te am throughout the week Added Holiday Bowl president Jim Philion Coach Bellotti has built the Ducks into one of the premiere football programs in the country The game this Dec against Texas will increase an already exciting rivalry betwee n the Pac and the Big Longhorn fans can purchase tickets to the Culligan Holiday Bowl by contacting the UT ticket office BEVO or by logging on to the athletics department Web site wwwTexasSportscom Longhorn Q A Q Longhorn officials will probably not say which bowl they would prefer to play in but were any of their options less desirable becau se of dates travel ticket sales or impressing recruits Todd Davis BROWN The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl I know that sounds like Well of course thats what they would say But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the Kansas game by saying if UT won out they would go to the Holiday Bowl a fun sunny destination against a top team Aside from the beach balls an d surfing the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game For instance Chris Simms was paid by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to the Cotton Bowl last year So hell really clean up this year Not that he needs it But you get the picture Its a way for some of the players to ma ke a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an d pocket the rest The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on their own The team will not charter a flight All players have to be checked into the team hotel in San Diego by pm on Dec Mack Brown wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would w in the Big South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top team And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team Last year Texas and its fans couldnt seem to get fired up for an unranked Arkansas team in the Cotton Bowl one year after having played in the same game So believe it when UT says the Holiday Bowl is where it wanted t o be IMAGE Casey Hampton Q How high do you think Casey Hampton will go in the NFL draft I woul d think hes a cinch first rounder Could he go in the top five BROWN Hampton could go in the first or second round The second round might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive linemen coming out this year But Hampton has been really watching his weig ht and trying to improve his speed He promised me that scouts at the NFL combine will be surprised when they see him work out Hampton is a great story The guy just works his tail off and knows that his height slightly more than will probably play against him So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNewsco m ran before the Texas Agame The film dont lie If you can show me whe re my height has hurt me its on you I would be surprised if Hampton fell to t he third round Q Lets see now Rose Bowl Cotton Bowl Sugar Bowl Orange B owl Fiesta Bowl Galleryfurniturecom Bowl Which one does NOT give you cold chills just to think about RR BROWN At least the galleryfurniturecom Bowl is not called the Poulan Weedeater Bowl a name that still haunts the nowSanford Independence Bowl where Texas Awill meet up with former coach Jackie Sherrill this year We have to hope the furniture bowl which will be played in the Houston Astrodome fairs better than the old Bluebonnet Bowl which went bankrupt a nd failed to pay Texas and Pittsburgh their purses for the game won by U T That was the last bowl game ever played in Houston Q Texas quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thi ng manufactured by the illfated rotation scheme Now however the quarterba ck controversy is real Texas now has two genuine starting quarterbacks Chri s Simms is no longer the next boy wonder He has arrived Does ANYONE in the nation have a better quarterback tandem than Texas How in the world is Ma ck Brown going to deal with this If they keep the simplified offensive schem e next year do you think the QB rotation could resurface and actually work Rowell Rogers Denton Texas BROWN I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penn y of his salary because of the quarterback situation And hell earn every penny again next year Unless unforseen circumstances such as injuries dictate otherwise I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next year And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms next year He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite just as Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton If Simms starts t he bowl game and Texas plays well and wins Simms will have done nothing to lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com e in and relieve him then we are back to square one with both guys battling it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter Texas coaches have said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this season because of his experience So well see if their stance has changed Q The yard pumpandgo TD play from Chris Simms to BJ Johnson is both a validation of Simms abilities AND an indictment of the quarterback rotation Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played every offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the defensive player responsible To my mind that is a strong argument agains t any kind of QB rotation scheme But on the other hand how can one NOT wa nt to play both of these immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible Can we get a rule change to allow two footballs on the field at once ha ha BROWN The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota tion next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris h whenever he is on the field But his comments all season have directly and indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence didnt come around until he was taking all the snaps So I dont know if th e coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his confidence IMAGE Mack Brown Q What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach I noticed earl ier in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Browns ability to fire up the tea m assuming that Texas has more talented players I think that he has proven that he can win big games but he has also had some surprising slipups Bro wn is unquestionably a great recruiter but do you question his leadership ability on gameday Andrew Wootton BROWN Up until the Texas Tech game Mack Brown was saying things like We could lose any game we play I just dont know which team is going to show up We could go or Those kinds of comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the Longhorns Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any coach Ive been around So when he was saying things like that it made you wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity Clearly this ye ar was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense The defens e was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge But the offense really struggled to find an identity Part of that was the quarterback rotation Part of it was having young receivers and part of it was having a bunch of guys with lowkey personalities ie Hodges Mitchell Leonard Davis Antwa n KirkHughes Derrick Dockery Mike Williams etc Mack Brown even said it was the quietest bunch of offensive players hed been around Once Mack Bro wn and Co decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t he starter Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as anything else I think Mack Brown is a great coach Let me say that again He is a grea t coach I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi p on the field The more he rotated the QBs the less chance the offense had to develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit h learning their responsibilities in fourwide as well as trying to adjust to having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle The offensive linemen earl y on also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi m Im sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly than it did Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he played Simms more in the Stanford game an outing in which Applewhite real ly struggled until the fourth quarter Against Oklahoma the Sooners executed flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldnt get up from It was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo n in Austin according to many But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati ng out of his hand any time he wants All he has to do is tune out the negativ e comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say We are doing the best we can We learn We make mistakes Were going to keep trying harder Those are comments no negative fan can argue with Instead Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint everything about this season Each press conference was filled with a comme nt about how the media and fans had beat up this years team It was contentious Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times Paterno hates the media rarely gives out interviews etc So if Mack Brown is following in Paternos footsteps on that issue it would be a shame Paterno doesnt have onequillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow n Brown got tough questions during his radio callin show this season Som e weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others But a guy like Brown is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off of his back use that selfdeprecating laugh of his and then take his frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi s team into a juggernaut Mack Brown should know his teams personality going into next year because so many players will be back And hell have this ye ar as a blueprint of how not to do things in many instances And hes where h e wants to be at a major college football power and always being in the position of favorite At North Carolina as well as he recruited and coache d Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood At Texa s he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big Now Oklahoma has come charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without excuses If you notice Stoops didnt gripe about having to play the Big title game and possibly ruin his teams national title chances He didnt gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in Kansas City He has a tough attitude and his team has adopted his attitude Brown has a tough attitude too And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and all of next season will be the truest test of Browns coaching and dealing with expectations Brown said fairly and accurately that Texas couldnt b e expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadnt finished a season in the top since How do you jump to No witho ut having first been in the top Brown said before the season Does this kind of talk trickle into the ears of players I dont know Most of the Longhorns before the season Applewhite and Hampton included felt like Tex as could win the national title Thats one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam e back to Texas this season When UT lost to Stanford Brown emerged from an emotionally blasted locker room and said I didnt think this was a nation al title team He went on to say the team was too young Are these excuses fo r his team If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl the Longhorns will hav e their top finish and will once again be ranked in the top heading int o next season On defense the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca sey Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on But Marcus Tubbs Adam Doiron a nd Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better and there is a wealth of talent in the seven guys behind them On offense the big question mark is at running back where Hodges Mitchell is moving on Hes a guy some Texas fan s still think is worthless But let me tell you he isnt Hes got guts and gave everything he had It may take some time to see another back who can catch and run the way he does UT will have several backs to pick from including freshmantobe Cedric Benson The rest of the team is proven and will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end I dont see any excuses for this team next year National championship t alk will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda Heres hoping that Mac k Brown doesnt let the nitpickers bog him down And I include myself in that group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact s positive or negative Heres to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl e negative angles in a newspaper story Heres to hoping that hell take on critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily basis Places like Texas Alabama and Ohio State have fans who are seemingl y never satisfied Until Brown wins a national championship UT fans will secondguess and doubt and wonder why something else wasnt tried That cou ld continue even if he wins a national title But thats sports Its worse no w because there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the Internet and allday talk radio Mack Brown lives under a microscope Fans think the y are as smart as coaches because they manage a fantasy football team Brown just has to shrug off the naysayers and focus on the reasons he loves coaching Q Among UTs current commitments who do you see as the freshmen most likely to see significant playing time next year BROWN The more I see and hear about Midland Lee running back Cedric Benson the more I think he has the best chance to have an impact next year He appears to have the kind of vision that makes running backs special Q Only two teams had a strength of schedule rating above in the BC S rankings and all the top five teams had a sub rating Given that UT has a decent chance in the national championship race next year what if anythi ng can UT do to help raise its strength of schedule rating Seems like the Longhorns could go undefeated and still be on the outside looking in Andrew Bowen BROWN Well gauging by how some of the BCS polls had Florida State hi gher than Oklahoma I think its fair to say that strength of schedule is a concern for Texas next year I think Texas has to win all its games next season to make sure that it is not in the position of Miami which beat Florida State but is not in the national championship picture If Texas goe s next season the Longhorns could very well not be in control of their own destiny With their schedule as crazy and inflatedexpectationriddled as this sounds the Longhorns would probably need to win all the games to ensure getting a shot at the national championship next season IMAGE Leonard Davis Q Who will be drafted off this team Any first rounders Will the draft distract the seniors from the bowl game Will any juniors declare early Is the NFL looking at any underclassmen on the team Lance Grand Prairie BROWN The obvious draft picks are OT Leonard Davis DT Casey Hampton and DT Shaun Rogers SS Greg Brown may also get a look from an NFL team after t he year he has had I think Davis is a firstround pick for sure Hampton and Rogers shouldnt fall past the second round although they could simply because there are a number of top defensive lineman in next years NFL draft NFL scouts are intrigued by junior Quenti n Jammer because of his size and physical play at cornerback NFL scouts like junior DeAndre Lewis speed and size at linebacker But UT officials seem confident that no underclassmen will jump from this years team Q Please discuss the coaching staffs approach to bowl games Did we approach the Mississippi State Cotton Bowl with a different philosophy or attitude than the Arkansas Cotton Bowl What is our attitude about Oregon a nd the Holiday Bowl Keith Heugatter BROWN The Cotton Bowl after the season was the final chapter to a storybook season That team was riding the euphoria of Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy and felt like it was on top of the world The team that face d Arkansas in last Januarys Cotton Bowl had lost two straight and then found itself back in Dallas feeling a little unsure about itself against an Arkansas team looking for its first bowl victory since This season Texas is riding a sixgame winning streak finally got the breakout game it was looking for from Chris Simms and really wants to win its bowl game to finish in the top for the first time in years I would be surprised very surprised if Texas comes out flat and doesnt make a good showing in the Holiday Bowl Even though they dont know much about Oregon the Longhorns know the Ducks are ranked higher than they are Thats all they need to know If the players can avoid the trouble they ran into before las t years Cotton Bowl suspensions to two team leaders Aaron Humphrey and Kwa me Cavil as well as JJ Kelly and Jamal Joyner I think Texas will be stron g and focused Q Is Leonard Davis up for any major awards this season Clark Routier BROWN Longhorn OT Leonard Davis is one of three finalists for the Out land Trophy The award will be presented live on Thursday night pm Central on the ESPN College Football Awards Show at Disney World Davis ha s been tabbed a firstteam AllAmerican by The Football Writers Association Walter Camp Football Foundation and Sporting News Q Can you give us an update on the mens basketball team Shirley Lively BROWN The mens team is starting to come together and could get a hug e boost in the next couple of weeks if senior Darren Kelly can regain his eligibility The semester ends Dec but coach Rick Barnes isnt sure wh en hell find out if Kelly has made his grades and regained his academic standing for next semester One thing is for sure Barnes believes the Longhorns will only get better with Kelly in the lineup He said Kelly dominates in practice with his dribble penetration and quickness He said Kelly would help players like junior transfer Maurice Evans Evans by the way has continued to look more comfortable in the Longhorns offense He w as named the Phillips Big Conference Rookie of the Week the league offi ce announced Tuesday The junior transfer earned the award by averaging points per game while hitting of field goals including of threepointers during Texas two victories over UTSan Antonio and Southwest Texas State last week The honor is chosen by a panel of media observers who cover Big mens basketball Evans had a seasonhigh points on of shooting of threes vs UTSan Antonio before posti ng points on of shooting of threes against Southwest Texas The lone Longhorn to reach doublefigure scoring in each of UTs first six contests he leads the team in scoring ppg and ranks third in rebounding rpg and blocks five Texas returns to action when it travels to Tampa Fla to face South Florida on Saturday Dec Tipoff is

covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about injuries Chris Simms bowl prospects and more Inside UT Football appears on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot After learning that the goal posts had been greased at Texas Tech to kee p fans from tearing them down if the Red Raiders had beaten Texas the Longhorns got some more goal post bulletin board material from Kansas Texas coach Mack Brown told his team about a story that appeared in the Topeka CapitalJournal on Oct about how Kansas players hoped they would be tearing down the goal posts after beating Texas this Saturday At the time KU players quoted in the article had hoped they would be playing Texas for their sixth win making them bowl eligible As it stands the Jayhawks need to beat both Texas and Iowa State Still that didnt keep Mack Brown from telling his team about the arti cle I think thats insulting said UT CB Quentin Jammer Theyll only be let down when it doesnt happen Thats disrespectful said UT CB Rod Babers Its the same thing as Tech lubing up the goal posts Recalling that three teams Baylor Missouri and Oklahoma State tore d own goal posts after beating a UT team in coach Mack Brown called Tex as the goal post team On a related note Brown is taking all kinds of measures to make his te am tougher Texas players wore jackets and head warmers in the cold and rain in Dal las against Oklahoma They will be without such comforts when they travel to Kansas this weekend where temperatures could be in the s When we played in the mist up in Dallas the players had coats on and masks on Mack Brown said Weve taken those away We dont take jackets to the game anymore when its cold No masks nothing Were going to go with pads and helmets and play Were not going to stand around and let the weather b e a factor Brown also wants his team to be up and ready despite playing to a crowd that will likely be sparse at KU on Saturday There wont be anybody there Brown said referring to the fact that KU has averaged fans at home this season KUs largest crowd at Memorial Stadium capacity was for Kansas State on Oct Longhorn Q A Q Since freshman DT Stevie Lee is out for the year now and he still ha s redshirt eligibility can he get a medical redshirt for his injury Rick Orr BROWN Mack Brown said this week that the plan is for Lee foot to se ek a medical redshirt and thus have four years of eligibility after this season IMAGE Shaun Rogers Q I know Shaun Rogers play has been limited since his ankle sprain aga inst Houston How many snaps has he been getting over the last several games At one point during the Tech game I thought I saw Adam Doiron and Marcus Tubb s on the field at the same time playing tackle I know these freshmen are playing great but I figured either Shawn or Casey Hampton would always be on the field to give the line the benefit of their experience Please provide a rundown of the tackle rotation Dan McCrory BROWN Rogers has been getting between and snaps per game But t hat high ankle sprain has really taken a toll Hes not the same player he was before the Houston game Still he wants to stay out on the field even though he is not percent Tubbs and Doiron were out on the field togeth er against Tech for several plays several key plays Mack Brown said Tubbs a nd Doiron had the quickness to hold their own against Techs inexperienced undersized offensive line I dont know how often youll see a tackle tande m that doesnt include Casey Hampton but against Tech the coaches felt they would have to play four defensive ends and four defensive tackles Thats because of the number of pass rushers needed to get pressure on the QB Against a running team you probably would see Hampton as part of the DT tandem in the game Q Can you update us on the injuries Lars Mechlenberg BROWN Major Applewhite is out for Kansas with a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee He is questionable for Texas Aon N ov WR Artie Ellis shin is out for Saturday CB Ervis Hill shoulder is out for the season and may need surgery DT Ryan Haywood shoulder is out for the season and has already undergone surgery SS Lee Jackson quadricep s is questionable and LB OJ McClintock knee is probable Coaches would like to get McClintock back on the field this week on special teams Q I noticed you mentioned in one of your articles that Texas was still trying to put together its first complete game of the season I couldnt agree more I dont recall a season where we really havent played a good game yet this late in the season especially given the talent we are puttin g on the field Im also concerned about the number of penalties we are committing Ive read that Mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and emotion but I watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and remain disciplined Do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just youth Ken Hines Wichita Falls BROWN OG Antwan KirkHughes told me this week that the team thought i t would go out to Stanford and win easily In other words the team took the Cardinal lightly Thus when the Cardinal played the Longhorns tough and ultimately won Texas got tight and struggled I think this season has bee n one with little to get up for The teams on UTs schedule were for the mo st part awful Texas knew going into the season that it was going to be at least a point favorite in every game except for Oklahoma and Texas AM The Longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record Texas Tech My point is once Texas suffered the shock of losing to Stanford it lost some of its sense of urgency Its dream of a national title realistic or unrealistic was over By the time Texas played Oklahoma the Longhorns ha d played only a couple halves of complete football the second half against LouisianaLafayette and the second half against Oklahoma State That wasnt nearly enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the Sooners F or whatever reason some will argue it was the QB rotation the offensive coaches werent able to instill an identity or swagger into their players Whether this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because the team couldnt get up for the Houstons and Baylors of the world only the coaches and players really know But in my opinion Texas has not yet put a complete game together nine games into the season And its because of th e offense The defense has been solid with the exception of Oklahoma The offense has been slow starting erratic and even predictable To UTs credi t the offense is about to set a singleseason passing yardage record by averaging yards passing per game If Texas wins its next two games an d wins its bowl game the Longhorns would be and that would be an improvement over last year and hard to argue with So perhaps Texas can ta ke the fire it showed in the first quarter against Tech and put its first complete game together this week A threegame winning streak to end the season would be a great launch pad into next season when UT will again hav e a chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling dummies Q I am thinking that palm trees and balmy sunsets may be in the Longho rns immediate holiday plans either the Orange Bowl if all goes perfectly or more likely the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego Do you think Mack Brown would relish a game against Rick Neuheisel Texas vs Washington would make for great TV and a wonderful trip for the Horns and their many fans James K Sterrett BROWN This is a better question for next week because well know the outcome of the Texas AMOklahoma game If Oklahoma and Nebraska both win o ut and meet in the Big title game a narrow Nebraska win would probably lan d both in a BCS bowl game A narrow Oklahoma win might still land them both i n the BCS But a lopsided win by either Oklahoma or Nebraska would probably mean the winner going to a BCS bowl game and the loser going to the Cotton If Aloses to Oklahoma and UT beats Kansas the winner of the UTAga me would probably be playing for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl The Holiday Bowl opponent would appear to be either Oregon State or Washington The Alamo Bowl opponent would appear to be either Michigan or Ohio State I think any of those opponents would probably catch the attenti on of Texas except for maybe Oregon State which is really good IMAGE Carl Reese Q Missouri head coach Larry Smith is probably on his way out of Columbi a after this season Carl Reese is a perfect candidate for that position with all of his Missouri ties Do you see coach Reese taking off for Columbia Michael Sampson BROWN Reese has indicated to Mack Brown that he has no interest in becoming a head coach He is getting close to and I think he would like to focus all of his efforts on building a national title contender in Austi n Dont look for Reese to go anywhere Q What is the status of Austin Sendlein I never heard if he redshirte d and I have not heard of him playing David W Rhodes BROWN The Stanford player participation chart showed LB Sendlein play ing But he has not played and will be redshirted this season He is among a handful of players redshirting who the veterans have said look really good in practice The other redshirts drawing raves are QB Chance Mock RB Sneezy Beltran FB Will Matthews WR Tony Jeffery and OL Lionel Garr Q Is it me or do we get some really sorry calls from the officials I ts always been my opinion that referees calls were just part of the game and if youre not good enough to overcome some bad calls well youre just no t good enough That said however we seem to have some of the worst calls going against us in the last few years and in almost every game Are the officials held to any standard by the Big or an officiating group If its not the officials we have got to do something about all these penalties PM Midland BROWN I too hate talking about penalties But while Mack Brown can t talk about the penalties being called because hell be fined by the Big he can complain to the officials on the field And he can send a videotape of calls that he thinks are questionable to the league office And lets just say Brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this season Brown is calling for instant replay in the college game He said the NFLs instant replay has shown how many calls are missed in a football game He hopes that schools will bite the bullet and vote in favor of this even thou gh it would be a sizable expense to most schools and would slow the game down Brown cant discuss the penalties that have been called on Texas this seaso n but if he could his face would be red and he wouldnt be able to stop talking IMAGE Kenny Hayter Q Is there anything physically wrong with Kenny Hayter that is limiting his playing time Or is this just the coaching staffs decision I will be one of the many to admit that Hodges Mitchell and the offensive line have looked a lot better over the past four games If Hayter had better percarry numbers than Mitchell with an underperforming offensive line it would seem to me that Hayter would also do well now that they are blocking better I would like to point out that I do not advocate benching Mitchell by any means bu t after this weeks game and all of the talk I have heard about him being durable or not I think that a more balanced backfield would help out in th is situation Jason Patton BROWN The coaches have stuck with Mitchell because he is a senior lea der on an offense that doesnt have many leaders and because he is such a versatile threat as a running back and receiver Mitchell has suddenly climbed within yards of a yard rushing season yards and has yards receiving hell surpass last years yards receiving Mitche ll has a yard per carry average the best on the team among RBs except for Brett Robin who has just five carries for yards yards per carry The coaches will stick with Mitchell from here on in because the offense finally showed against Tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first hal f of a game Now granted it was against an undersized defensive line that emphasized its quickness over bulk But Mack Brown seems to think his team is finally getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line of scrimmage Kansas has a salty defensive line led by NG Nate Dwyer So well see if the Longhorns offensive line can continue to push people around Q How does Major Applewhites injury problems effect Chris Simms poss ible redshirt status for next year Monte Boothe BROWN Its too early to tell Mack Brown said he had a conversation w ith Simms about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could seriousl y be considered is after spring practice if not next fall Q It seems that many Horn fans are still in shock from the debac le in the Cotton Bowl and are wondering if OU is suddenly that far ahead of Texas in the development of their respective programs Are they Or was this just a total meltdown by a young UT team Can we expect better results next year a nd if so why Mark Lewisville BROWN I think the OU coaches deserve a lot of credit for getting thei r players to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both side s of the ball That kind of coaching job is what its all about But I dont think you can underestimate the influence that Josh Heupel has had on that team He makes every part of that offense effective Tremendous credit goes to the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on tea ms like Texas Kansas State and Nebraska This has been a phenomenal coaching job And no disrespect to OU but next year without Heupel I think they will drop off slightly maybe Maybe not But it seems likely Q I thought Mack Browns philosophy on redshirts is that he will take them off ANY player at ANY point in the season if we need that player to help us win Does having Beau Trahan as the backup QB for Kansas give us a better chance of winning the game if Simms goes down than Chance Mock From what Mack says Mock is not even a consideration since Courtnee Garcia is the emergency QB Glen Shillinglaw Austin BROWN I think Brown is banking on the fact that Simms survives the Ka nsas game and Major comes back to start or at least back up Simms in an emergenc y situation against Texas AM On Tuesday Mack Brown announced that Hunter McWilliams and not WR Courtnee Garcia would be the teams third quarterback McWilliams the son of former UT coach David McWilliams runs the scout team QB position in practice and has more experience handing off this season than Garcia who was an option QB at Lufkin Brown said he woul d take the redshirt off of Mock if he absolutely had to meaning if both Simm s and Applewhite went down with seasonending injuries But he said to do so right now would be premature because Simms is OK and theres a chance that Applewhite will be back for AM Q Is there any chance for Texas to take the Big South Hopefully A beats OU this weekend this cant hurt BROWN Oklahoma would have to lose two of its last three games at Texa s AM home against Texas Tech or at Oklahoma State Texas would then have to beat Kansas and Texas Ato win the Big South Texas Acan win the Big South title by beating Oklahoma and Texas If you received this newsletter from a

covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the Hex Rally next years schedule Chris Simms bowl prospects recruiting Texas Aand more Inside UT Football appears on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot Thirteen senior Longhorns will be playing their final home game when Tex as meets Texas Aon Friday Nov They will be honored in a pregame ceremony Among the seniors playing their final home game are six current starters Free safety Greg Brown of Baton Rouge La offensive tackle Leonard Da vis of Wortham defensive tackle Casey Hampton of Galveston Ball running back Hodges Mitchell of Skyline defensive tackle Shaun Rogers of LaPorte and placekicker Kris Stockton of Katy Five other seniors who have seen significant playing time are Wide receiver Brandon Healy of Carlsbad Calif punter Ryan Long of Richardson Pearce offensive tackle Cory Quye of San Antonio Marshall wide receiver Jamel Thompson of Skyline and safety Joe Walker of Galena Park North Shore Other seniors playing their final game are Linebacker Scott Emley of San Antonio Churchill and defensive back Marc us Walther of Hillcrest Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us the history behind the Hex Rally And also when is it this year Margot Linney BROWN According to the Texas sports information office the Hex Rally will be held Monday Nov at pm on the universitys main mall in front o f the UT Tower For years the TexasTexas A game featured bonfires at bo th schools But the environmentalists won out in Austin causing the end to th e bonfire for UT students In place of the traditional bonfire Texas turned instead to an old story to start a new tradition In Texas had not beaten Texas Aat Kyle Field since A group of students turned to a n Austin fortune teller named Mrs August Hipple who gave them the prescription for victory Burn red candles she said The burning of the candles she thought would show the great support for the team Texas won and the red candle legend was born The candle burning lay dormant until when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU game and the Longhorns upset No SMU It was back in the boxes fo r the candles after that until when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was unbeaten and seeking its firstever SWC title Texas blocked an extra point after the first score and won The red candles are the most potent whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked wrote Tim e magazine after the upset In Texas was driving for its first unbeaten season in modern history and the possibility of a national championship as it hosted Baylor For three of the previous four years UT had been in the same position on the verge of a perfect year only to be upset Out came the red candles one more time and UT won Bonfires ended in Austin in the late s and seeking a new tradition the hex rallies were started in IMAGE Chris Simms Q So far this season Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that we re returned for touchdowns if you count the return on the failed twopoint conversion attempt last week in Kansas Can you help explain what Chris is doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem Also has Chris set a school record in this statistic I enjoy the newsletter Jeff Cookston BROWN Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking onto his intended receiver too early in his drop back He will look away from hi s intended receiver but only for a split second He needs to look off the defense better an d he also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage He suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre He sees a receiver in double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and returned for a TD against Kansas He said he should have thrown it away He said hes learning He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas is at an alltime high So thats good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up getting the start against Texas AM Q I have heard that next years schedule is just about as weak as this years Can you either give it to us or let us know where on the Web to fi nd it Steve Davis BROWN The schedule is as follows Sept New Mexico State Sep t North Carolina Sept at Houston Sept Texas Tech Oct Oklahom a in Dallas Oct at Oklahoma State Oct Colorado Oct at Missouri Nov at Baylor Nov Kansas and Nov or at Texas AM Q Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle To his credit he maintained that two QBs were better than one At this stage and based on Chris Simms recent games it would seem to me that Brown was correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five games in a row Also Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simm s motivated What do you think Charley Davis Southlake Texas BROWN I think the rotation is now paying off But I still stand by my belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in t he year Mack Brown said the rotation didnt work as well as it could have because this years team lacked senior leadership At North Carolina Brown said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older Anyway theres no doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year A nd Simms is definitely still happy at Texas No chance of him transferring Q Can you update us on UTs injuries Ken BROWN As of right now Major Applewhites right knee sprain is keepin g him out of practice this week and he is questionable for the Agame SS Lee Jackson hamstring is probable TE Brock Edwards leg and WR Artie Ellis shin are questionable DT Stevie Lee foot is out and will seek a medica l redshirt for this season a move that would give him four years of eligibility remaining IMAGE Cedric Benson in white uniform Q Id like an update on recruiting our commitments our prospects and how you think we will finish Matt Dunnahoo BROWN Texas has oral commitments with roughly six or seven scholar ships remaining There are recruits left who have either been offered a scholarship or who are strongly considering Texas They are DT Tommie Harr is of Killeen Ellison LB Derrick Johnson of Waco DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia Calif TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson both of Galena Park North Shore OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville OL William Winston of Houston Madison S Dwayne Brandon o f Temple athlete Quan Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Brossard of Blinn JC Johnson Jakes Moses Jackson and Brandon are strong Texas leans at this point Most of those players will visit Texas on the weekend of Dec the same weekend as the UT football banquet Texas oral commitments are from the following studentathletes OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter OL Abe Robinson Jersey Village OL Alfio Randall Blinn JC OL Mike Garcia Galena Park OL Will Allen Cypress Falls OL Roman Reeves Livingston OL Terrance Young Longview QB Matt Nordgren Dallas Bishop Lynch RB Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson DE Eric Hal l Clarksville Tenn LB Yamil LeBron Kille en Ellison LB Lance McFarland Jefferson DB Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes DB Aaron Ross Tyler DB Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship DB Braden Johnson Euless Trinity DB Brian Carter The Woodlands P Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC Q Which bowl do you see UT ending up in I know that the secondplace team in the Big goes to the Cotton Bowl What place would Texas be if we defeated AM I remember that when Abeat Kansas State a few years ago KState ended up in the Alamo Bowl and UT played in the Cotton Bowl Is the re a chance of a repeat of that if OU beats KState in the Big championship game Mike Thakur BROWN If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big title game there s a chance both teams will get into the BCS Nebraska would then be the likely choice for the Cotton Bowl and the TexasTexas Awinner would be the li kely choice for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl But there are rumblings that Nebraska isnt excited about the Cotton Bowl and would rather go to the Holiday Bowl That could send the UTAwinner to the Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix Ariz If Oklahoma beats Kansas State the Wildcats would have thre e losses including one to Texas AM That means the Wildcats would probably drop to the Insightcom Bowl And the winner of the UTAgame would go t o either the Holiday or the Cotton with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl T he Holiday opponent would be either Oregon or Oregon State The Alamo opponent would likely be Michigan or Ohio State Q Dont you think Texas has a huge advantage over my Fighting Texas Ag gies for the following reasons UTs playing at home Jason Glenn Robert Ferguson and Sammy Davis three of the Aggies best players are going to be out for the game and AMs coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma i n the biggest game of the year on a national stage It will be hard to recove r from that It looks as if Texas has everything going for it I believe if Awould have beaten Oklahoma there is not any way Texas beats Awhen the Big south crown is on the line Justin S Schwertner BROWN I dont see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahom a loss They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence fro m that game The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss or diminished ability of Glenn Ferguson and Davis Glenn the teams sack leader and a spirited leader at linebacker is out for sure with a knee injury that will require surgery If Ferguson one of the top receivers in the Big and Davis a top cornerback for the Aggies indeed cannot play those are big hurdles to overcome for AM Playing in Austin helps Texas But this game will probably come down to who runs the ball best Look for this to be a showdown between JaMar Toombs and Hodges Mitchell IMAGE Roy Williams Q I thought Roy Williams was good before the Kansas game but he looked like he might have played himself into some postseason awards against the Jayhawks Steve Jansen BROWN Williams caught four passes for yards all in the first ha lf Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half He did have a yard reverse for a touchdown in the second half for his first rushing TD as a Longhorn But perhaps the most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD receptions this season have averaged yards Five of those TD catches came when Texas was behind or tied The other two came when UT was holding narrow threepoint and sevenpoint leads and provided oomph on the way to victories He may end up on some AllBig second teams because Kansas States Quincy Morgan and AMs Robert Ferguson have been pretty good this season Williams will certainly land on any allnewcomer teams however Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division IA in receiving yards TD catches and yards per catch He ranks second nationally among true freshmen in receptions per game Q I hate to complain about anything after such a good win but whats the story behind our soft defense on opening drives It seems that it takes a series or two for us to settle in Is every team we play coming out in some strange offense that we havent seen on film or something After the first drive adjustments we generally shut everyone down with a couple of obvious exceptions Why cant we andout other teams like they do us on opening drives Cody Anderson Houston BROWN Mack Brown has talked all season about how he tells his team to be prepared for an opposing teams opening surge He said he warned his team about a possible opening surge by Oklahoma before that game and sure enoug h the opening surge became a gamelong surge Warning about the opposing team s opening surge has begged the question Why shouldnt Texas be more concerne d about creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense So far the Longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing teams opening surge before settling down Q Whos fault is it for the drops on short passes from Chris Simms Is it Simms fault for throwing too hard or the receivers for not being able to catch a ball with zip Lawrence Martin BROWN Simms said he is going to start taking something off of those passes He said he doesnt even think about it He said he just throws it not realizing that some of the those short dump passes are being thrown wi th the velocity of a Roger Clemens fastball Simms said he then walks over to the sidelines and hears people saying Can you throw it any harder So lo ok for Simms to tone down the heat on some of those short passes His deep passes however were phenomenal against Kansas Just the right zip Q How long has the TexasTexas Agame not been played on Thanksgivi ng Pete Barnes BROWN UT and Ahave not met on Thanksgiving for seven straight yea rs including this one The UTAgame has been hosted times on Thanksgi ving Day The last four have been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving Texas is in nonThanksgiving Day contests vs AM The last time th e two teams met on Turkey Day was Q Someone was telling me that Texas holds the record for players taken in the NFL draft is that right Randall BROWN Yes Texas has had a player drafted in an NFLrecord straigh t NFL drafts If you

covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the Agame recruits and commitments Chris Simms and more Inside UT Football appears on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot There is so much information being pumped out this week surrounding the TexasTexas Agame here is some of what both schools are releasing to t he media in effort to bolster their teams image Texas Ais taking bragging rights over the s after a rec ord for the decade The Aggies won nine or more games eight times and or more games five times in the s They are touting their victories in the s as more than any Texas school in any single decade The former record for wins in a decade was by Darrell Royal and Fred Akers Texas teams in the s Heres the list being promoted by the Aggies Texas AM s Texas s Texas s Texas Christian s Houston s Texas fans on the other hand can probably take comfort in the only statistic that matters concerning the Aggies UT leads the overall series Longhorn Q A Q What is the latest on the Texas QB situation Ted Manges BROWN Chris Simms will start Friday He took nearly all the snaps for the first five practices during which UT worked on the Agame plan Major Applewhites right knee appears to be responding pretty well He practiced Tuesday for the first time since getting injured at Texas Tech Mack Brown said if Applewhite is healthy enough to back up Simms he would use Applewhite on a needtowinthegame basis Those situations would seem to include Simms getting hurt or Simms being completely ineffective Otherwise look for Simms to play most or all of Fridays game IMAGE Kenny Hayter Q Next year when Hodges Mitchell is gone will Texas play Kenny Hayter or freshman Cedric Benson Why Cotton Davis BROWN I think its too early to tell If Benson is as good as adverti sed I think hell have a good chance of playing early because Kenny Hayter Iva n Williams and Victor Ike did not overwhelm the coaches this season But Snee zy Beltran will be coming off of a redshirt season too And hell probably ha ve a say in how much playing time anyone gets Q Can you give us an update on injuries BROWN TE Brock Edwards leg DT Stevie Lee foot and WR Artie Ellis shin are out SS Lee Jackson hamstring and QB Major Applewhite knee a re questionable For AM LB Jason Glenn knee the Aggies leader in sacks i s out WR Robert Ferguson ankle and CB Sammy Davis ankle both did not practice Tuesday for the Aggies and were listed as questionable Q I sent you a question last week about the intensity and hate that the Horns didnt have for the OU game and was wondering if Coach Brown a thin ks he made a mistake by having the players take the OU game so lightly with comments like we dont hate OU and its just another game on t he schedule and b is that the attitude that will prevail going into the Agame and in future OU games Joe Rushing BROWN Mack Brown and his staff are not an inyourface group of coach es Players say that they are treated with respect Make no mistake they know their jobs are on the line every day in practice They know if they dont perform in practice they will be replaced But SS Greg Brown said that Mac k Brown has never given a hell hath no fury locker room talk before durin g or after a game Greg Brown said that Mack simply states whats on the line for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate themselves Mack has said that as well He said he asks players what works for them best whether it be the toughlove approach or the straightforward approach He has said constant yelling wears off So he doesnt play head games with his team According to coaches and players from his time as OU offensive coordinator back in Mack used to be a much more inyourfac e kind of coach yelling at players to get them going Coach Barry Switzer ha d to tone him down Brown said he has learned that you cant be negative with players that you have to treat them with respect I dont know that you wi ll hear him talk about hating other teams Q Looking at the haul of recruits Texas already has commitments from is there an area of need not being addressed It appears that this is quite a haul of offensive linemen so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the makin g If he signs what will Quan Cosby be asked to do Doesnt he have a twin brother and is that a factor on where he signs When all is said and done where do you think this class will rank come signing day in February and which of the potential signees not orally committed will most determine where that rank ends up Also with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt ye ar and from what I am reading an impressive one at that what do you see in t he future for Cedric Benson What about the returning RBs such as Ivan William s Kenny Hayter et al Is the abundance of talent at RB a good thing or too much of a good thing And one last thing Is anyone looking to transfer aft er the season Roy Cassas BROWN Quarterbacks and linemen on both sides of the ball control th e game so you can never have enough of those positions UT is filling its needs nicely with the commitments that it has The player that can probably make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison perhaps th e best defensive tackle in the country UTs class is shaping up as a top nationally again If Harris comes it will climb But as is the case with all of this recruiting hype its just that hype Who knows if Cedric Benson will play next year He has to come down here in the heat of August and prove to the coaches that hes better than Kenny Hayter Ivan Williams Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran I would say Bensons chances are good if som e of those guys dont toughen up and let loose But time will tell As far as guys looking to transfer there arent any rumblings yet Stay tuned IMAGE UTs road uniforms Q I can say this because I am a graduate of the University of Texas I think the Longhorn football team has the UGLIEST uniform in all of college football When the Horns play on the road they have too much white and not enough color They wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long sol id white socks are atrocious It looks like each player can dress anyway he desires there is no uniformity in the look Some players dont even wear socks at all It seems the coaches let each player express their own individuality and I think they play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team Coach McWilliams let this trend start and it has continued through the current regime

covers UT football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the bowl picture UTs quarterback situation Chris Simms next years potential stars and more Inside UT Football appea rs on Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot I received several responses to an email from a reader last week regard ing UTs uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them Here are some o f the responses One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their uniforms I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the classiest coolest uniforms in the country I admit to being biased but love the simple nonbusy look of the allwhite uniforms I also have no problem wi th the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested The white helmets with the simple yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as pronounced a s the star on the Dallas Cowboys helmet While I agree with him about the black shoes I think any changes to individualize or otherwise change their look would be a move in the wrong direction Rick Peurifoy I was interested in John Pharrs comments about the UT uniforms Having been at UT in the s I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go I certainly think the best uniforms were in the season perhaps influenc ed by a national championship These were burnt orange jerseys sans individual name on back and TEXAS on the front with the plain white pan ts and orange stockings The white uniform still had the orange stockings but the jersey was white You may remember that Fred Akers brought the candystriped pants ala OU and added the TEXAS to the jersey Personally I like the jersey but think the return of the orange stockings would add something to both uniforms but particularly the road white One amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the uniforms his response was that these are work clothes and not intended t o be fancy I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac k a long way I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the Longhorn in the early s but it didnt add much Keep up the good work I always enjoy your newsletter Tom Thornell Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms I think they are amo ng the sharpest anywhere If we change the helmets then we look like a high school team What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are orange and white Period So what if it doesnt have too much color I hope we stay exactly the same Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an d added orange pants They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field Russell Phillips Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us a look at the bowl picture Sandy Martin BROWN Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday a nd will face either Oregon State or Oregon It will be Oregon State if the Beavers dont get a BCS berth It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BC S berth If OU beats Kansas State look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton Bowl Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl Iowa State would go to the Insightcom Bowl Texas Awould go to the Independence Bowl in Shrevepor t and play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State and Texas Tech wou ld go to the galleryfurniturecom Bowl IMAGE Chris Simms Q Im very happy for Chris Simms but what should we expect from him no w It seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt although one could argue that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year Stil l since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank ed after five passes a redshirt seems like a reach If he doesnt redshirt what is the best guess for Texas QB in I know that you get asked this ever y week but with the new development following the Agame it seems that w e are starting fresh in this story Kyle Moore BROWN Simms bigtime performance against Aadds all kinds of new wrinkles to the landscape for My best guess is Simms will get the start for th e bowl game and well be back in the same situation we were heading into this season Major Applewhites knee injury this time to his right knee again gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms not only now but heading into t he spring and next fall Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldnt rule out a rotation again But one would have to think after the sluggish start the offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be reluctant to do that again Despite breaking nearly every passing record at Texas Applewhite didnt look as sharp as he has in the past during his las t outings before getting injured Simms would seem to have everything going h is way The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie r this season Now that theyve seen it you would have to think that they wa nt to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw o years not stick with a guy who only has one season left Im not saying thats fair But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would think But we wont know how the QB situation for will shake out until next fall most likely Q Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning UT cou ld have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full Do y ou think BJ Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on Did they just blossom during the Agame Otherwise why havent they see n the field more AB BROWN Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season bu t you could certainly argue that UT should use more threereceiver sets next year with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha ve back at those positions There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t he fullback position was pretty average this season So the coaches will take a strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB At and he has the size He is also quick with good hands If Matthews doesnt add significant oomph to the FB position it could be argued that UT should try to use more oneback sets and get its WR talent on the field But well see UT coaches did a nice job of adjusting this season to a twoback tworeceiver set aft er they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers with too many formations and too many quarterbacks Now that the receivers can probably handle more of the playbook look for UT to be as multiple and complex an offense as possible next season BJ Johnson finished the year as the team s secondleading receiver so he saw the field plenty Sloan Thomas was the o ne who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions and be ready to fill in at any of them So he was slowed by the learning process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and Brandon Healy Healy is a senior so hell be gone next year Flowers shoul d be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking Q Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are either redshirting or transferred Bart Fields BROWN Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer Kyle Shanahan the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan Simms said both will really help the team a lot next year Jeffery is and trying t o bulk up from pounds Shanahan is and trying to bulk up from pounds But both have shown great hands in practice The first two names th at jumped off of Mack Browns lips when asked about players to watch in bowl practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas With Texas losing four linebackers after next season DeAnd re Lewis Everick Rawls Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones Brown said some new faces will have to play a bunch in to be ready to become starters at linebacker in two years Q Im a little concerned about our running backs Next years crop loo ks mighty inexperienced We never seemed to be able to run up the middle consistently this year Who would you figure has the best shot at being an inside bruiser What role will our fullbacks play Russell Phillips BROWN Its the biggest question mark on an offense that should be absolutely loaded next season I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis and Cory Quye but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov er at tackle nicely Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar r has lost about pounds from to and looks good So with a line that should continue to improve the Longhorns just need a back who can run behind it Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility Coaches want Victor Ike Ken ny Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up Coaches have told those three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce consistently IMAGE Sloan Thomas Q With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has is there enough room at wideo ut for Artie Ellis next season Frank Seles BROWN Dont be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season At and more than pounds he is a bit undersized but could add the weight His speed would give Texas the surehanded deepthreat tight end they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife It may be a longshot but don t be surprised Q While watching the AMUT game I noticed that UT received the ball at the opening kickoff and the secondhalf kickoff And UT got the wind at its back in the th quarter How did this happen and if Awon the toss why would the Aggies choose to defer give UT the ball at both kickoffs and go into the wind in the nd and th quarters Ryan M Austin BROWN Texas Awon the toss at the beginning of the game and chose the wind at its back giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter The Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter and took the ball into the wind Q Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team co ach UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams This year the Longhorns would have been and possibly on their way to a BCS game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown against Stanford With money apparently not being a factor I really do not understand why Brown doesnt break down and hire some specialized help Don Stevenson Huntington Texas BROWN I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan which is to divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches IMAGE DeAndre Lewis making the tackle Q Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is f or a winning team Weve had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer a nd James Brown whose onfield performances may have been surpassed by their offfield contributions I think were losing a lot of leadership this year when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave Of the returning players who does it look like will step up as team leaders next year Keith Heugatter BROWN On defense Mack Brown said hell look for Cory Redding and De Andre Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers and Greg Brown On offense UT will look to its quarterback its young receiver s and linemen such as Antwan KirkHughes of Waxahachie for leadership Q What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season Steve Beauchamp BROWN The obvious ones are Casey Hampton Shaun Rogers Greg Brown H odges Mitchell and Leonard Davis But the one that may be missed the most is Kris Stockton He kicked several gamewinning field goals two years ago and has done nothing but continue to break records since He has been an afterthoug ht because he has been so automatic on field goals He has also done an excellent job of punting this season Matt McFadden a redshirt freshman will handle the kicking duties next year And at punter redshirt freshman Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed to the Longhorns for next year That will be a huge question mark for Texas to answer next season Q Who do you pick in the Kansas StateOU game Seems like OU is missin g its October magic Id have to take OU in a close one Heupel isnt grea t but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offens e in the pros Andrew Bowen BROWN I too think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue its Shock the World season Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman The vote s are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum Q Can you give us an update on the mens and womens basketball teams Lucius Thornton BROWN The mens team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victor ies over Navy California and Indiana any of which could help the Longhorns down the road at tournament time The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT but coach Rick Barnes was able to prove a point to his team about being intimidated As of Tuesday nights game with UTSan Antonio Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup point guard Royal Ivey small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thoma s Duncanvilles Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward Chri s Owens has been a shotblocking force and transfer Maurice Evans is the teams leading scorer and is starting to hit a better percentage from the floor The mens team doesnt have another test until Dec when the team plays at South Florida Other games worth watching or getting tickets for include home games against Illinois Dec and Utah Dec The women s team has also gotten off to a nice start with its only earlyseason loss coming against Purdue The womens team is relying on several newcomers including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings The team i s also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard So both teams are young with a lot of upside If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri be sign up at Newsletter

Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot There is so much information being pumped out this week surrounding the TexasTexas Agame here is some of what both schools are releasing to t he media in effort to bolster their teams image Texas Ais taking bragging rights over the s after a rec ord for the decade The Aggies won nine or more games eight times and or more games five times in the s They are touting their victories in the s as more than any Texas school in any single decade The former record for wins in a decade was by Darrell Royal and Fred Akers Texas teams in the s Heres the list being promoted by the Aggies Texas AM s Texas s Texas s Texas Christian s Houston s Texas fans on the other hand can probably take comfort in the only statistic that matters concerning the Aggies UT leads the overall series Longhorn Q A Q What is the latest on the Texas QB situation Ted Manges BROWN Chris Simms will start Friday He took nearly all the snaps for the first five practices during which UT worked on the Agame plan Major Applewhites right knee appears to be responding pretty well He practiced Tuesday for the first time since getting injured at Texas Tech Mack Brown said if Applewhite is healthy enough to back up Simms he would use Applewhite on a needtowinthegame basis Those situations would seem to include Simms getting hurt or Simms being completely ineffective Otherwise look for Simms to play most or all of Fridays game IMAGE Kenny Hayter Q Next year when Hodges Mitchell is gone will Texas play Kenny Hayter or freshman Cedric Benson Why Cotton Davis BROWN I think its too early to tell If Benson is as good as adverti sed I think hell have a good chance of playing early because Kenny Hayter Iva n Williams and Victor Ike did not overwhelm the coaches this season But Snee zy Beltran will be coming off of a redshirt season too And hell probably ha ve a say in how much playing time anyone gets Q Can you give us an update on injuries BROWN TE Brock Edwards leg DT Stevie Lee foot and WR Artie Ellis shin are out SS Lee Jackson hamstring and QB Major Applewhite knee a re questionable For AM LB Jason Glenn knee the Aggies leader in sacks i s out WR Robert Ferguson ankle and CB Sammy Davis ankle both did not practice Tuesday for the Aggies and were listed as questionable Q I sent you a question last week about the intensity and hate that the Horns didnt have for the OU game and was wondering if Coach Brown a thin ks he made a mistake by having the players take the OU game so lightly with comments like we dont hate OU and its just another game on t he schedule and b is that the attitude that will prevail going into the Agame and in future OU games Joe Rushing BROWN Mack Brown and his staff are not an inyourface group of coach es Players say that they are treated with respect Make no mistake they know their jobs are on the line every day in practice They know if they dont perform in practice they will be replaced But SS Greg Brown said that Mac k Brown has never given a hell hath no fury locker room talk before durin g or after a game Greg Brown said that Mack simply states whats on the line for each game and expects the players to find their own way to motivate themselves Mack has said that as well He said he asks players what works for them best whether it be the toughlove approach or the straightforward approach He has said constant yelling wears off So he doesnt play head games with his team According to coaches and players from his time as OU offensive coordinator back in Mack used to be a much more inyourfac e kind of coach yelling at players to get them going Coach Barry Switzer ha d to tone him down Brown said he has learned that you cant be negative with players that you have to treat them with respect I dont know that you wi ll hear him talk about hating other teams Q Looking at the haul of recruits Texas already has commitments from is there an area of need not being addressed It appears that this is quite a haul of offensive linemen so it looks like a lot of redshirts in the makin g If he signs what will Quan Cosby be asked to do Doesnt he have a twin brother and is that a factor on where he signs When all is said and done where do you think this class will rank come signing day in February and which of the potential signees not orally committed will most determine where that rank ends up Also with Sneezy Beltran coming off a redshirt ye ar and from what I am reading an impressive one at that what do you see in t he future for Cedric Benson What about the returning RBs such as Ivan William s Kenny Hayter et al Is the abundance of talent at RB a good thing or too much of a good thing And one last thing Is anyone looking to transfer aft er the season Roy Cassas BROWN Quarterbacks and linemen on both sides of the ball control th e game so you can never have enough of those positions UT is filling its needs nicely with the commitments that it has The player that can probably make the biggest difference is Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison perhaps th e best defensive tackle in the country UTs class is shaping up as a top nationally again If Harris comes it will climb But as is the case with all of this recruiting hype its just that hype Who knows if Cedric Benson will play next year He has to come down here in the heat of August and prove to the coaches that hes better than Kenny Hayter Ivan Williams Victor Ike and Sneezy Beltran I would say Bensons chances are good if som e of those guys dont toughen up and let loose But time will tell As far as guys looking to transfer there arent any rumblings yet Stay tuned IMAGE UTs road uniforms Q I can say this because I am a graduate of the University of Texas I think the Longhorn football team has the UGLIEST uniform in all of college football When the Horns play on the road they have too much white and not enough color They wear the ugliest black football shoes and those long sol id white socks are atrocious It looks like each player can dress anyway he desires there is no uniformity in the look Some players dont even wear socks at all It seems the coaches let each player express their own individuality and I think they play like a bunch of individuals instead of as a team Coach McWilliams let this trend start and it has continued through the current regime

comment than a question But everyo ne is entitled to their own opinion I dont know about the burnt orange helmets That might be a little too much of a good thing Q Do you think that the loss to OU will hurt our recruiting class I k now that we tend to compete for the same players and that they had their recrui ts at the Cotton Bowl since they were the home team T Franks Austin BROWN It appears that Oklahoma is making some serious inroads on UT recruiting territory at least for the or so recruits the Longhorns stil l hope to get orally committed Namely Tommie Harris the defensive tackle o ut

Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Chip Shot Thirteen senior Longhorns will be playing their final home game when Tex as meets Texas Aon Friday Nov They will be honored in a pregame ceremony Among the seniors playing their final home game are six current starters Free safety Greg Brown of Baton Rouge La offensive tackle Leonard Da vis of Wortham defensive tackle Casey Hampton of Galveston Ball running back Hodges Mitchell of Skyline defensive tackle Shaun Rogers of LaPorte and placekicker Kris Stockton of Katy Five other seniors who have seen significant playing time are Wide receiver Brandon Healy of Carlsbad Calif punter Ryan Long of Richardson Pearce offensive tackle Cory Quye of San Antonio Marshall wide receiver Jamel Thompson of Skyline and safety Joe Walker of Galena Park North Shore Other seniors playing their final game are Linebacker Scott Emley of San Antonio Churchill and defensive back Marc us Walther of Hillcrest Longhorn Q A Q Can you give us the history behind the Hex Rally And also when is it this year Margot Linney BROWN According to the Texas sports information office the Hex Rally will be held Monday Nov at pm on the universitys main mall in front o f the UT Tower For years the TexasTexas A game featured bonfires at bo th schools But the environmentalists won out in Austin causing the end to th e bonfire for UT students In place of the traditional bonfire Texas turned instead to an old story to start a new tradition In Texas had not beaten Texas Aat Kyle Field since A group of students turned to a n Austin fortune teller named Mrs August Hipple who gave them the prescription for victory Burn red candles she said The burning of the candles she thought would show the great support for the team Texas won and the red candle legend was born The candle burning lay dormant until when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU game and the Longhorns upset No SMU It was back in the boxes fo r the candles after that until when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was unbeaten and seeking its firstever SWC title Texas blocked an extra point after the first score and won The red candles are the most potent whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked wrote Tim e magazine after the upset In Texas was driving for its first unbeaten season in modern history and the possibility of a national championship as it hosted Baylor For three of the previous four years UT had been in the same position on the verge of a perfect year only to be upset Out came the red candles one more time and UT won Bonfires ended in Austin in the late s and seeking a new tradition the hex rallies were started in IMAGE Chris Simms Q So far this season Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that we re returned for touchdowns if you count the return on the failed twopoint conversion attempt last week in Kansas Can you help explain what Chris is doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem Also has Chris set a school record in this statistic I enjoy the newsletter Jeff Cookston BROWN Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking onto his intended receiver too early in his drop back He will look away from hi s intended receiver but only for a split second He needs to look off the defense better an d he also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage He suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre He sees a receiver in double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and returned for a TD against Kansas He said he should have thrown it away He said hes learning He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas is at an alltime high So thats good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up getting the start against Texas AM Q I have heard that next years schedule is just about as weak as this years Can you either give it to us or let us know where on the Web to fi nd it Steve Davis BROWN The schedule is as follows Sept New Mexico State Sep t North Carolina Sept at Houston Sept Texas Tech Oct Oklahom a in Dallas Oct at Oklahoma State Oct Colorado Oct at Missouri Nov at Baylor Nov Kansas and Nov or at Texas AM Q Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle To his credit he maintained that two QBs were better than one At this stage and based on Chris Simms recent games it would seem to me that Brown was correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five games in a row Also Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simm s motivated What do you think Charley Davis Southlake Texas BROWN I think the rotation is now paying off But I still stand by my belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in t he year Mack Brown said the rotation didnt work as well as it could have because this years team lacked senior leadership At North Carolina Brown said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older Anyway theres no doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year A nd Simms is definitely still happy at Texas No chance of him transferring Q Can you update us on UTs injuries Ken BROWN As of right now Major Applewhites right knee sprain is keepin g him out of practice this week and he is questionable for the Agame SS Lee Jackson hamstring is probable TE Brock Edwards leg and WR Artie Ellis shin are questionable DT Stevie Lee foot is out and will seek a medica l redshirt for this season a move that would give him four years of eligibility remaining IMAGE Cedric Benson in white uniform Q Id like an update on recruiting our

Roman Reeves Livingston OL Terrance Young Longview QB Matt Nordgren Dallas Bishop Lynch RB Cedric Benson Midland Lee Anthony Johnson Jefferson DE Eric Hal l Clarksville Tenn LB Yamil LeBron Kille en Ellison LB Lance McFarland Jefferson DB Cedric Griffin San Antonio Holmes DB Aaron Ross Tyler DB Kendal Briles Wolfforth Frenship DB Braden Johnson Euless Trinity DB Brian Carter The Woodlands P Brian Bradford Trinity Valley JC Q Which bowl do you see UT ending up in I know that the secondplace team in the Big goes to the Cotton Bowl What place would Texas be if we defeated AM I remember that when Abeat Kansas State a few years ago KState ended up in the Alamo Bowl and UT played in the Cotton Bowl Is the re a chance of a repeat of that if OU beats KState in the Big championship game Mike Thakur BROWN If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big title game there s a chance both teams will get into the BCS Nebraska would then be the likely choice for the Cotton Bowl and the TexasTexas Awinner would be the li kely choice for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl But there are rumblings that Nebraska isnt excited about the Cotton Bowl and would rather go to the Holiday Bowl That could send the UTAwinner to the Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insightcom Bowl in Phoenix Ariz If Oklahoma beats Kansas State the Wildcats would have thre e losses including one to Texas AM That means the Wildcats would probably drop to the Insightcom Bowl And the winner of the UTAgame would go t o either the Holiday or the Cotton with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl T he Holiday opponent would be either Oregon or Oregon State The Alamo opponent would likely be Michigan or Ohio State Q Dont you think Texas has a huge advantage over my Fighting Texas Ag gies for the following reasons UTs playing at home Jason Glenn Robert Ferguson and Sammy Davis three of the Aggies best players are going to be out for the game and AMs coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma i n the biggest game of the year on a national stage It will be hard to recove r from that It looks as if Texas has everything going for it I believe if Awould have beaten Oklahoma there is not any way Texas beats Awhen the Big south crown is on the line Justin S Schwertner BROWN I dont see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahom a loss They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence fro m that game The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss or diminished ability of Glenn Ferguson and Davis Glenn the teams sack leader and a spirited leader at linebacker is out for sure with a knee injury that will require surgery If Ferguson one of the top receivers in the Big and Davis a top cornerback for the Aggies indeed cannot play those are big hurdles to overcome for AM Playing in Austin helps Texas But this game will probably come down to who runs the ball best Look for this to be a showdown between JaMar Toombs and Hodges Mitchell IMAGE Roy Williams Q I thought Roy Williams was good before the Kansas game but he looked like he might have played himself into some postseason awards against the Jayhawks Steve Jansen BROWN Williams caught four passes for yards all in the first ha lf Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half He did have a yard reverse for a touchdown in the second half for his first rushing TD as a Longhorn But perhaps the most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD receptions this season have averaged yards Five of those TD catches came when Texas was behind or tied The other two came when UT was holding narrow threepoint and sevenpoint leads and provided oomph on the way to victories He may end up on some AllBig second teams because Kansas States Quincy Morgan and AMs Robert Ferguson have been pretty good this season Williams will certainly land on any allnewcomer teams however Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division IA in receiving yards TD catches and yards per catch He ranks second nationally among true freshmen in receptions per game Q I hate to complain about anything after such a good win but whats the story behind our soft defense on opening drives It seems that it takes a series or two for us to settle in Is every team we play coming out in some strange offense that we havent seen on film or something After the first drive adjustments we generally shut everyone down with a couple of obvious exceptions Why cant we andout other teams like they do us on opening drives Cody Anderson Houston BROWN Mack Brown has talked all season about how he tells his team to be prepared for an opposing teams opening surge He said he warned his team about a possible opening surge by Oklahoma before that game and sure enoug h the opening surge became a gamelong surge Warning about the opposing team s opening surge has begged the question Why shouldnt Texas be more concerne d about creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense So far the Longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing teams opening surge before settling down Q Whos fault is it for the drops on short passes from Chris Simms Is it Simms fault for throwing too hard or the receivers for not being able to catch a ball with zip Lawrence Martin BROWN Simms said he is going to start taking something off of those passes He said he doesnt even think about it He said he just throws it not realizing that some of the those short dump passes are being thrown wi th the velocity of a Roger Clemens fastball Simms said he then walks over to the sidelines and hears people saying Can you throw it any harder So lo ok for Simms to tone down the heat on some of those short passes His deep passes however were phenomenal against Kansas Just the right zip Q How long has the TexasTexas Agame not been played on Thanksgivi ng Pete Barnes BROWN UT and Ahave not met on Thanksgiving for seven straight yea rs including this one The UTAgame has been hosted times on Thanksgi ving Day The last four have been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving Texas is in nonThanksgiving Day contests vs AM The last time th e two teams met on Turkey Day was Q Someone was telling me that Texas holds the record for players taken in the NFL draft is that right Randall BROWN Yes Texas has had a player drafted in an NFLrecord straigh t NFL drafts If you

covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News answers your questions about the Holiday Bowl UTs quarterback situation probable NFL draft picks Mack Brown and more Inside UT Football appears o n Thursdays Email questions to Chip Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on DallasNewscoms Colleges site Buy all your UT team gear at our EFanshopcom Chip Shot One of the most intriguing matchups to watch in this years Culligan Hol iday Bowl at San Diego will take place on the sidelines with Texas coach Mack Brown going up against Oregons Mike Bellotti You may not know much about Bellotti but know this about his tenure at Oregon in six years he has a record and those wins are more th an any other Pac school during that time period And over the last four seasons Oregon is with four consecutive bowl game appearances The Ducks two losses this season were by a combined total of points vs Wisconsin and at Oregon State Brown certainly is impressed by Bellottis success at Oregon Mike Bellotti is a personal friend Brown said in a news release from UTs sports information office He took over for Rich Brooks at Oregon a number of years ago when they were representing the Pac in the Rose Bowl for th e first time in a long time He has done a great job building on that success each of his years as head coach It will be fun to be around him and his te am throughout the week Added Holiday Bowl president Jim Philion Coach Bellotti has built the Ducks into one of the premiere football programs in the country The game this Dec against Texas will increase an already exciting rivalry betwee n the Pac and the Big Longhorn fans can purchase tickets to the Culligan Holiday Bowl by contacting the UT ticket office BEVO or by logging on to the athletics department Web site wwwTexasSportscom Longhorn Q A Q Longhorn officials will probably not say which bowl they would prefer to play in but were any of their options less desirable becau se of dates travel ticket sales or impressing recruits Todd Davis BROWN The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl I know that sounds like Well of course thats what they would say But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the Kansas game by saying if UT won out they would go to the Holiday Bowl a fun sunny destination against a top team Aside from the beach balls an d surfing the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game For instance Chris Simms was paid by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to the Cotton Bowl last year So hell really clean up this year Not that he needs it But you get the picture Its a way for some of the players to ma ke a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket an d pocket the rest The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on their own The team will not charter a flight All players have to be checked into the team hotel in San Diego by pm on Dec Mack Brown wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would w in the Big South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top team And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team Last year Texas and its fans couldnt seem to get fired up for an unranked Arkansas team in the Cotton Bowl one year after having played in the same game So believe it when UT says the Holiday Bowl is where it wanted t o be IMAGE Casey Hampton Q How high do you think Casey Hampton will go in the NFL draft I woul d think hes a cinch first rounder Could he go in the top five BROWN Hampton could go in the first or second round The second round might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive linemen coming out this year But Hampton has been really watching his weig ht and trying to improve his speed He promised me that scouts at the NFL combine will be surprised when they see him work out Hampton is a great story The guy just works his tail off and knows that his height slightly more than will probably play against him So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNewsco m ran before the Texas Agame The film dont lie If you can show me whe re my height has hurt me its on you I would be surprised if Hampton fell to t he third round Q Lets see now Rose Bowl Cotton Bowl Sugar Bowl Orange B owl Fiesta Bowl Galleryfurniturecom Bowl Which one does NOT give you cold chills just to think about RR BROWN At least the galleryfurniturecom Bowl is not called the Poulan Weedeater Bowl a name that still haunts the nowSanford Independence Bowl where Texas Awill meet up with former coach Jackie Sherrill this year We have to hope the furniture bowl which will be played in the Houston Astrodome fairs better than the old Bluebonnet Bowl which went bankrupt a nd failed to pay Texas and Pittsburgh their purses for the game won by U T That was the last bowl game ever played in Houston Q Texas quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thi ng manufactured by the illfated rotation scheme Now however the quarterba ck controversy is real Texas now has two genuine starting quarterbacks Chri s Simms is no longer the next boy wonder He has arrived Does ANYONE in the nation have a better quarterback tandem than Texas How in the world is Ma ck Brown going to deal with this If they keep the simplified offensive schem e next year do you think the QB rotation could resurface and actually work Rowell Rogers Denton Texas BROWN I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penn y of his salary because of the quarterback situation And hell earn every penny again next year Unless unforseen circumstances such as injuries dictate otherwise I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next year And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms next year He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite just as Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton If Simms starts t he bowl game and Texas plays well and wins Simms will have done nothing to lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to com e in and relieve him then we are back to square one with both guys battling it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter Texas coaches have said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this season because of his experience So well see if their stance has changed Q The yard pumpandgo TD play from Chris Simms to BJ Johnson is both a validation of Simms abilities AND an indictment of the quarterback rotation Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played every offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the defensive player responsible To my mind that is a strong argument agains t any kind of QB rotation scheme But on the other hand how can one NOT wa nt to play both of these immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible Can we get a rule change to allow two footballs on the field at once ha ha BROWN The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rota tion next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flouris h whenever he is on the field But his comments all season have directly and indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence didnt come around until he was taking all the snaps So I dont know if th e coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his confidence IMAGE Mack Brown Q What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach I noticed earl ier in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Browns ability to fire up the tea m assuming that Texas has more talented players I think that he has proven that he can win big games but he has also had some surprising slipups Bro wn is unquestionably a great recruiter but do you question his leadership ability on gameday Andrew Wootton BROWN Up until the Texas Tech game Mack Brown was saying things like We could lose any game we play I just dont know which team is going to show up We could go or Those kinds of comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the Longhorns Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any coach Ive been around So when he was saying things like that it made you wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity Clearly this ye ar was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense The defens e was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge But the offense really struggled to find an identity Part of that was the quarterback rotation Part of it was having young receivers and part of it was having a bunch of guys with lowkey personalities ie Hodges Mitchell Leonard Davis Antwa n KirkHughes Derrick Dockery Mike Williams etc Mack Brown even said it was the quietest bunch of offensive players hed been around Once Mack Bro wn and Co decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as t he starter Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as anything else I think Mack Brown is a great coach Let me say that again He is a grea t coach I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadershi p on the field The more he rotated the QBs the less chance the offense had to develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling wit h learning their responsibilities in fourwide as well as trying to adjust to having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle The offensive linemen earl y on also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of hi m Im sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly than it did Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he played Simms more in the Stanford game an outing in which Applewhite real ly struggled until the fourth quarter Against Oklahoma the Sooners executed flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldnt get up from It was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoo n in Austin according to many But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eati ng out of his hand any time he wants All he has to do is tune out the negativ e comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say We are doing the best we can We learn We make mistakes Were going to keep trying harder Those are comments no negative fan can argue with Instead Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint everything about this season Each press conference was filled with a comme nt about how the media and fans had beat up this years team It was contentious Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times Paterno hates the media rarely gives out interviews etc So if Mack Brown is following in Paternos footsteps on that issue it would be a shame Paterno doesnt have onequillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brow n Brown got tough questions during his radio callin show this season Som e weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others But a guy like Brown is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off of his back use that selfdeprecating laugh of his and then take his frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn hi s team into a juggernaut Mack Brown should know his teams personality going into next year because so many players will be back And hell have this ye ar as a blueprint of how not to do things in many instances And hes where h e wants to be at a major college football power and always being in the position of favorite At North Carolina as well as he recruited and coache d Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood At Texa s he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big Now Oklahoma has come charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without excuses If you notice Stoops didnt gripe about having to play the Big title game and possibly ruin his teams national title chances He didnt gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in Kansas City He has a tough attitude and his team has adopted his attitude Brown has a tough attitude too And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and all of next season will be the truest test of Browns coaching and dealing with expectations Brown said fairly and accurately that Texas couldnt b e expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadnt finished a season in the top since How do you jump to No witho ut having first been in the top Brown said before the season Does this kind of talk trickle into the ears of players I dont know Most of the Longhorns before the season Applewhite and Hampton included felt like Tex as could win the national title Thats one of the biggest reasons Hampton cam e back to Texas this season When UT lost to Stanford Brown emerged from an emotionally blasted locker room and said I didnt think this was a nation al title team He went on to say the team was too young Are these excuses fo r his team If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl the Longhorns will hav e their top finish and will once again be ranked in the top heading int o next season On defense the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Ca sey Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on But Marcus Tubbs Adam Doiron a nd Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better and there is a wealth of talent in the seven guys behind them On offense the big question mark is at running back where Hodges Mitchell is moving on Hes a guy some Texas fan s still think is worthless But let me tell you he isnt Hes got guts and gave everything he had It may take some time to see another back who can catch and run the way he does UT will have several backs to pick from including freshmantobe Cedric Benson The rest of the team is proven and will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end I dont see any excuses for this team next year National championship t alk will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda Heres hoping that Mac k Brown doesnt let the nitpickers bog him down And I include myself in that group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the fact s positive or negative Heres to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possibl e negative angles in a newspaper story Heres to hoping that hell take on critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily basis Places like Texas Alabama and Ohio State have fans who are seemingl y never satisfied Until Brown wins a national championship UT fans will secondguess and doubt and wonder why something else wasnt tried That cou ld continue even if he wins a national title But thats sports Its worse no w because there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the Internet and allday talk radio Mack Brown lives under a microscope Fans think the y are as smart as coaches because they manage a fantasy football team Brown just has to shrug off the naysayers and focus on the reasons he loves coaching Q Among UTs current commitments who do you see as the freshmen most likely to see significant playing time next year BROWN The more I see and hear about Midland Lee running back Cedric Benson the more I think he has the best chance to have an impact next year He appears to have the kind of vision that makes running backs special Q Only two teams had a strength of schedule rating above in the BC S rankings and all the top five teams had a sub rating Given that UT has a decent chance in the national championship race next year what if anythi ng can UT do to help raise its strength of schedule rating Seems like the Longhorns could go undefeated and still be on the outside looking in Andrew Bowen BROWN Well gauging by how some of the BCS polls had Florida State hi gher than Oklahoma I think its fair to say that strength of schedule is a concern for Texas next year I think Texas has to win all its games next season to make sure that it is not in the position of Miami which beat Florida State but is not in the national championship picture If Texas goe s next season the Longhorns could very well not be in control of their own destiny With their schedule as crazy and inflatedexpectationriddled as this sounds the Longhorns would probably need to win all the games to ensure getting a shot at the national championship next season IMAGE Leonard Davis Q Who will be drafted off this team Any first rounders Will the draft distract the seniors from the bowl game Will any juniors declare early Is the NFL looking at any underclassmen on the team Lance Grand Prairie BROWN The obvious draft picks are OT Leonard Davis DT Casey Hampton and DT Shaun Rogers SS Greg Brown may also get a look from an NFL team after t he year he has had I think Davis is a firstround pick for sure Hampton and Rogers shouldnt fall past the second round although they could simply because there are a number of top defensive lineman in next years NFL draft NFL scouts are intrigued by junior Quenti n Jammer because of his size and physical play at cornerback NFL scouts like junior DeAndre Lewis speed and size at linebacker But UT officials seem confident that no underclassmen will jump from this years team Q Please discuss the coaching staffs approach to bowl games Did we approach the Mississippi State Cotton Bowl with a different philosophy or attitude than the Arkansas Cotton Bowl What is our attitude about Oregon a nd the Holiday Bowl Keith Heugatter BROWN The Cotton Bowl after the season was the final chapter to a storybook season That team was riding the euphoria of Ricky Williams Heisman Trophy and felt like it was on top of the world The team that face d Arkansas in last Januarys Cotton Bowl had lost two straight and then found itself back in Dallas feeling a little unsure about itself against an Arkansas team looking for its first bowl victory since This season Texas is riding a sixgame winning streak finally got the breakout game it was looking for from Chris Simms and really wants to win its bowl game to finish in the top for the first time in years I would be surprised very surprised if Texas comes out flat and doesnt make a good showing in the Holiday Bowl Even though they dont know much about Oregon the Longhorns know the Ducks are ranked higher than they are Thats all they need to know If the players can avoid the trouble they ran into before las t years Cotton Bowl suspensions to two team leaders Aaron Humphrey and Kwa me Cavil as well as JJ Kelly and Jamal Joyner I think Texas will be stron g and focused Q Is Leonard Davis up for any major awards this season Clark Routier BROWN Longhorn OT Leonard Davis is one of three finalists for the Out land Trophy The award will be presented live on Thursday night pm Central on the ESPN College Football Awards Show at Disney World Davis ha s been tabbed a firstteam AllAmerican by The Football Writers Association Walter Camp Football Foundation and Sporting News Q Can you give us an update on the mens basketball team Shirley Lively BROWN The mens team is starting to come together and could get a hug e boost in the next couple of weeks if senior Darren Kelly can regain his eligibility The semester ends Dec but coach Rick Barnes isnt sure wh en hell find out if Kelly has made his grades and regained his academic standing for next semester One thing is for sure Barnes believes the Longhorns will only get better with Kelly in the lineup He said Kelly dominates in practice with his dribble penetration and quickness He said Kelly would help players like junior transfer Maurice Evans Evans by the way has continued to look more comfortable in the Longhorns offense He w as named the Phillips Big Conference Rookie of the Week the league offi ce announced Tuesday The junior transfer earned the award by averaging points per game while hitting of field goals including of threepointers during Texas two victories over UTSan Antonio and Southwest Texas State last week The honor is chosen by a panel of media observers who cover Big mens basketball Evans had a seasonhigh points on of shooting of threes vs UTSan Antonio before posti ng points on of shooting of threes against Southwest Texas The lone Longhorn to reach doublefigure scoring in each of UTs first six contests he leads the team in scoring ppg and ranks third in rebounding rpg and blocks five Texas returns to action when it travels to Tampa Fla to face South Florida on Saturday Dec Tipoff is scheduled for pm Central at the Sun Dome The game will be televised nationally by ESPN Q Can you give us an update on the womens basketball team Dana Gooden BROWN The UT women are and off to their best start since the season They moved into the top No this week and then backed it up by traveling to Illinois and pounding the Fighting Illini The Illin i were ranked No last week UT extends its win streak to six games marki ng the first time since that the Horns have had a sixgame win streak The leaders of this years team are JoRuth Woods of Cedar Hill Tai Dillard of San Antonio freshman Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro sophomore Lindsey Rya n of Austin Westlake and Tracy Cook of Cedar Hill UT is also getting help at point guard from junior college transfer Kenya Larkin of Duncanville Freshman forward Annissa Hastings will also be one to watch UT plays Orego n at home on Saturday and then wont have another test until Tennessee comes to town on Dec If you received this newsletter from a
