Times Wed RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA Individualcom Wed Calif Regulators Raise Power Rates State backs rate hike But increase still may not resolve crisis By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers Published March SAN FRANCISCO Brushing aside the shouts and hisses of outraged protesters state regulators approved a billionayear utility rate hike Tuesday b ut couldnt guarantee that the increases will remedy Californias electricity crisis With activists chanting rate hikes no way and utility executives branding the decision as inadequate the Public Utilities Commission voted to raise rates about percent for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison The rate hike took effect immediately but probably wont show up in customer bills until May But while PUC commissioners said they were taking a bold step major holes remain in the states patchwork effort to save the two beleaguered utilitie s and ensure reliable energy supplies during what promises to be a long hot summer The higher rates wont pay off billions in old utility debts leaving PGE and Edison under the continued threat of a bankruptcy filing by power generators bondholders or other creditors The increases will likely curtail energy consumption but its unlikely the cutbacks will be enough to stave off rolling blackouts this summer The PUC put off a crucial decision on how to allocate the rate hikes across custome r categories and the final rate design could determine how much Californians will conserve The vote may not achieve one of its key goals reviving the wind farms cogenerators and other alternativeenergy producers that provide more than percent of Californias electricity Hundreds have shut down in recent weeks because o f nonpayment by PGE and Edison contributing to rolling blackouts March a nd After months of prodding the PUC approved what may well be the largest utility rate increase in Californias history saying it had no choice if i t was to shore up utility finances and lessen the risk of blackouts It raise d rates just under percent in addition to making permanent a percent surcharge approved in January The increased revenue will go to pay for the state Department of Water Resources power purchases on the utilities behalf and to alternativeenergy producers that supply a major chunk of the utilities power The PUCs move could make utility bankruptcies more palatable to state officials because it ensures payment for future power supplies Now if we have a bankruptcy a lot of bad things will probably happen but theres le ss risk to the general public of mass power disruptions said state Sen Debr a Bowen DMarina del Rey chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee PGE arguing that the PUC didnt go nearly far enough said it will demand the panel reconsider Todays actions while providing a welcome dose of realism in the ene rgy policy debate unfortunately do not resolve any of the key issues facing Californias policymakers PGE President Gordon Smith said Smith said the decision could worsen Californias energy problems by forcin g the utilities to pay the state Department of Water Resources which is buyi ng power on the utilities behalf ahead of other creditors An Edison vice president Bruce Foster said the rate increase is a step i n the right direction but added Only time will tell if its enough The company announced it will start making interest payments on defaulted bond and bank debts Edison and PGE both criticized the commission for sharply lowering the PUC s estimates of the utilities debts PUC commissioners acknowledged they have more work to do to resolve Californias energy mess and some hinted that additional rate hikes may b e in the offing Have we gotten the number right I dont know said Commissioner Henry Duque But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the billion will be enough to pay Californias ongoing power bills Meanwhile Gov Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Davis said Until we do I cannot support any rate increase While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increa se is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis approval three of it s members are Davis appointees and last Friday his aides shared data with business lobbyists indicating rates would rise substantially said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association Consumer advocates blasted rate increases as a surrender to the power generators that control much of Californias electricity Noting that the states grid operator has accused the generators of overcharging Californians by billion they urged the PUC to focus its firepower on those robber barons on steroids as Berkeley activist Barbar a George put it Its like dealing with the mob said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Instead of breaking our fingers theyre goi ng to turn the lights out again Jamming the PUCs auditorium to near capacity activists said the state should seize the generators power plants They razzed the commissioners wi th taunts of blood money and its a sham prompting guards to escort some protesters out PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters saying the generators are the real culprits in our energy crisis But she said the commission had to approve rate hikes The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power generators to refund some of their profits Lynch said the rate hikes would be refunded to customers if generators are forced to surrender money The higher rates will generate billion in additional yearly revenue f or Edison and billion for PGE according to PUC estimates But with most of the money going to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources for current and future power purchases the PUC action doesnt repay the billions the utilities owe to generators and other creditors You still have billion maybe more of costs that havent been paid fo r and thats still a problem said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Tradin g Forum an association of power generators I dont believe creditors are going to be infinitely patient The two utilities have defaulted on billions of debts and face a daily thre at of bankruptcy Thats still an issue that ultimately has to be addressed said Senior Vi ce President John Stout of Reliant Energy Inc a generator thats owed million Davis is negotiating to buy the transmission grid from Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co as a means of paying off the utilities existing debts But Bowen the Energy Committee chair said she doubts the deal will go through Beyond complaining the PUC didnt solve the existingdebt issue the utilities were dismayed by a change in PUC accounting that sharply lowers estimates of their debts and could have major impacts on how much control regulators keep over their operations for months to come Even though rates keep going up a state ordered rate freeze remains technically in effect a nd that freeze gives regulators ammunition to argue that utilities cant pass all their costs on to customers PGEs Smith called it the most egregious commission action Edison calle d it illegal The board voted to raise rates cents a kilowatthour and make permanent a cent increase approved in January Documents from Lynchs office said rat es would rise on average percent but Lynch later described it as percen t The PUC put off a decision on how the higher rates will affect each custome r category other than to say its leaning toward a system that will charge more for electricity consumed above a certain threshold The PUC estimated that percent of residential ratepayers those who use less than that threshold will see no rise at all Lynch proposed some businesses would s ee rate hikes of as much as percent How much conservation will this get us It will depend very much on how it s designed said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute The rate hikes wont affect customers of municipal utilities such as Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD is planning a percent rate hike The PUC vote may do little to help the hundreds of alternativeenergy producers known as qualifying facilities many of which have shut down fo r nonpayment The PUC on Tuesday ordered PGE and Edison to start paying these producers in April but some of the producers say the PUCs new pricing mechanism doesn t get them back on their feet financially Many following the lead of one Imperial Valley producer may choose to sever their contracts with the two utilities and sell their power elsewhere even out of state This is not a solution cogenerators lawyer Jerry Bloom said of the PUC vote It will drive additional plants off the system

prices hit DustTex Service Inc Then skyrocketing natural gas bills socked the Sacramento industrial laundry service Now a third financial blow looms higher electricity bills Its become a real nightmare Its pretty scary You have to find money to pay these bills said Sylvia Compton coowner of the longtime familyowne d south Sacramento business It could be worse for Compton whose business is served by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District It will be for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co who face rate hikes averaging percent in addition to a percent rate increase already approved The California Public Utilities Commission gave PGE and Southern Californi a Edison permission to raise electric rates by billion a year How the burden will fall on various customer groups hasnt been decided Although SMUD customers arent affected by the PUCs decision to sharply raise rates they arent likely to be immune SMUD also facing skyrocketin g energy costs is considering rate increases ranging from percent to percent For DustTex and scores of other California companies any rate hike would be another unwelcome increase in the cost of doing business It will hit at a time the US economy is slowing and employer costs such as health benefits are soaring For consumers it will mean a double blow higher electricity bills at home and higher prices for goods and services Raleys the West Sacramentobased supermarket chain for example uses hug e amounts of electricity not only for lights and refrigeration at its stores but also to cool food at its distribution centers Given the thin profit margins of the grocery business it has little choice but to raise prices We are doing all we can at Raleys to conserve energy But as rates go up we will have to pass those increases on to our customers in the cost of goods said Michael Teel Raleys president and chief executive officer The higher electric bills approved by the PUC aimed at keeping the state s two biggest utilities from bankruptcy mean California businesses and consumers will have almost billion less to spend each year on other things While that amount represents a huge bite out of consumer spending by itsel f it wont necessarily lead to a recession said Brad Williams senior economist at the state Legislative Analysts Office What were really talking about is less economic growth Williams said Some households will feel this and it will pinch their budgets and affect how much income they have for purchasing goods and services The state estimates that spending on electricity last year averaged between and percent of both business production costs and household budgets Some business owners and economists welcomed the boost in electricity rates saying in the long run they will spur energy conservation efforts boost power generating capacity and prevent rolling blackouts and their devastati ng effect on business productivity Its much worse for us if we have these damn blackouts We have employees and if theres a blackout theyre all sitting around twiddling their thumbs and Ive still got to pay them said Norm Rogers president o f ZWorld Inc in Davis which designs and builds miniature specialpurpose computers Many economists and business experts believe rolling blackouts not higher electricity rates are the biggest threat to the economy Its better to have higher rates and secure power than lower rates and blackouts said Stephen Levy senior economist at the Center for Continuin g Study of the California Economy The state can work through the higher powe r costs just as it did when gasoline and diesel prices soared last year Le vy said In reaction to the higher power rates a small number of businesses may lea ve California expand out of state or fail though most will be able to weath er the short run said Robert Smiley dean of the Graduate School of Managemen t at the University of California Davis Most firms will give the state just six to months to solve the energy crisis before theyll start looking elsewhere Smiley said David Molinaro owner of Yolo Ice and Creamery Inc a Woodlandbased ice cream dairy and ice distributor cant pick up and leave He absorbed high er diesel fuel costs for his delivery trucks for six months before levying a surcharge in January Theres just no way his company can eat the higher electricity costs he said Its frustrating People are thinking you are getting rich by raising prices Molinaro said Other businesses may have little choice but to swallow the higher utility costs We compete with global suppliers for almost every product Its virtually impossible for us to pass these costs on said Jeff Boese of the Californi a League of Food Processors If we dont get a handle on energy costs very quickly I would suspect a significant number of food processors to leave th e state In past months the rocketing energy costs have forced companies to take dramatic steps to shave expenses DustTex for example has scrapped pay raises raised prices

may opt to trim or eliminate health benefits for workers Levitt said Bee staff writer Lisa Rapaport contributed to this report Use more energy pay higher rates By Edie Lau Bee Science Writer Published March For all the talk of electricity rates going up across the state theres a way every resident of California can avoid the price hit altogether Just u se electricity sparingly A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesda y does not affect households that use less than percent of a baseline amount of power Fortyfive percent of households already stay within that limit according to PUC President Loretta Lynch The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas and Electrics territory percent utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUCapprov ed increase but is planning to raise rates this spring as well It too proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of kilowatthours used over baseline District rate administrator Alan Wilcox said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back their electricity use How difficult might that be If youre accustomed to using a central air conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat it could be difficult by Wilcoxs reckoning If youre running an airconditioning load in the Valley you could probab ly expect to get into that second tier above baseline a little bit he said There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or have swamp coolers or just go without In SMUD territory the baseline is kilowatthours per month in summer and kwh in winter for most customers Households that do not use gas a nd are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption at least it w as the average when the baseline was set in the early s Consumption has crept up a bit since to kwh a month last year Under SMUDs rateincrease proposal the summertime rate would remain at cents per kilowatthour for the first kwh The price would rise b y cents a kilowatthour for the next kwh used up to kwh Big energy consumers would pay more than cents for each kwh used over kwh Bottom line The biggest users pay the most Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC which will affect PGE customers as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric have yet to be worked out but the rates are expecte d to be structured in a similar tiered fashion Currently PGE customers yeararound pay cents per kilowatthour up t o the baseline limit and cents for every kilowatthour over baseline The average baseline throughout the territory is between and kwh Tabor said it varies from region to region to account for climate Tabor said the PGE baseline amounts to between percent and percent o f the average electricity use per household in a given territory That proportion she said was taken from a Lifeline program in effect from to that was meant to provide a minimum necessary quantity of electrici ty and gas at a lower cost Tabor said percent of PGEs residential customers use only baseline amounts of electricity Bee staff writer Carrie Peyton contributed to this report Regulators prescribe biggest rate increase in state history Davis calls ruling for PGE Edison premature consumer groups push for seizure of plants By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER March SAN FRANCISCO State regulators yesterday approved the biggest rate increase in California history for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electri c and Southern California Edison but Gov Gray Davis said the increase is premature The governor appearing to soften his longstanding opposition said he wou ld support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate increase is necessary for the good of the state The Public Utilities Commission controlled by Davis appointees voted for an immediate rate increase A statement from Davis who usually demands that appointees reflect his policy did not say whether he would ask the PU C or the Legislature for a rollback if he concludes the increase is unneeded Developments in Californias power crisis Congressman eyes nuclear vessels as source of power Bush calls California energy crisis ominous Rate hike means new political heat for California governor He can ask said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary That is one of many options But now we are waiting for the numbers to plug in the data an d see if a rate increase is necessary The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for a rate increase SDGE has a debt of million but has been paying all of its bills unlike PGE and Edison Those companies say they have debt of billion SDGE is in a different situation because its rates were capped by legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt allowing the utility to borrow The bills of SDGE customers soared last summer when the utility became the first to be deregulated Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PGE we would hope they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of cents p er kilowatt hour said Ed Van Herik a SDGE spokesman Consumer groups warned that outofstate generators who have been ordered by FERC to make some rebates for overcharging will make even more money under the rate increase Some are urging Davis to seize California power plants owned by the generators These people are war criminals said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco The PUC meeting which occurred on a day when the state was hit by a Stage alert because of reduced imports from the Northwest was interrupted by shouts from demonstrators who want a stateowned power system They chanted Public power now we wont pay and Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica which is threatening to put a public power initiative on the ballot next year said some attorneys think the abrupt rate increase can be challenged in court Assemblyman Rod Pacheco RRiverside announced that he will introduce legislation to repeal the rate increase He said a decision should be made not by appointees but by elected officials who are accountable to the publi c Democratic legislative leaders who have large majorities in both houses said Monday that they have reluctantly concluded a rate increase is necessary Davis is scheduled to meet with Assembly Democrats this afternoo n The rate increase approved for PGE and Edison yesterday is cents per kilowatt hour The PUC president Loretta Lynch said media reports of the increase amounting to a percent rise are inaccurate Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about percent if applied across the board She bases her figure on the total bill that includes electricity transmission distribution and other costs The medias characterization of the rate increase as percent is based on only the cost of electricity not the total bill The electricity costs before the increase were cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and cen ts for PGE SDGEs rate is cents Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed tha t the state which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in midJanuary will have to spend more than expected A state plan to lower costs through longterm contracts will fall short this summer The state has been spending about billion a month to buy power The PU C also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly bill collected by utilities which will be used to finance a bond of billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected befor e summer when heat drives up the demand for electricity A number of small generators that provide a quarter of the states power are not operating because they have not been paid by utilities The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PGE to begin paying the small generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of natural gas at the Oregon border rather than at the Southern California border with Arizona Prices at the Arizona border have been percent higher David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association which represents small generators said many of the small plants in Southern California will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the Arizona border Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate Fogarty warned Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal qualifying facilities program since November PGE has been paying them only about percent The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the billion they owe to the small generators Jan SmutnyJones of the Independent Energy Producers said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they ca n pay their debts Many of the small generators produce power from renewable sources such as solar wind geothermal and biomass But most of the small generators use natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompt ed by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation Davis aides told reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of Lynchs proposal until Sunday night They said the governor was briefed Monday morning and that he did not urge his PUC appointees to delay the increase An Edison official said the utili ty received the proposal late Monday morning and had little time to prepare fo r a hasty PUC hearing on the increase that afternoon The two commissioners appointed by former Gov Pete Wilson Richard Bilas a nd Henry Duque said they have been urging a rate increase But both complaine d of the short notice and the lack of time to study the complex proposals approved yesterday Davis aides said they do not understand how Lynch arrived at an increase of cents per kilowatt hour The governor is waiting for estimates of state pow er purchases this summer available generation the effect of conservation th e potential for federally ordered refunds from generators and other data before he makes a rate decision The Davis appointees on the commission Geoffrey Brown and Carl Wood prais ed Lynch for showing courageous leadership The increase approved yesterday which utility spokesmen said was the large st in their history comes on top of a percent residential increase for Edis on and PGE imposed in January and a scheduled percent increase next March when a rate reduction paid for by a billion bond expires Lynch said the rate increase approved yesterday takes effect immediately bu t will not show up on customer bills until May or later The PUC is working o n a plan to design the increase to encourage conservation giving the biggest increases to those that use the most electricity About percent of the utilities residential customers will have no increase because of legislation exempting households that use percent o r

nuclear vessels as source of power By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March WASHINGTON As California braces for more blackouts this summer a key House Republican has floated a plan that includes mobilizing a federal disaster agency waiving some environmental regulations and exploring wheth er nuclear reactors aboard Navy ships could be connected to the power grid Several Democrats immediately attacked the plan for not including electrici ty price controls sought by Gov Gray Davis and other California officials Th ey also charged that it would undermine clean air laws The point plan was drafted by Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the House Commerce Committees energy and air quality subcommittee Copies were obtained by Copley News Service Samantha Jordan a spokeswoman for Barton confirmed that he had circulated some proposals for responding to the Western power crisis among subcommitte e members late last week Some of the ideas were deleted before the list was forwarded to the White House Jordan added but she would not say which one s Barton has presided over several hearings on the power crunch and has said that he is more than prepared to draft legislation to help California A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is also developing a national energy policy President Bush has repeatedly stated his opposition to caps on wholesale power prices He has called for a concerted effort to increase energy production The list of ideas Barton sent to subcommittee members was aimed at boosting power generation and transmission in the West increasing conservation and preparing for blackouts Some of the production and transmission measures called for quickly expandi ng a crucial power conduit in the Central Valley known as Path using feder al funds for all or part of the project allowing small power generators to se ll electricity to buyers other than the states cashstrapped utilities and establishing standards for allowing businesses with onsite electricity generation to send surplus supplies to the power grid Other steps sure to be unpopular with environmentalists could be taken if a state declares an electricity emergency In addition to the idea of harnessing the energy from nuclearpowered Navy ships and submarines they include temporarily waiving nitrogen oxide emission limits at power plants allowing the construction of generating plants on federal and Indian lands restarting mothballed nuclear reactors and delaying for a year a plan to divert water in Californias Trinity River from power generation to environmental restoration On the conservation side Barton proposed allowing states to lengthen daylight savings time and requiring federal facilities to reduce energy use by percent Finally the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be directed to open an office in California conduct an educational campaign to prepare the public for blackouts and have a plan ready to provide assistance during power outages Barton has been skeptical of the idea of having the federal government limi t the cost of wholesale power in the West and did not include that among his proposals Instead he said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should investigate whether wholesale prices are unjust and unreasonable a finding FERC already has made once That drew the criticism of four California Democrats Reps Henry Waxman of Los Angeles Anna Eshoo of Atherton Jane Harman of Torrance and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara who sit on the House Commerce Committee They sent a letter to Barton on Friday spelling out their objections Hes left off the ton gorilla solution which is directing the FERC to impose a reasonable cap on the price of wholesale electricity Harma n said The Democrats also said that Bartons proposals would undermine the Clean Air Act and that there is widespread agreement among those directly involved in Californias electricity system that clean air rules are not responsible for electricity shortages Bush calls California energy crisis ominous But he foresees no quick relief opposes controls By George E Condon Jr COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March KALAMAZOO Mich President Bush yesterday made his most extensive remark s yet on the energy crisis in California calling the situation ominous and proclaiming that the time to act is now Despite that pledge though he held out little hope of any speedy relief f or the hardhit state He also restated his opposition to energy price control s The president who has previously addressed the energy crunch only in answe rs to reporters questions used a state of the economy speech to a business group at Western Michigan University to elaborate on his stillevolving energy policy He broke no new ground in his remarks but seemed to be reacting to West Coast criticism that the federal government should be more aggressive in finding a solution to the rolling blackouts plaguing the nations most populous state The energy problem wasnt created overnight and we wont solve the problem overnight he said But we will at least start down the right road so tha t the shortages we face today will not recur year after year He said a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney will come up with a longterm strategy but he ruled out any move by his administration that would remedy the crisis quickly Well not solve the energy problem by running the energy market from out o f Washington DC he said We will solve the energy problem by freeing th e creativity of the American people to find new sources of energy and to develop the new technologies that use energy better more efficiently and more cleanly He singled out for criticism any call that Washington cap energy prices This administration does not and will not support energy price controls he said to applause from the businessoriented audience Price controls do not increase supply and they do not encourage conservation Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s And the United States will not repeat the mistake again He portrayed the energy crisis as a clear threat to his hopes of revitalizi ng the national economy And he signaled that he understands Californians are facing hardships The lights are dimming in California Consumers and businesses in Californ ia are paying sharply higher energy bills And as we compare our future energy needs to the currently projected domestic energy supply we see an ominous growing gap he said He said the blame for the problem belongs to previous decisionmakers Our people are paying a high price for years of neglect And the time to a ct is now he said Meanwhile Bush said he would nominate utility regulators from Texas and Pennsylvania to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC the agency that has played a pivotal role in the California crisis However Bush stopped short of replacing the chairman of the commission Curtis Hebert who has drawn fire from Gov Gray Davis and other California officials for his outspoken faith in open power markets and staunch opposition to federal controls on the soaring price of wholesale power sold in the West There was widespread speculation that Hebert a Republican was on his way out as chairman A White House spokeswoman would not say whether Bush has ruled out naming another commissioner to the top job at a later date Bush nominated Patrick Henry Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell to round out t he fivemember commission Wood is chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was an adviser to Bush on energy issues during the presidential transition Many observers ha d expected Bush to name him chairman of FERC Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Both nominees who face Senate confirmation were praised by power industry officials and consumer groups They have helped steer deregulation plans in their states that are thought to be on sounder footing than Californias failed experiment Rate hike means new political heat for California governor By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS March SACRAMENTO Rolling blackouts and a record increase in electricity rate s are putting the political squeeze on Gov Gray Davis just as he prepares for hi s reelection campaign The Democratic governor took a hit Tuesday when the Public Utilities Commission three of its five members appointed by Davis approved the very rate hikes he has repeatedly said would not be needed The power crunch is just the weakness political foes are looking for it could leave everyone from business owners to consumers looking for someone to blame at the polls next year Hes the face of the problem right now and so he is going to be the target said Nancy Snow a political scientist at the University of California Los Angeles Davis already has been criticized as having a leadership style that is a little bit too much in the mushy middleoftheroad area Snow said Thats something that he is going to have to overcome in order to politically survive this crisis California Republicans blame the firstterm governor for four widespread power outages this year that they call Grayouts His first major challenger in GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones is making energy a campaign centerpiece A top state financial official and fellow Democrat Controller Kathleen Connell says Davis decision to buy power for Southern California Edison a nd Pacific Gas and Electric is putting the state in financial danger And Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling about Davis handling of t he crisis as consumer groups threaten a revolt on the ballot With up to million Californians affected by the rate hikes consumer activists hope to attract millions of rebels to the polls The PUC voted unanimously to immediately raise rates up to percent for Edison and PGE customers saying that would reduce power use this summer a nd help keep the cashstarved utilities in business The increases which come on top of alreadyapproved hikes of to percent and a percent increase planned next year are the biggest in state history Davis issued a written statement Tuesday easing his ardent opposition to a rate hike While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Davis aides are frantically trying to deflect criticism surrounding the increase and assure voters the governor is working to build more power plan ts and boost conservation to avert blackouts during the hot summer months Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor opposes a rate increase bu t has no power to order the PUC to maintain current rates They are an independent body they can do what they want Maviglio said He insisted the governor wasnt informed of PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynchs plan to announce a rate increase Monday declaring to reporters Its not a story its the truth Still some Republicans and Democrats have said the governor has been inconsistent about his pull with the commission He announced last week at a dinner with state labor leaders that he had directed the PUC to order utilities to start paying overdue bills to facilities that produce renewable energy In addition Davis administration officials informed several key Assembly members Friday that the states powerbuying for Edison and PGE could cost far more than the billion lawmakers and Davis estimated when they approved legislation authorizing the power purchases making a rate increas e of percent or more necessary He is fully dedicated to solving this thing he doesnt just want to lay i t on the lap of a ratepayer or a taxpayer and hes trying to come up with wa ys to do that Maviglio said The national attention the power problems draw is raising Davis name recognition around the country for better or worse as he consider s whether to make a presidential run in Davis has been making the rounds on the national TV news and Sunday morning talk shows to explain to the nation why the lights have been going out in California He has attempted to shield himself by continually commenting that he inherited the energy problems thenRepublican Gov Pete Wilson signed the utility deregulation bill largely blamed for the crisis and Californi a went years with no new power plants Davis says Republicans turn the criticism back at him The state GOP has already run radio ads criticizing Davis handling of the power problems and are launchi ng an allout effort to blame him for the rate increases Its a colossal failure of mismanagement on the part of the governors PUC said Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge But even with the energy crisis Republicans have their work cut out for th em in The state GOP long shackled by infighting between moderates and conservatives is in the minority in the Legislature holds just one statewide office Jones and must come up with millions to match the nearl y million Davis had raised nearly two years before the election And polls have shown residents growing increasingly frustrated with the energy crisis but not blaming Davis Those surveys were taken before Tuesdays rate hike and before California was hit last week with rolling blackouts from San Diego to the Oregon border The governors political campaign isnt taking any chances moving quickly to bite back at critics Garry South Davis chief political adviser issued a statement Tuesday saying Jones has failed to put forth his own solution Put your megawatts where your mouth is South said PUC Approves Largest Electricity Rate Increase in States History Regulation Some customers will pay up to more Commissioners facing strong opposition before their unanimous vote say they are trying to avert blackouts Critics say move wont solve the crisis By NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writers PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Richard Bilas show strain of t he meeting at which the panel announced a rate hike We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said ROBERT DURELL Los Angeles Times SAN FRANCISCOWith protesters jeering their disapproval besieged utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the states history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights on for millions of customers The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an increase of cents per kilowatthour That will boost rates by as much as for some Southern California Edison customers and up to for some served by Pacific Gas Electric Co The rate increase which will cost customers nearly billion a year takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at lea st May The rate hike is the most farreaching and politically volatile action the state has taken thus far to ease an monthold power crisis that has nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts But critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale electricity prices The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that are unjust and unreasonable said commission President Loretta Lynch We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on I believe that adding another cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state Department of Water Resources for the nearly billion in power it has purchased for them since midJanuary The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to operate The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by loss of power from such companies But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU C headquarters And the drama of the voteand the vocal oppositionspurred each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action These are extraordinary moments in Californias history declared Commissioner Geoffrey Brown a recent appointee of Gov Gray Davis And extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage Loretta Lynch has take n a lot of bad hits But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in California Rate Increase Lacked Support Lynch proposed the rate increase even though an administrative law judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUCs o wn consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates opposed it She also did not have the public support of Davis who appointed her and two other commissioners Davis has distanced himself from the PUCs action saying the commissi on was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa se is necessary Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilaswho were appointed by Republican Gov Pete Wilsoncalled the rate hikes long overdue Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this summer we have to start paying our power bills Duque said It cannot be done with the current rates Saying there is just no blood left in the turnip Bilas warned that absent an immediate rate increase the utilities will be in Bankruptcy Court Before the vote signcarrying protesters chanted Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay And the commission heard a parade of witnesses most opposing the rate increase Some called on the state to use eminent domain to seize power plants as Davis said he might do as a last resort Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San ta Monica told the commission Go to these power pirates and tell them the state treasury is not their money orchard Barbara George of Womens Energy Matters said We should give the generators hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave Geor ge was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting At a hearing Monday representatives of agriculture and manufacturing industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the California economy The rate hike is the states largest according to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which researched the issue Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly utility bill the overall effect will be about a increase in monthly bills said PUC staff Before the PUC action homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid cents per kilowatthour for electricity and another cents per kilowatthour for other services The new rate totaling cents per kilowatthour boosts the overall bill by about The increase is about for PGE residential customers But under Lynchs proposal those increases would not be applied equally To encourage conservation she seeks a tiered system that would charge miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the new higher rates on bigger users The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use or more beyond a socalled baseline amount which is about half of the average residential use per month and varies by region Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by the PUC in hearings over the next month Under Lynchs proposal nearly hal f of all residential customers would be spared rate increases Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation but they disagree about how much Davis energy advisor S David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said utilities have long used tiered rates when charging lowincome customers So this is not brand new Its just a more aggressive use of it he said UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates would do much to stave off blackouts The greatest conservation gains come from investment in efficient appliances he said and thats why tiered rat es are no magic bullet The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the earliest said Paul Clanon chief of the PUCs energy division The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t he new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated retroactively and charged to future bills Clanon said Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at the question of whether the rate hike will be enough Have we gotten the number right Duque said I dont know I hope w e have But this is a step in the right direction and well return any money not used to buy power Bruce Foster a Southern California Edison vice president also said t he rate increase is a step in the right direction Only time will tell he said if it is sufficient to meet the need In a statement PGE welcomed the PUC action as a dose of realism b ut said the commission left unresolved a host of issues including how much money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for PGE customers The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional billion annually from the million people served by Edison and PGE But that amount doesnt go far in todays California wholesale electricity market The state and utilities spent billion in January buying electricity The state through the Department of Water Resources has spen t nearly billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the utilities since Jan because power generators refused to sell to the cashstrapped utilities Money utilities collect from their customers even with the new rate hike is expected to cover a wide array of expenses including payments on billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spri ng to cover the states cost of buying power The numbers dont add up said Jason Zeller an attorney with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates Massive additional rate increases are my concern We are sticking a finger in the dike unless wholesale prices come down Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to th is story With Energy Crisis Far From Over Experts Say More Hikes Possible Power PUC action leaves questions unanswered such as how to handle utilities debts whether to buy grid By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers As painful as Tuesdays electricity rate increase will be for some consumers power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and threatened its economy Because of that still more rate hikes are possible they say Consumer advocates power company officials legislators and regulator s disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the states problems But th ey agree that Californias energy woes are dizzyingly complex And the rate hi ke makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem Is it over Heavens no said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg DLos Angeles who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power supply issues Its a necessary step but were certainly not out of the woods yet The increase along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC did resolve two major issueshow the state will continue to buy electricit y that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how electricity consumers will repay Californias treasury for those purchases But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions what to do with the roughly billion in debt the states two biggest utility companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power whether the state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own where to find about billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative energy many of whom have not been paid in months and how to wrap up negotiations to sign longterm contracts with generators to supply power in years to come Said PUC President Loretta Lynch Until we can get wholesale prices under control and get folks to conserve were going to be in this pickle f or a while Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was crucial because the state is spending million to million a day to b uy electricity To cover those costs the state is supposed to float bonds which would be repaid from electricity bills But without the higher rates officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments And without the bonds all state taxpayersand not just customers of the priva te utilitieswould be on the hook for the debt In addition to raising rates the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula th at will determine the size of the bond issue expected to be the largest of it s kind in US history The formula allows for billion in bonds The states three major private utilities Southern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and S an Diego Gas Electric will have to determine how much power the state is buying for themthe figure is roughly and use a proportionate amount of the money they collect from customers to pay the state back A billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimate s that pegged it at billion But even the larger number is far less than some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state is buying Unless prices are stabilized state Treasurer Phil Angelides and other s have warned further bond issues may be needed Those in turn could requi re more rate increases Its possible that with the rate increase and if we do a good job wi th conservation its possible that the bonds may be less said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray Its also possible that given the situati on this summer where we have not been able to secure anything close to our power needs we could be paying significantly more The rate increase which kicks in only for customers who use significantly more power than a baseline amount is intended to ease the situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demandforcing energy hogs to switch off spa pumps or pay the price as Lynch put it But no one can predict how the hogs will respond or whether the rate hikeplus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the completion of several new power plants this summerwill be enough to spare the state from forced outages Tuesday did little to fuel optimism Despite temperatures far milder than on a typical summer day another Stage energy alert was declared by the states Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply The state avoided blackouts but it was really close a CalISO spokeswoman said Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months with no outages but private forecasters see at least hours of blackouts And Reliant Energy one of the power plant owners predicts hours of blackouts in the state this year Beyond the problems of supply the state has still not resolved the question of the utilities debt Edison and PGE say theyve lost nearly billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices that the states deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an additional billion in revenue annually most of that will go to paying off bonds and other expenses None is earmarked to relieve the utilities debt When you do the math the amount of money just doesnt get you very far said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the picture Gov Gray Davis wants the state to pay billion for the lines PGE and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills and become creditworthy once more But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogge d down Meanwhile support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be slipping Republicans have long been opposed but now support among Democra ts is waning Keeley a critic of the transmission purchase all along believes that the state should instead buy the utilities hydroelectric generators contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the dams Were just going to sink dough into that transmission system Keel ey said adding that the grid needs an estimated billion in repairs The hydro system by contrast would be a revenueproducing asset that could he lp lower rates he said A related questionstill unresolvedis the fate of the states nearl y producers of alternative and renewable energy which supply more than a quarter of the electricity used by California consumers In a separate acti on Tuesday the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producerswhose megawatts are desperately needed and who in many instances have not been paid since November On Tuesday the small producers delivered a little more than half of their usual supplies to the utilitiesa trend that has dragged on for several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts Producers welcomed the PUCs order that they start getting paid But they said the move failed to address back payments estimated at billion owed by Edison and PGE Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Thir d World countries than they do in the state of California griped Marty Quin n executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which owns three small gasfired generators Any move to resolve that issue of course would increase the debt owe d by the utilities On another front state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal longterm electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the volatile spot market So far only contracts have been signed in part because generators are reluctant to commit to lower prices while theyre still owed billions o f dollars by the nearbankrupt utilities Experts say the power secured by th e current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need th is summer Despite all the unsettled questions at least one utility analyst Dan Ford of the Lehman Bros investment firm said the PUCs actions should remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the California cloud over electricity generators But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall Street Standard Poors said it would continue to carry a cautionary cred it rating for the state The rating agency which placed California on a credit watch after t he state government began spending millions to purchase electricity said in a news release that it was not clear whether the rate hike would be enough Hovering in the background meanwhile is the threat of a ballot initiative that could unravel whatever solutions state officials ultimately craft Leaders of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights have vowe d that any utility bailout would likely trigger a voter revolt The rate increase certainly makes an initiative more likely the foundations lobbyist Doug Heller said Tuesday If Gov Davis does not protect the public from profiteers Heller said his group is ready to pu sh forward with an initiative in Times staff writers Virginia Ellis Dan Morain Tim Reiterman Nancy RiveraBrooks Julie Tamaki Nancy Vogel and Rone Tempest contributed to th is story NEWS ANALYSIS Davis Keeps His Distance From Utility Rate Hikes By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis convinced that he cant win votes by delivering bad news avoided the task of telling Californians what virtuall y all experts have been saying for monthsthat electricity bills are going u p Indeed on Tuesday the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance himself from a rate hike of as much as that was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission led by his appointee Loretta Lynch That and other recent moves have thrown Davis credibility into questioneven in his own Democratic Party If youre the governor said political consultant Darry Sragow you dont want to take the blame for a massive rate increase that is not going to sit well with a lot of voters You want to be in a position where you can say I didnt have a choice my back was against the wall Davis describes his view of the situation as optimistic He has call ed it an energy challenge not a crisis even as the states two largest utilities border on bankruptcy and the state experienced blackouts a week ago in midMarch when electricity use was less than it will be in the summer when demand is highest Davis and his aides say the governor is fully engaged in the problem understands its many dimensions and is working long hours to solve it But the crisis wears on and an increasing number of lawmakers including fello w Democrats are alarmed Its an energy crisis not an energy challenge said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who began warning of a coming energy shortage months ago This is a major crisis Sen Don Perata DAlameda said and it would appear he is overwhelmed by it If you dont face reality said Sen John Vasconcellos DSanta Clara you cant possibly improve it His posture has been baffling I lament what is going on This is my beloved state and were in serious peril and it scares me Many academics utility executives Wall Street analysts and legislato rs concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary given the soaring wholesale price of electricity Even Davis has acknowledged that a rate hike might solve the situation Believe me Davis said Feb if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes But in a reaction that added to lawmakers bewilderment Davis said in a statement Tuesday that the PUC action was premature because we do not have all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision Until we do the statement continued I cannot support any rate increase In taking steps to raise rates Lynch may well end up taking substanti al flak for her governor Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state Sragow said Gray Davis is still popular Voters clearly dont see a connection between the governor and the PUC Davis aides say the governor didnt talk to Lynch before she acted Lynch a frequent visitor to the Capitol was in Sacramento late last week and again Tuesday She may not have spoken to Davis but she did make other top administration officials aware of her plans Lynch could have decided to act on her own The state Constitution giv es the commission authority to raise utility rates But the governor is well known as a micromanager involved in the most minute details of state governance Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to thi nk like I think and not to act on their own As recently as last week Davis directed that the PUC take specific actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid Davis has said the Legislatures job is to implement his vision He ha s said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should resign His appointees should not be free agents So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch wou ld move to raise rates Tuesday particularly given events that occurred late last week On Friday Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy one of h is top aides met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors At the meeting a participant warned that rates might have to rise to Also Friday a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis staff was convinced that a rate hike was necessary even as Davis continued to public ly oppose it On Sunday a top Davis aide referred reporters to Lynch who confirmed that she would move to raise rates Tuesday Two months ago Harry Snyder of Consumers Union was defending Davis Now Snyder who has worked with Davis on various issues for decades is like many others raising questions about the governors credibility his penchant for secrecy and his competence Something is wrong Snyder said Either he is over his depth or it is hubris or it is the great river in Egypt Denial Here are some of the governors statements and actions since called into question Davis held a news conference Feb to say he had reached an agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a deal to buy its massive transmission system for billion A final package he said would be announced within a week not only with Edison bu t with San Diego Gas and Electric A month later a top utility executive described the talks as dreadfully slow Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas Electric which he said back in February would be completed by now are eve n further behind Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with independent generators to buy power He said however that the contracts accounted for to megawatts of electricity this summer a significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy muc h of its power on the far more costly spot market Last week when he released some scant details in a report on the contracts experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market Davis brushed aside reporters questions last week about the blackou ts that rolled across the state He remained cloistered as the outages continu ed for a second day emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensu re that alternative energy producers would be paid A week after he called on lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid the legislation remains stalled It is inept at all levels and doesnt encourage any confidence that h e can handle it Snyder said Moreover it doesnt encourage us that he is going to tell the truth The energy crisis is perilous for Davis reelection effort next year But the governors strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes could be to his benefit when he faces voters Ethically said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain not bei ng forthcoming is worse Politically the more he can obfuscate the more like ly it is some people will buy the obfuscation The reason we see obfuscation is that obfuscation works Not all politicians follow that maxim Davis predecessor Republican Gov Pete Wilson held a news conferenc e in as California plunged into a recession to announce that he was pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history calling it necessary to help erase a billion deficit Top advisors had urged him t o leave the delivery of such bad news to others Any time you deliver bad news to voters youre taking a risk said D an Schnur who was Wilsons spokesman But it is a much bigger risk to allow a situation to fester without preparing voters for decisions that have to be made Nobody likes pain Schnur said But they are much more willing to tolerate it if they understand why it is necessary Federal Energy Agency Unlikely to Order Refunds Power Regulatory panel says much of the overcharge alleged by CalISO is beyond its jurisdiction and questions whether the rest is excessive By MEGAN GARVEY and RICHARD SIMON Times Staff Writers WASHINGTONWhat are the chances that federal regulators will order electricity wholesalers to refund billion in alleged overcharges Zero Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have already made clear that nearly billionalmost half the total that Californias grid operator said last week was excessiveis off the table because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place before Oct beyond their reach As for the rest lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observe rs note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority t o enforce fair and reasonable rates because of difficulty in defining that phrase Some within FERC question how much of the excessive rates documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERCs jurisdictionfor example rates charged by municipal power suppliers that are not regulated by the federal agency So far FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund only million in alleged overchargesjust of the amount that the CalISO has identified That sum deals only with rates charged in January a nd February during Stage alertsperiods when electricity reserves fall below FERCs approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably no t become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon have President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill vacancies on the fivemember commission the White House announced Tuesday The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III chairman of the Texas Utility Commission and a Bush ally and Nora Mead Brownell a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to the FERC governing board Administration officials have indicated that Wood would assume th e FERC chairmanship a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr a staunch advoca te of energy deregulation ShakeUp at FERC Was Expected The shakeup has been expected because of continuing complaints that FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West Hebert in particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity sales Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California s plight replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Sena te Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss CalISO officialswho pointed out that their billion figure was part of a study calling for stronger market controls not for refundsmay still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and Februar y FERC ordered wholesalers to justify million worth of charges shortly after CalISO asked for million in refunds for December and January FERCs refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulato rs who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of supply and demand At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to date in California as well as future rates And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophie s of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it What role should the governmentspecifically FERC an agency with a mandate to ensur e fair and reasonable ratesplay The whole notion that theres such a thing as a just price is kind of an anachronism from New Deal days said Pietro Nivola a Brookings Institu te scholar who studies regulatory politics Especially as we move closer to some form of deregulation weve come to understand that the price is what the traffic will bear In this case utilities simply have to be able to ge t higher rates at the retail end But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority allowing the wholesalers to operate with impunity The message FERC has sent so far is as long as you leave cents of every dollar in the bank we wont pull the alarm said Mark Cooper direct or of research for the Consumer Federation of America Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERCwhile highly unlikelywould go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices But FERC officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm than good potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market already too tight The memory of the s oil crisis and a prevalent view among economists that government intervention made matters worse has inform ed the views of some longtime government officials and observers Refunds Called Inferior Remedy A clear sign of FERCs reluctance to call for refunds came late last year when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for t he California price increases FERC officials said at the time Refunds may b e an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental soluti on to any problems occurring in California markets The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Sta ge alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month by some lawmakers and utility company officials They complained that the narr ow focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers believed were outrageous But even the million questioned by FERC has been defended by the wholesale companies In briefs filed with the agency last week they said rates exceeding per megawatthourcompared with a precrisis average of per megawatthourwere justified by the increased credit risk wholesalers took in selling to nearbankrupt utilities that have billions o f dollars in outstanding debts Duke Energy which FERC has said overcharged California by million signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price company president Ji m Donnell said this week If we are not assured payment the credit premiums are obviously appropriate and we would reserve our right to collect the entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order Both of Bushs Republican nominees to the commission are expected to w in Senate confirmation But they can expect a grilling from Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif who has accused power suppliers of pricegouging and FERC of doing little to stop it Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether theyre going to be responsive to the present situation Feinstein said Tuesday grousing that the administration has been recalcitrant to the point of arrogance Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney head of a White House energy task force but she described the meeting as disappointing Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the California crisis and adding a handwritten note The West needs your hel p A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners would have a more sympathetic ear for the concerns of the Western states But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to price controls Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s and the United States will not repeat the mistake again he said in a spee ch in Kalamazoo Mich The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn The grou p expressed confidence that they would be strong proponents of completing th e muchneeded transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all across the country Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment Wood said in a statement On our best day as regulators we cannot deliver benefits to customers as well as a functional market can But the market must work righ t first Wednesday March A Painful Step Electricity rate increase may help but Gov Davis is yet to offer an understandable plan to end the crisis By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users the state Publi c Utilities Commission finally has recognized the grim reality of the electricity market in California even if Gov Gray Davis has not Electricity costs more these days even aside from the piratical rates charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency The increase while probably necessary will not by itself solve the crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer The two biggest private utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric still are saddled with as much as billion in debt for past power purchases State government still is shelling out some million in daily power purchases and has committed as much as billion to future power contracts Davis continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities share of the state powe r transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities debts Despite all the handwringing and armwaving nothing that state government has done since January has provided any significant new power generation or conservation Consumers are right to wonder what happened to a promised statewide conservation campaign After first ducking the power problem Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year most of them still works in progress But he still has not given the people an understandable coherent plan for getting out of this fix Worse he refuse s even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future The irony of Tuesdays rate increase is that the state might have dodg ed much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago But Davis seekin g reelection next year insisted that the crisis be solved within the existi ng rate structure Late last week he attended a political fundraiser at a Pa lm Springs golf club while his staff was being briefed on the need for higher rates literally distancing himself from the act The rate increase which will be drafted over the next days affect s customers of Edison and PGE but not residents of Los Angeles or other citi es with full municipal power systems The stated intent is that bigger users particularly businesses will pay higher rates and be encouraged to save major amounts of power during the summer Under one scenario nearly half o f householdslow and medium userswould pay no more than they do now The boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the states daily power purchases although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet the full cost The increase should be structured to give ratepayers some relief if lawsuits against power generators exorbitant pricing are successful in winning refunds Those skeptical ratepayers who believe that the crisis is just a big ripoff by the utilities and the energy companies will consider the increas e more of the same You cant blame them considering the lack of straight ta lk from the governor including his dodging of the rate issue However most state experts including Davis own utilities commissioners say the rate increase is a critical first step in solving Californias power problems If Davis has a plan to fix the problem some other way he should present it in detail to the people of California now PUC Votes To Jack Up Power Rates Tiered increases approved as protests disrupt meeting David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL The bill finally came due for Californias experiment with electricity deregulation as consumers were hit yesterday with the largest rate increase in state history an average percent jump in monthly power costs The immediate rate hike was unanimously approved by the Public Utilities Commission during a rowdy meeting that was repeatedly interrupted by chanti ng and jeers from protesters Highway Patrol officers were directed by PUC President Loretta Lynch to remove several demonstrators from the packed San Francisco auditorium These are extraordinary moments in Californias history and extraordinary moments demand extraordinary courage PUC member Geoffrey Brown said befor e the rate increase was passed The commissioners approved a new percent increase and made permanent a temporary percent increase adopted in January This will allow the states two largest utilities to charge customers an extra billion a year PUC members said higher rates will help overcome the wide disparity between skyrocketing costs charged by power companies for electricity and the relatively low amount paid by consumers under Californias deregulatio n law However consumers bills will not go up until a tiered rate system can b e introduced requiring those who use more power to pay higher fees That system is expected to be in place by May Gov Gray Davis who has tried to distance himself from the PUCs move sinc e it was unveiled Monday said in a statement yesterday that the rate increas e was premature and that he did not support the decision While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity he said Several PUC members acknowledged that such a huge rate increase might not have been necessary had the commission acted sooner to remedy Californias power woes We should have done this in January Brown said but we didnt have enou gh information This rate increase is long overdue said Richard Bilas who also sits on the commission We are finally transfusing some blood CONSUMERS PROTEST If so the donor ratepayers did not go willingly to the operating theater A number of citizens rose to speak at yesterdays meeting and not one was in favor of higher power rates This is being shoved down the peoples throats said Dorothy Diez an elderly San Francisco resident Why dont they put the bills where they belong and not on my back She and others called on state officials to take a harder line with outof state power generators which have reaped windfall profits by charging sky high wholesale prices for their electricity Consumer groups urged the PUC to support special taxes on the generators earnings or even seizure of the companies California power plants Your actions are reprehensible Ross Mirkarimi a publicpower supporter told the commission Do not do Gov Davis dirty work The governor did not attend yesterdays meeting but his presence nonethele ss loomed large over the proceedings Consumer advocates derided Davis claims this week that he played no role i n the decision to raise rates They noted that the governors appointees hold a majority on the PUC and worked closely with Davis on a variety of past issues Davis staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its decision DAVIS CONTROLS PUC Gov Davis controls the PUC said Doug Heller assistant organizing director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights He is responsible for the rate hike We are paying more because of the failure of his leadership It seems absurd that Gov Davis is saying his own agency is acting without his consent said Susannah Churchill head of energy policy for the California Public Interest Research Group Hes just looking for political cover The PUC decision was made on a day when Californias grid operators declare d a Stage alert the first in a week indicating that power reserves had dropped below percent When tiered rates are implemented customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co will see rates go up between percent for medium power users and percent for heavy users Those who can keep power consumption to within percent of pre established limits will see no increase beyond the percent rate hike adopted in January Customers of Southern California Edison will see rates increase between a nd percent Bruce Foster an Edison vice president called the rate increase a step in the right direction but said further increases may be needed to defray soaring power costs this summer PGE spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the PUCs decision more closely before determining whether a percent rate hi ke will be sufficient The PUC has done all it can said Lynch the PUC president We have foug ht back hard in every venue possible against unjust energy prices NO FEDERAL HELP In the end though she said state regulators were forced to admit that no help would be forthcoming from federal authorities in capping wholesale pow er rates and that generators would continue exploiting Californias chronic electricity shortage We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said Along the same lines the PUC approved a requirement that PGE and Edison repay the state Department of Water Resources for about billion in power purchases made on the cashstrapped utilities behalf The commission also passed a motion forcing PGE and Edison to pay smaller power generators for their output Half of all such generators were shut do wn during last weeks blackouts because they had not been paid by the utilitie s However the PUC is only requiring that utilities pay for future electricit y purchases and did not address the millions of dollars in payments still ow ed the power companies Ann MacLeod executive director of the California Cogeneration Council an association of smaller generators said that by avoiding the question of ba ck debt the PUCs move will do nothing to restore plants to operation These generators will not come back online as a result of this decision she said In fact a greater number likely will have to drop offline Protesters chanting Hell no we wont pay urged consumers after the PUC meeting to not include the higher fees in upcoming bills This is just the beginning said Medea Benjamin who was among the demonstrators evicted from

California Gov Gray Davis a nd Sen Dianne Feinstein both Democrats Both nominations require Senate confirmation and Feinstein indicated yesterday that she might oppose the nominations I would hope they would come in and talk with me she said Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether they would be responsive to the present situation Up to this point the administration has been recalcitrant to th e point of arrogance If that is the case with these new appointees as well they wont have my vote FERC regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines Curt Hebert named chairman by Bush earlier this year will remain in his post Although Heberts outspoken freemarket views are in sync with the administrations there had been speculation that Bush would tap Wood for t he top job Some thought Bush might want a familiar ally to head an agency tha t used to be a regulatory backwater but now is among the most politically sensitive spots in the administration Wood has overseen electric utility deregulation in Texas which is schedule d to open its market to competition Jan but based on a model that differs significantly from Californias scheme Texas has attracted ample n ew power generation since and is experimenting with partial retail competition for commercial users Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvanias electricity deregulation which is cited as a successful contrast to Californias experiment FERC has come under heavy political fire from California Democrats for not cracking down hard enough on alleged price gouging of California utilities by outofstate energy producers Hebert has been sharply critical of Californias response to its electricit y mess once describing Davis plan to take over the utilities transmission lines as nationalization He is adamantly opposed to price controls and enjoys the strong backing of fellow Mississippian and Senate Majority Leade r Trent Lott who pressured the White House to keep him Hebert and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham have voiced strong opposition t o price controls on wholesale electricity arguing that would worsen Californias blackouts by discouraging electricity sales from outside the state Vice President Dick Cheney who met informally with about senators in hi s Senate office yesterday also restated the administrations opposition to price caps telling Feinstein price controls would not work and citing thei r failure in the Nixon administration Feinstein who has said she equates helping California with the willingness to impose federal price caps called Cheneys response very disappointing There was really no overture Feinstein said There was very little willingness to help Not even an offer of help It is truly amazing to me because this crisis is not going to be confined to California What w e really need is a period of price stability and they keep going back t o Nixon and price controls and saying they dont work We all know that but what we are

rather tidily sums up Americas haphazard attitude toward energy conservation We gladly rally to trim our energy use by a few percent whether at home at work or in our cars but we ultimately feel little urgency to change the overwhelming wastefulness of our built environment During the past two decades weve done plenty of sparing at the spigot and that can only be applauded Weve passed minimal building energy standards such as Californias Title but then wiped out much of the savings by building the sort of needlessly bloated energyguzzling homes that now sprawl across acre after acre of on ce pastoral landscape Weve enacted minimum standards for gas mileage excepting SUVs but you dont drive one of those do you yet weve made little headway in curbi ng our reliance on the automobile itself How did we get into this jam A fair share of the blame for our disastrous landuse policies belongs at the feet of the very people who insisted they knew better the postwar city planners Theyve left us our current legacy of hyperorganized zoning ordinances that encourage in fact practically mandate urban sprawl These in turn hav e produced a national reliance upon the automobile that has only increased ON THE ROAD AGAIN AND AGAIN Flying in the face of all weve learned about the environment during the pa st decades the year set the alltime record for US automobile sales with some million cars and trucks sold And no wonder Americans remain autocentered Too many planners and state transportation departments still consider freeway expansion programs the solution to our mass transportation woes even though its been demonstrate d time and again that bigger highways merely invite more traffic instead of reducing it We consumers are to blame as well for buying into the idea that a snowballing trend of consumption is the very embodiment of success Were hooked on big houses but because housing prices are so high in the Bay Are a were willing to move out to less populated areas so we can afford them We willingly drive an hour or even two to get to work a commute that wou ld have been considered perfectly absurd even years ago Pretty soon of course the new community is as choked with cars and asphalt as the old one The real pity is that weve recognized the folly of these trends for decade s and weve done next to nothing to even protest them let alone change them PLANNING FOR THE PAST And thanks to the hidebound attitudes of so many civic planning departments little of substance has changed in our land use policy since the s Our hyperorganized zoning ordinances still jealously guard the outdated postwar ideal of the singlefamily home surrounded by largely useless strips of setback land and continue to frown on more intelligent arrangements such as zerolotline construction courtyard homes and mixed commercial and residential planning By all means save all the energy you can But while any move toward conservation is commendable its Americas

electricity rate hikes of up to percent for customers of Californias two largest utilities The increases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edis on Co which take effect immediately are the largest in California history Its terrible we will probably go out of business Sahouria said It s very simple we cannot afford any rate increases PUC commissioners who voted for the rate hikes said they were necessa ry to head off blackouts this summer and to keep the cashstarved utilities fr om going under However the PUC simultaneously ordered the nearly bankrupt utilities to pa y the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers and to pay producers of renewable energy for future electricity deliveries The PUC has done all it can commission president Loretta Lynch said We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices Not all PGE and Edison customers will face higher bills The PUC said it would create a tiered system that will protect lowincome customers and penalize those customers who use the most electricity Ratepayers have labeled the plan a ripoff that could hit as many as million

power alerts Wednesday morning as pow er reserves stayed above percent No explanation given after officials approve percent rate hike Posted at pm PST Tuesday March BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News After months of waiting for the states elected leaders to act California s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest electricity rate increase in at least two decades and offered no assurance s that more hikes wont be needed soon The cent per kilowatthour increase would boost average rates for all customers by percent although the precise residential and business rate s have yet to be determined It is effective immediately and will show up on bills in May The commissions vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political backdrop Gov Gray Davis who appointed three of its five members said he wasnt consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it But Davis after learning Sunday night about the plan apparently did not seek to block the commissions action Instead he issued a statement immediately after the vote that called it premature because we do not hav e all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Until w e do I cannot support any rate increase The commission however said it had no alternative but to raise rates considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billion s in taxpayer funds on power because its cashstrapped utilities are no longe r creditworthy But even some commissioners were uneasy Davis most recent appointee on th e commission Geoffrey Brown acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that we as commissioners had very little time to review this In fact an administrative law judge using much the same evidence that w as included in the decision to raise rates had concluded recently that no such increase was justified The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of cents pe r kilowatthour Previously officials with Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison had only sought a cent per kilowatthour increase Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain whether a cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormou s cost the state has incurred since it began buying power The state still doesnt know how much its effort to bail out PGE and Ediso n which involves a state purchase of the utilities highvoltage lines will cost Its also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on t he expensive electricity spot market this summer and whether an additional ra te increase would be needed to cover that Have we got the number right asked Commissioner Henry Duque in reference to the cent increase I dont know But I hope we have Roderick Wright DLos Angeles who chairs the Assembly Utilities Committee told the commission that he opposed the idea of approving any rate hike now until the state has a better idea of the total amount that consumers ultimately will have to bear By establishing a cent increase now well be back in a short time potentially doing it again he said To be nickeled and dimed to death as were doing here I dont think that does anybody any good Signs of confusion Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused While providing a welcome dose of realism PGE president Gordon Smith said in a prepared statement the rate hike and other actions taken by the commission Tuesday do not offer a comprehensive solution fail to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability Among PGEs major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated fo r their debts which they claim total about billion and whether PGE or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spo t market Bruce Foster an Edison vice president offered a similar lukewarm endorsement of the increase Im not saying that it will do it he said acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road but he calle d the hike a step in the right direction Rate hike vs bankruptcy Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced into bankruptcy the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger rate hikes to stabilize the companies finances A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one design ed by a bankruptcy judge Bilas said adding that he also was concerned abou t how the state appeared to be buying electricity like a drunken sailor But others reacted angrily to the commissions decision Several protesters hoisted signs at the meeting that read we wont pay and chanted rat e hikes go away make the energy companies pay Police later escorted them out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed at their noisy interruptions Instead of raising rates they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to use the states power of eminent domain to take over the power plants operated by companies accused of gouging the public The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing by the rules of society said Mike Florio senior attorney with The Utili ty Reform Network in San Francisco Theyre economic war criminals Officials in Davis office said Tuesday that they intend to review the commissions action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support i t or seek changes But to some people the governors claim of ignorance abou t the commissions plan and his seeming inability to do anything to stop t he rate hike from being approved severely strained credulity Give me a break said Sen John Vasconcellos DSan Jose Who appoint ed them and whos been giving orders all along Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consid er having consumers pay more for electricity If it becomes clear that a rat e increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state he said I will support one that is fair Dion Nissenbaum and Hallye Jordan contributed to this report Impact of increases will vary greatly Posted at pm PST Tuesday March BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News The rate increases approved Tuesday will hit Californians in very different ways The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most and nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all Although the details arent yet final state regulators say they intend to fashion a tiered structure to implement the higher rates Heres how th e proposal will affect your bill When do the higher rates kick in Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it wont appear on bills until May While regulators agreed that rates will rise th ey still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost Hearings are expected next month Once the structure is approved regulator s say utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesdays rate approval Do the new rates affect all Californians No The Public Utilities Commission which approved the rate increase has authority over only investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric which together ser ve about million homes and businesses The increase affects PGE and Edison but not San Diego Municipal utilities including Santa Clara Palo Alto Alameda Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt How will the new rates work Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial a nd powerguzzling residential customers pay a greater share Residential customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their baseline amount What is the baseline The baseline is considered the average household usage It was established years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electrici ty usage over that amount Does everybody have the same baseline No Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in electricity needs caused by regional climate household type and season How many baselines are there PGE residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among three climatic baseline territories the coastal areas including San Francisco and the Peninsula the East Bay and South Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains Within those territories there are separate baselines for singlefamily homes and multifamily apartment complexes as well as for homes with only electric appliances instead of both gas and electric In addition baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage Summe r rates begin May and winter rates begin Nov How do I find out my baseline Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatthours and the rate you are billed for that amount It also shows how much power you used over the baseline and the rate you were billed for it How does the baseline affect my bill Customers already pay about percent more for power they use over their baseline Under the proposed tiered rates PGE customers who use no more than percent of their baseline amount wouldnt pay any more than they d o now PGE customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average percent increase in monthly bills Those who use more than twice their baseline would see an average increase of percent Edison customers woul d have similar rates Almost half of the utilities customers dont exceed percent of their baseline Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase The increase can be calculated many ways The commission approved an increa se of cents a kilowatthour three times the cent surcharge approved in January which was made permanent Tuesday Because the cent increase averaged percent some have said that plus the cents amounts to a percent increase Others have added cents to the amount the utilities charge just for electricity which for PGE is now cents and come up with a percent increase Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges others have added cents to the average total rate of cents for all customers a percent increase Under the tiered proposal the average residential rate would rise percent from cents to cents But average bills for residents bills would increase up to percent depending on electricity use Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesnt apply to commercial and industrial businesses In fact the proposal calls for a proportionately greater increase for businesses which pay lower rates than residential customers Commercial customers would see a percent increase Industrial customers generally over kilowatthours a month would see a percent increase But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power Go v Gray Davis this month ordered percent rebates for all customers who redu ce electricity usage percent over last year between June and September Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on percent reduction of total consumption while commercial and industrial rebates wil l be based on percent reduction of peak load If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now will I have to pay more Possibly The

Naturalgasdependent alternative generators say that even if the major utilities begin paying them for energy it wont be enough cash State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to start paying alternativeenergy producers per megawatthour But alternative generators that use natural gas say thats at least below what it costs to produce the energy On the short run we cant generate said David Lloyd of NRG Energy Inc which this month shut down its megawatt plant in the Bay area that sel ls steam to the CH sugar factory next door It just costs so much for electricity Alternative generators have been paid little or nothing the past four months and are now collectively owed more than billion by the utilities The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or sh ut down their plants resulting in a megawatt loss to California enoug h to power million homes That was a factor in blackouts last week and th e states Stage energy alert Tuesday There are two classes of alternative generators renewables which use sola r wind or cleanburning technologies to produce energy and cogenerators which use natural gas to produce energy but share the heat output with a manufacturer Renewables which make up half of the alternativeener gy megawatts say theyre likely to continue producing but would like to be pa id what theyve been owed the past four months PUC spokeswoman Kyle Devine said per megawatthour should work for generators if the natural gas is transported through an Oregon pipeline a cheaper route rather than through a pipeline from the Southwest But a gas proposal that Ken Ross of Delta Energy Co in Santa Ana received Tuesday showed the transportation price

premature SP is unsure how conservation will affect revenue March By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate hikes saying he would support them if it becomes clear it is absolutely necessary for the good of the state The governors statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities Commission a panel controlled by Davis appointees endorsed a plan to rai se monthly bills by as much percent The increase eventually would be tied to a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more medium users those who conserve energy will pay moderately more and heavy users will pay a lot more Details of the plan are not yet set Davis called the PUCs decision premature saying scant information was available to justify increases While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear a rate increase i s absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Boosting electricity rates to help resolve Californias energy crisis is likely to increase the states billion revenue bond sale to billion or more entailing more interest charges and a longer payback Standard and Poors the Wall Street creditrating agency called the ratin g plan a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of electricity It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected and whether revenue s will slip under the rateraising formula as consumers respond by conserving electricity SP said Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided The state which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities says it has first rights to the money The utilities have challenged that California hopes to borrow billion by selling revenue bonds in May to cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December Through April those costs are expected to total billion The bond money also will be used to pay for power under longterm contracts which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used Critics have questioned whether billion will be sufficient PUC

Californias electricity crisis and sh e is once again appealing to the president to meet with her It was very disappointing Feinstein said in an interview after a minute meeting Cheney had with a group of senators I practically begged for a period of reliability and stability so we could get through th e summer and I didnt get any feeling back that there was going to be any help Cheney insisted Feinstein said that California has to straighten itself out and was not moved by the fact that the Public Utility Commission was poised to increase rates nearly percent After the meeting Feinstein sent President George W Bush a twopage lette r Your administration has not yet offered any constructive solution to this problem she wrote If the federal government continues to ignore the situation the result may very well be economic disaster for millions of small businesses and residents Feinstein wrote a final plea that Bush meet with her and Sen Gordon Smith ROre who is cosponsoring a bill authorizing shortterm regional price caps Bush on Tuesday reiterated his position against price caps in a speech in Michigan Feinstein has heard little sympathy for her state from colleagues who have repeatedly said Californians have not felt any real pain Rep Jennifer Dun n RWash recently complained that Californians were turning on their hot tu bs without worrying about paying higher costs Feinstein said such criticism is exaggerated But she said she hopes the ra te increase approved by the PUC will show critics the state is doing the righ t thing Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif who said she was not invited to meet with Cheney said she was concerned that the rate increase would be making consumers bear the brunt of the electricity crisis Before a rate increase is considered Boxer said the PUC should make sure average residential consumers and small businesses are protected and take whatever legal action is available against those generating companies who

Orange County Register The states power crisis hit your wallet Tuesday when state regulators hike d electricity rates as much as percent Your bill could be headed up as a result Here are answers to some of your questions about the rate hike Q How much more will I pay A Details of the plan havent been finalized But the idea is to create a threelevel rate structure Those who use more electricity will pay the highest rates and those who conserve will save Consumers who use less than l percent of their baseline power allocation will escape any increase We explain baseline below The rate increase will be distributed across the two higher tiers The Publ ic Utilities Commission over the next days will come up with a plan to determine exact rates for the two higher levels as well as for different types of customers such as residential and small business Q So what is baseline A Baseline is the portion of your usage considered necessary for essential s To encourage conservation its set below the amount most people use The percentage of Edison customers who use less than percent of baselin e is roughly percent in winter months and percent in the summer Because baseline is set based on the average households use it means a single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a homeowner with four children Baseline varies depending on where you live Warmer areas get higher baselines There are different baselines for the summer and winter People who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocation s Allelectric homes get higher baselines Q Whats the reason for this rate hike Are they really doing this to get people to conserve A Conservation is a side benefit The primary motivation is money The state has already shelled out billion buying power in the last three months for customers of the nearinsolvent utilities The state plans to issue bonds which will be paid for by consumers to cov er the power purchases But Wall Street bankers must have proof of a steady revenue stream a rate increase to convince them the bonds can be repaid However people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their power so the plan will also help reduce demand Q Im already conserving How can I cut my bill further A Its nittygritty time Replace your incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs Clean those coils at the back of your refrigerator Turn your air conditioner down or off Reduce the amount of time you use your po ol pump Many items in your house use electricity when they are plugged in even if theyre not in use You can cut consumption by unplugging your television computer coffeepot toaster and blow dryer Q When will I pay the increase A The rate hike takes effect immediately But it could take Southern California Edison a month to days to implement it so you could face retroactive charges on a followup bill Q I live in south Orange County and buy electricity from San Diego Gas Electric Co Does this plan affect me A No SDGE has applied for a rate increase but state regulators have not yet voted on that request Q Im outraged We didnt ask for deregulation and now were paying more How can I protest A Call or write you state lawmakers and the governor You can also join on e of the consumer groups fighting the rate hike such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights It is at The Utility Reform Network is at National Desk Section A RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA By EVELYN NIEVES The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAN FRANCISCO March Californias power regulators approved the large st utility rate increases in state history today in an effort to avert more rolling blackouts and keep the states principal electricity producers from collapsing in bankruptcy Despite Gov Gray Daviss repeated statements that no new rate increases would be needed to keep the states two largest utilities solvent the Stat e Public Utilities Commission said today that it had no choice but to raise rates by up to percent for customers of the two utilities to avoid a greater catastrophe if the companies went bankrupt We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices said Loretta Lynch the commission president and a Davis appointee who had proposed the increases on Monday Ms Lynch said that under a tiered rate system that would be hammered out within the next days heavy power users would face the greatest increase s while light users would face little or no increases Customers will see the rate increases in their May utility bills Perhaps percent of consumers under this system including the poorest residents who would be exempt will face no increase at all Ms Lynch said Heavy users will face increases of about percent she said Coupled with the average percent temporary rate increase in January that the commission made permanent today those consumers will pay percent mo re for utilities than they did in December But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates increase could feel the impact if commercial power customers from small businesses to megastores pass on their higher electricity costs through price increases Before the rate increases power costs in California were slightly higher than the national average but lower than the prices paid in New York and other Northeastern States Residential electricity users already pay an average of about a month state officials say In addition under a previous commission decision rates will go up an additional percent nex t year The commission which approved the rate increase to also voted to require that the two large utilities the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison reimburse the states Department of Water Resources billion spent on their behalf and begin paying alternative energy generators which account for more than a quarter of the states dai ly energy needs The two utilities have not paid their bills for months sayin g they are nearly bankrupt because under deregulation of the power industry wholesalers have been allowed to float prices while retail rates were cappe d The Department of Water Resources has spent million a day since January buying power on the utilities behalf Small alternative energy producers h ad not been paid at all for months with dire consequences For two days last week the states power managers were forced to order rolling blackouts across parts of the state in part because the small energy producers shut down half their capacity because they had not been paid The rate increases will make the payoff more feasible Ms Lynch said whil e encouraging energy conservation But a representative of the states alternativeenergy generators known as qualifying facilities complained that the commission did nothing to address the roughly billion the utilities owed producers Im not sure what our options are at this point if the state wants the qualified facilities to be a part of the solution said David Fogarty a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association and alternativeener gy cogenerators representing about alternativeenergy producers in California For those on all sides the commission seemed to raise as many questions as it answered Consumer advocates who interrupted the hearing five times questioned why the commission had decided on the vote so abruptly with onl y hour notice to the public Spokesmen for each of the utility companies said they had no idea what the rate increases would mean to the average customer until the tiered system was determined They also said they did no t know whether these new rates would mean the end of rolling blackouts They may know something that I dont know said Bruce Foster vice president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison speaking of the commissions vote outside the hearing room Mr Foster also complained that the commissions directive to begin paying bills to the state and the alternative energy producers or face a penalt y equal to the amount owed might be illegal and said that the company woul d look into appealing it Ron Low a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric also complained that the commissions actions seemed rushed and lacked specifics The rate increase will generate about billion a year for Pacific Gas a nd Electric unit of PGE and billion for Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International While those revenues will help the utilities buy power on the wholesale market in the future the commission made no provision for paying off about billion in debt accumulated by the utilities as a result of past wholesale costs That issue would be left to the governor and state legislators The commission heard public comment before the vote but did not answer questions afterward Consumer advocates were furious many blaming Governor Davis The governor today issued a statement calling the commissions move premature From the beginning Ive said that my main goal was to solve this problem while protecting the consumer from undue rate hikes Mr Dav is said The PUCs action today was premature because we do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Mr Daviss statement seemed to reflect the awareness he and his aides feel about the potential political backlash from big rate increases Even as oth er politicians warned that such increases would be necessary Mr Davis has vowed to avoid them On Monday he insisted that he had not spoken to any members of the commission about the rate increase proposal and that he had no control over its actions But Mr Davis appointed three of the bodys five members and since taking office two years ago he has been emphatic in saying that he expects his appointees to state boards and commissions to reflect his policies He also did not hesitate to complain that he could not control the previous members of the commission because they were Republican appointees and his aides acknowledged that top gubernatorial advisers had consulted with Ms Lynch and approved her plans Politicians in both parties said Mr Davis was trying to shift blame for an y rate increase to the commission while claiming that increases were approved over his objections They predicted that that effort could backfire by maki ng Mr

protesters jeered Hell no we wont pay California regulators approved electricity rate increases of up to perce nt Tuesday to head off blackouts this summer and keep the states two biggest utilities from going under The increases approved by the Public Utilities Commission are the biggest in California history and take effect immediately for the millio n people served by Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Ediso n Co The PUC has done all it can commission president Loretta Lynch said We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices The PUC also ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers Just how much wasnt known the state has not disclosed how much it has spent on various long and shortterm power contracts For the rate increase the commission said it will create a tiered system that will protect poor people and penalize customers who use the most electricity Lynch proposed the higher rates as a way to force electricity hogs to conserve and to help keep SoCal Edison and PGE solvent The plan is also seen as a way to protect Californias budget surplus whic h is being drained of million to million a day as the state buys powe r for the cashstrapped utilities Since the crisis began more than billion in taxpayer money has been spent to keep the lights on SoCal Edison and PGE say they have lost more than billion since last summer because of high wholesale electricity prices and because California s deregulation law prevents the utilities from passing those costs on to their customers Both have urged the PUC to raise rates Following the PUC meeting SoCal Edison said it will begin paying interest to bondholders after weeks of missing payments The rate increase will be on top of the percent to percent hike approv ed by the PUC in January and a percent increase already scheduled for next year Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a ripoff We are being held hostage by a handful of energy companies that under deregulation got control of our electricity supply said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Until our elected officials start acting to protect us we are going to be at their mercy at the mercy of this ripoff Democratic Gov Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that he has no power over the PUC However three of the PUC members are his appointees And his aides have told lawmakers that rates have to rise Residents already pay about per month for electricity cents per kilowatt hour to SoCal Edison and cents per kwh to PGE The latest rate hike would mean a percent increase for SoCal Edison customers and percent for PGE customers for electricity alone Since th e rates are bundled with other fees the average price of a kilowatt hour is closer to cents for SoCal Edison customers and cents for PGE customers Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much th e plan will cost customers because the effects of the tiered system are not known The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters and dismay over the plan was seen elsewhere Sam Sahouria owner of the Fox Plaza Grocery and Deli in San Francisco sai d rate hikes could be too much for his familyrun store to bear Its terrible We will probably go out of business he said Belinda Lazzerini who serves fruit smoothies at Jitters Shakes in Sa n Francisco said her electric bills have jumped to for her studio apartment The Laundromat has gone up from to so now we will have to clean our clothes by hand and dry them in the basement she said Its crazy The state has pledged to issue at least billion in revenue bonds to buy power for SoCal Edison and PGE bonds that would be repaid by the utilities customers However state officials have told lawmakers that sta te efforts to help the utilities could hit billion by Californias Independent System Operator declared a Stage alert Tuesday a s electricity reserves dropped to about percent The alert follows two days of statewide rolling blackouts last week and two others in January ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said many power plant s that use alternative sources of energy remained down in part because haven t been paid by the utilities

Acquisition of IPALCO by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The AES Corporation NYSE AES announced that it has completed its acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises the Indianapolis Indbased utility wit h MW of generation and customers in and around Indianapolis IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange of shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be exchanged for shares of AES common stock IPALCO common stock was suspended from trading at the close of the market on March Analysis The purchase of IPALCO an established and respected utility in t he Midwest will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an d further the companys aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid e of its business AES already owns CILCORP an energy services company whose largest subsidiary CILCO serves portions of Illinois and Missouri Note that pursuant to an SEC order AES will restructure andor sell its ownersh ip interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an exempt holding company under PUHCA Thus through the purchase of IPALCO AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has established In addition from this purchase we now know that AES along wi th being a global player intends to remain dominant throughout the United States as well Further the acquisition represents a rather bright development for AES considering that the company has recently encountered some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California First lets examine the value of AES acquisition of IPALCO Certainly th e MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow Jones Utility Average An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every

RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA Individualcom Wed Calif Regulators Raise Power Rates State backs rate hike But increase still may not resolve crisis By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers Published March SAN FRANCISCO Brushing aside the shouts and hisses of outraged protesters state regulators approved a billionayear utility rate hike Tuesday b ut couldnt guarantee that the increases will remedy Californias electricity crisis With activists chanting rate hikes no way and utility executives branding the decision as inadequate the Public Utilities Commission voted to raise rates about percent for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison The rate hike took effect immediately but probably wont show up in customer bills until May But while PUC commissioners said they were taking a bold step major holes remain in the states patchwork effort to save the two beleaguered utilitie s and ensure reliable energy supplies during what promises to be a long hot summer The higher rates wont pay off billions in old utility debts leaving PGE and Edison under the continued threat of a bankruptcy filing by power generators bondholders or other creditors The increases will likely curtail energy consumption but its unlikely the cutbacks will be enough to stave off rolling blackouts this summer The PUC put off a crucial decision on how to allocate the rate hikes across custome r categories and the final rate design could determine how much Californians will conserve The vote may not achieve one of its key goals reviving the wind farms cogenerators and other alternativeenergy producers that provide more than percent of Californias electricity Hundreds have shut down in recent weeks because o f nonpayment by PGE and Edison contributing to rolling blackouts March a nd After months of prodding the PUC approved what may well be the largest utility rate increase in Californias history saying it had no choice if i t was to shore up utility finances and lessen the risk of blackouts It raise d rates just under percent in addition to making permanent a percent surcharge approved in January The increased revenue will go to pay for the state Department of Water Resources power purchases on the utilities behalf and to alternativeenergy producers that supply a major chunk of the utilities power The PUCs move could make utility bankruptcies more palatable to state officials because it ensures payment for future power supplies Now if we have a bankruptcy a lot of bad things will probably happen but theres le ss risk to the general public of mass power disruptions said state Sen Debr a Bowen DMarina del Rey chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee PGE arguing that the PUC didnt go nearly far enough said it will demand the panel reconsider Todays actions while providing a welcome dose of realism in the ene rgy policy debate unfortunately do not resolve any of the key issues facing Californias policymakers PGE President Gordon Smith said Smith said the decision could worsen Californias energy problems by forcin g the utilities to pay the state Department of Water Resources which is buyi ng power on the utilities behalf ahead of other creditors An Edison vice president Bruce Foster said the rate increase is a step i n the right direction but added Only time will tell if its enough The company announced it will start making interest payments on defaulted bond and bank debts Edison and PGE both criticized the commission for sharply lowering the PUC s estimates of the utilities debts PUC commissioners acknowledged they have more work to do to resolve Californias energy mess and some hinted that additional rate hikes may b e in the offing Have we gotten the number right I dont know said Commissioner Henry Duque But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the billion will be enough to pay Californias ongoing power bills Meanwhile Gov Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Davis said Until we do I cannot support any rate increase While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increa se is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis approval three of it s members are Davis appointees and last Friday his aides shared data with business lobbyists indicating rates would rise substantially said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association Consumer advocates blasted rate increases as a surrender to the power generators that control much of Californias electricity Noting that the states grid operator has accused the generators of overcharging Californians by billion they urged the PUC to focus its firepower on those robber barons on steroids as Berkeley activist Barbar a George put it Its like dealing with the mob said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Instead of breaking our fingers theyre goi ng to turn the lights out again Jamming the PUCs auditorium to near capacity activists said the state should seize the generators power plants They razzed the commissioners wi th taunts of blood money and its a sham prompting guards to escort some protesters out PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters saying the generators are the real culprits in our energy crisis But she said the commission had to approve rate hikes The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power generators to refund some of their profits Lynch said the rate hikes would be refunded to customers if generators are forced to surrender money The higher rates will generate billion in additional yearly revenue f or Edison and billion for PGE according to PUC estimates But with most of the money going to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources for current and future power purchases the PUC action doesnt repay the billions the utilities owe to generators and other creditors You still have billion maybe more of costs that havent been paid fo r and thats still a problem said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Tradin g Forum an association of power generators I dont believe creditors are going to be infinitely patient The two utilities have defaulted on billions of debts and face a daily thre at of bankruptcy Thats still an issue that ultimately has to be addressed said Senior Vi ce President John Stout of Reliant Energy Inc a generator thats owed million Davis is negotiating to buy the transmission grid from Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co as a means of paying off the utilities existing debts But Bowen the Energy Committee chair said she doubts the deal will go through Beyond complaining the PUC didnt solve the existingdebt issue the utilities were dismayed by a change in PUC accounting that sharply lowers estimates of their debts and could have major impacts on how much control regulators keep over their operations for months to come Even though rates keep going up a state ordered rate freeze remains technically in effect a nd that freeze gives regulators ammunition to argue that utilities cant pass all their costs on to customers PGEs Smith called it the most egregious commission action Edison calle d it illegal The board voted to raise rates cents a kilowatthour and make permanent a cent increase approved in January Documents from Lynchs office said rat es would rise on average percent but Lynch later described it as percen t The PUC put off a decision on how the higher rates will affect each custome r category other than to say its leaning toward a system that will charge more for electricity consumed above a certain threshold The PUC estimated that percent of residential ratepayers those who use less than that threshold will see no rise at all Lynch proposed some businesses would s ee rate hikes of as much as percent How much conservation will this get us It will depend very much on how it s designed said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute The rate hikes wont affect customers of municipal utilities such as Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD is planning a percent rate hike The PUC vote may do little to help the hundreds of alternativeenergy producers known as qualifying facilities many of which have shut down fo r nonpayment The PUC on Tuesday ordered PGE and Edison to start paying these producers in April but some of the producers say the PUCs new pricing mechanism doesn t get them back on their feet financially Many following the lead of one Imperial Valley producer may choose to sever their contracts with the two utilities and sell their power elsewhere even out of state This is not a solution cogenerators lawyer Jerry Bloom said of the PUC vote It will drive additional plants off the system California can ill afford to lose suppliers On Tuesday the Independent System Operator which runs the power grid declared a Stage alert meani ng reserve supplies had dipped to less than percent of demand And many experts believe California wont be able to avoid blackouts this summer The severe drought hitting the Pacific Northwest will deprive California of a critical source of hydroelectricity

Bazar and Kevin Yamamura and Reuters ne ws service contributed to this report Batten down Electric storm brews By Gilbert Chan and Andrew LePage Bee Staff Writers Published March First higher gasoline prices hit DustTex Service Inc Then skyrocketing natural gas bills socked the Sacramento industrial laundry service Now a third financial blow looms higher electricity bills Its become a real nightmare Its pretty scary You have to find money to pay these bills said Sylvia Compton coowner of the longtime familyowne d south Sacramento business It could be worse for Compton whose business is served by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District It will be for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co who face rate hikes averaging percent in addition to a percent rate increase already approved The California Public Utilities Commission gave PGE and Southern Californi a Edison permission to raise electric rates by billion a year How the burden will fall on various customer groups hasnt been decided Although SMUD customers arent affected by the PUCs decision to sharply raise rates they arent likely to be immune SMUD also facing skyrocketin g energy costs is considering rate increases ranging from percent to percent For DustTex and scores of other California companies any rate hike would be another unwelcome increase in the cost of doing business It will hit at a time the US economy is slowing and employer costs such as health benefits are soaring For consumers it will mean a double blow higher electricity bills at home and higher prices for goods and services Raleys the West Sacramentobased supermarket chain for example uses hug e amounts of electricity not only for lights and refrigeration at its stores but also to cool food at its distribution centers Given the thin profit margins of the grocery business it has little choice but to raise prices We are doing all we can at Raleys to conserve energy But as rates go up we will have to pass those increases on to our customers in the cost of goods said Michael Teel Raleys president and chief executive officer The higher electric bills approved by the PUC aimed at keeping the state s two biggest utilities from bankruptcy mean California businesses and consumers will have almost billion less to spend each year on other things While that amount represents a huge bite out of consumer spending by itsel f it wont necessarily lead to a recession said Brad Williams senior economist at the state Legislative Analysts Office What were really talking about is less economic growth Williams said Some households will feel this and it will pinch their budgets and affect how much income they have for purchasing goods and services The state estimates that spending on electricity last year averaged between and percent of both business production costs and household budgets Some business owners and economists welcomed the boost in electricity rates saying in the long run they will spur energy conservation efforts boost power generating capacity and prevent rolling blackouts and their devastati ng effect on business productivity Its much worse for us if we have these damn blackouts We have employees and if theres a blackout theyre all sitting around twiddling their thumbs and Ive still got to pay them said Norm Rogers president o f ZWorld Inc in Davis which designs and builds miniature specialpurpose computers Many economists and business experts believe rolling blackouts not higher electricity rates are the biggest threat to the economy Its better to have higher rates and secure power than lower rates and blackouts said Stephen Levy senior economist at the Center for Continuin g Study of the California Economy The state can work through the higher powe r costs just as it did when gasoline and diesel prices soared last year Le vy said In reaction to the higher power rates a small number of businesses may lea ve California expand out of state or fail though most will be able to weath er the short run said Robert Smiley dean of the Graduate School of Managemen t at the University of California Davis Most firms will give the state just six to months to solve the energy crisis before theyll start looking elsewhere Smiley said David Molinaro owner of Yolo Ice and Creamery Inc a Woodlandbased ice cream dairy and ice distributor cant pick up and leave He absorbed high er diesel fuel costs for his delivery trucks for six months before levying a surcharge in January Theres just no way his company can eat the higher electricity costs he said Its frustrating People are thinking you are getting rich by raising prices Molinaro said Other businesses may have little choice but to swallow the higher utility costs We compete with global suppliers for almost every product Its virtually impossible for us to pass these costs on said Jeff Boese of the Californi a League of Food Processors If we dont get a handle on energy costs very quickly I would suspect a significant number of food processors to leave th e state In past months the rocketing energy costs have forced companies to take dramatic steps to shave expenses DustTex for example has scrapped pay raises raised prices percent c ut hours for some workers put a freeze on hiring and changed auto insurance coverage for its truck fleet At the same time it invested for a n ew energyefficient dryer California Family Health Fitness which has eight health clubs in the capital region has tabled plans for two additional gyms until it gets a better handle on future energy costs according to coowner Larry Gury But Gury and his partner are looking at spending to at each o f four gyms to install solar panels for heating the pools and running the lights Some impacts might not be seen for some time In the health care industry for example the energy crisis has only added to existing financial pressures said Larry Levitt vice president of the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation Pressed by higher bills some employers may opt to trim or eliminate health benefits for workers Levitt said Bee staff writer Lisa Rapaport contributed to this report Use more energy pay higher rates By Edie Lau Bee Science Writer Published March For all the talk of electricity rates going up across the state theres a way every resident of California can avoid the price hit altogether Just u se electricity sparingly A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesda y does not affect households that use less than percent of a baseline amount of power Fortyfive percent of households already stay within that limit according to PUC President Loretta Lynch The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas and Electrics territory percent utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUCapprov ed increase but is planning to raise rates this spring as well It too proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of kilowatthours used over baseline District rate administrator Alan Wilcox said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back their electricity use How difficult might that be If youre accustomed to using a central air conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat it could be difficult by Wilcoxs reckoning If youre running an airconditioning load in the Valley you could probab ly expect to get into that second tier above baseline a little bit he said There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or have swamp coolers or just go without In SMUD territory the baseline is kilowatthours per month in summer and kwh in winter for most customers Households that do not use gas a nd are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption at least it w as the average when the baseline was set in the early s Consumption has crept up a bit since to kwh a month last year Under SMUDs rateincrease proposal the summertime rate would remain at cents per kilowatthour for the first kwh The price would rise b y cents a kilowatthour for the next kwh used up to kwh Big energy consumers would pay more than cents for each kwh used over kwh Bottom line The biggest users pay the most Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC which will affect PGE customers as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric have yet to be worked out but the rates are expecte d to be structured in a similar tiered fashion Currently PGE customers yeararound pay cents per kilowatthour up t o the baseline limit and cents for every kilowatthour over baseline The average baseline throughout the territory is between and kwh Tabor said it varies from region to region to account for climate Tabor said the PGE baseline amounts to between percent and percent o f the average electricity use per household in a given territory That proportion she said was taken from a Lifeline program in effect from to that was meant to provide a minimum necessary quantity of electrici ty and gas at a lower cost Tabor said percent of PGEs residential customers use only baseline amounts of electricity Bee staff writer Carrie Peyton contributed to this report Regulators prescribe biggest rate increase in state history Davis calls ruling for PGE Edison premature consumer groups push for seizure of plants By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER March SAN FRANCISCO State regulators yesterday approved the biggest rate increase in California history for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electri c and Southern California Edison but Gov Gray Davis said the increase is premature The governor appearing to soften his longstanding opposition said he wou ld support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate increase is necessary for the good of the state The Public Utilities Commission controlled by Davis appointees voted for an immediate rate increase A statement from Davis who usually demands that appointees reflect his policy did not say whether he would ask the PU C or the Legislature for a rollback if he concludes the increase is unneeded Developments in Californias power crisis Congressman eyes nuclear vessels as source of power Bush calls California energy crisis ominous Rate hike means new political heat for California governor He can ask said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary That is one of many options But now we are waiting for the numbers to plug in the data an d see if a rate increase is necessary The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for a rate increase SDGE has a debt of million but has been paying all of its bills unlike PGE and Edison Those companies say they have debt of billion SDGE is in a different situation because its rates were capped by legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt allowing the utility to borrow The bills of SDGE customers soared last summer when the utility became the first to be deregulated Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PGE we would hope they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of cents p er kilowatt hour said Ed Van Herik a SDGE spokesman Consumer groups warned that outofstate generators who have been ordered by FERC to make some rebates for overcharging will make even more money under the rate increase Some are urging Davis to seize California power plants owned by the generators These people are war criminals said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco The PUC meeting which occurred on a day when the state was hit by a Stage alert because of reduced imports from the Northwest was interrupted by shouts from demonstrators who want a stateowned power system They chanted Public power now we wont pay and Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica which is threatening to put a public power initiative on the ballot next year said some attorneys think the abrupt rate increase can be challenged in court Assemblyman Rod Pacheco RRiverside announced that he will introduce legislation to repeal the rate increase He said a decision should be made not by appointees but by elected officials who are accountable to the publi c Democratic legislative leaders who have large majorities in both houses said Monday that they have reluctantly concluded a rate increase is necessary Davis is scheduled to meet with Assembly Democrats this afternoo n The rate increase approved for PGE and Edison yesterday is cents per kilowatt hour The PUC president Loretta Lynch said media reports of the increase amounting to a percent rise are inaccurate Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about percent if applied across the board She bases her figure on the total bill that includes electricity transmission distribution and other costs The medias characterization of the rate increase as percent is based on only the cost of electricity not the total bill The electricity costs before the increase were cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and cen ts for PGE SDGEs rate is cents Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed tha t the state which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in midJanuary will have to spend more than expected A state plan to lower costs through longterm contracts will fall short this summer The state has been spending about billion a month to buy power The PU C also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly bill collected by utilities which will be used to finance a bond of billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected befor e summer when heat drives up the demand for electricity A number of small generators that provide a quarter of the states power are not operating because they have not been paid by utilities The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PGE to begin paying the small generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of natural gas at the Oregon border rather than at the Southern California border with Arizona Prices at the Arizona border have been percent higher David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association which represents small generators said many of the small plants in Southern California will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the Arizona border Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate Fogarty warned Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal qualifying facilities program since November PGE has been paying them only about percent The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the billion they owe to the small generators Jan SmutnyJones of the Independent Energy Producers said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they ca n pay their debts Many of the small generators produce power from renewable sources such as solar wind geothermal and biomass But most of the small generators use natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompt ed by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation Davis aides told reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of Lynchs proposal until Sunday night They said the governor was briefed Monday morning and that he did not urge his PUC appointees to delay the increase An Edison official said the utili ty received the proposal late Monday morning and had little time to prepare fo r a hasty PUC hearing on the increase that afternoon The two commissioners appointed by former Gov Pete Wilson Richard Bilas a nd Henry Duque said they have been urging a rate increase But both complaine d of the short notice and the lack of time to

nuclear vessels as source of power By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March WASHINGTON As California braces for more blackouts this summer a key House Republican has floated a plan that includes mobilizing a federal disaster agency waiving some environmental regulations and exploring wheth er nuclear reactors aboard Navy ships could be connected to the power grid Several Democrats immediately attacked the plan for not including electrici ty price controls sought by Gov Gray Davis and other California officials Th ey also charged that it would undermine clean air laws The point plan was drafted by Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the House Commerce Committees energy and air quality subcommittee Copies were obtained by Copley News Service Samantha Jordan a spokeswoman for Barton confirmed that he had circulated some proposals for responding to the Western power crisis among subcommitte e members late last week Some of the ideas were deleted before the list was forwarded to the White House Jordan added but she would not say which one s Barton has presided over several hearings on the power crunch and has said that he is more than prepared to draft legislation to help California A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is also developing a national energy policy President Bush has repeatedly stated his opposition to caps on wholesale power prices He has called for a concerted effort to increase energy production The list of ideas Barton sent to subcommittee members was aimed at boosting power generation and transmission in the West increasing conservation and preparing for blackouts Some of the production and transmission measures called for quickly expandi ng a crucial power conduit in the Central Valley known as Path using feder al funds for all or part of the project allowing small power generators to se ll electricity to buyers other than the states cashstrapped utilities and establishing standards for allowing businesses with onsite electricity generation to send surplus supplies to the power grid Other steps sure to be unpopular with environmentalists could be taken if a state declares an electricity emergency In addition to the idea of harnessing the energy from nuclearpowered Navy ships and submarines they include temporarily waiving nitrogen oxide emission limits at power plants allowing the construction of generating plants on federal and Indian lands restarting mothballed nuclear reactors and delaying for a year a plan to divert water in Californias Trinity River from power generation to environmental restoration On the conservation side Barton proposed allowing states to lengthen daylight savings time and requiring federal facilities to reduce energy use by percent Finally the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be directed to open an office in California conduct an educational campaign to prepare the public for blackouts and have a plan ready to provide assistance during power outages Barton has been skeptical of the idea of having the federal government limi t the cost of wholesale power in the West and did not include that among his proposals Instead he said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should investigate whether wholesale prices are unjust and unreasonable a finding FERC already has made once That drew the criticism of four California Democrats Reps Henry Waxman of Los Angeles Anna Eshoo of Atherton Jane Harman of Torrance and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara who sit on the House Commerce Committee They sent a letter to Barton on Friday spelling out their objections Hes left off the ton gorilla solution which is directing the FERC to impose a reasonable cap on the price of wholesale electricity Harma n said The Democrats also said that Bartons proposals would undermine the Clean Air Act and that there is widespread agreement among those directly involved in Californias electricity system that clean air rules are not responsible for electricity shortages Bush calls California energy crisis ominous But he foresees no quick relief opposes controls By George E Condon Jr COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March KALAMAZOO Mich President Bush yesterday made his most extensive remark s yet on the energy crisis in California calling the situation ominous and proclaiming that the time to act is now Despite that pledge though he held out little hope of any speedy relief f or the hardhit state He also restated his opposition to energy price control s The president who has previously addressed the energy crunch only in answe rs to reporters questions used a state of the economy speech to a business group at Western Michigan University to elaborate on his stillevolving energy policy He broke no new ground in his remarks but seemed to be reacting to West Coast criticism that the federal government should be more aggressive in finding a solution to the rolling blackouts plaguing the nations most populous state The energy problem wasnt created overnight and we wont solve the problem overnight he said But we will at least start down the right road so tha t the shortages we face today will not recur year after year He said a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney will come up with a longterm strategy but he ruled out any move by his administration that would remedy the crisis quickly Well not solve the energy problem by running the energy market from out o f Washington DC he said We will solve the energy problem by freeing th e creativity of the American people to find new sources of energy and to develop the new technologies that use energy better more efficiently and more cleanly He singled out for criticism any call that Washington cap energy prices This administration does not and will not support energy price controls he said to applause from the businessoriented audience Price controls do not increase supply and they do not encourage conservation Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s And the United States will not repeat the mistake again He portrayed the energy crisis as a clear threat to his hopes of revitalizi ng the national economy And he signaled that he understands Californians are facing hardships The lights are dimming in California Consumers and businesses in Californ ia are paying sharply higher energy bills And as we compare our future energy needs to the currently projected domestic energy supply we see an ominous growing gap he said He said the blame for the problem belongs to previous decisionmakers Our people are paying a high price for years of neglect And the time to a ct is now he said Meanwhile Bush said he would nominate utility regulators from Texas and Pennsylvania to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC the agency that has played a pivotal role in the California crisis However Bush stopped short of replacing the chairman of the commission Curtis Hebert who has drawn fire from Gov Gray Davis and other California officials for his outspoken faith in open power markets and staunch opposition to federal controls on the soaring price of wholesale power sold in the West There was widespread speculation that Hebert a Republican was on his way out as chairman A White House spokeswoman would not say whether Bush has ruled out naming another commissioner to the top job at a later date Bush nominated Patrick Henry Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell to round out t he fivemember commission Wood is chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was an adviser to Bush on energy issues during the presidential transition Many observers ha d expected Bush to name him chairman of FERC Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Both nominees who face Senate confirmation were praised by power industry officials and consumer groups They have helped steer deregulation plans in their states that are thought to be on sounder footing than Californias failed experiment Rate hike means new political heat for California governor By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS March SACRAMENTO Rolling blackouts and a record increase in electricity rate s are putting the political squeeze on Gov Gray Davis just as he prepares for hi s reelection campaign The Democratic governor took a hit Tuesday when the Public Utilities Commission three of its five members appointed by Davis approved the very rate hikes he has repeatedly said would not be needed The power crunch is just the weakness political foes are looking for it could leave everyone from business owners to consumers looking for someone to blame at the polls next year Hes the face of the problem right now and so he is going to be the target said Nancy Snow a political scientist at the University of California Los Angeles Davis already has been criticized as having a leadership style that is a little bit too much in the mushy middleoftheroad area Snow said Thats something that he is going to have to overcome in order to politically survive this crisis California Republicans blame the firstterm governor for four widespread power outages this year that they call Grayouts His first major challenger in GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones is making energy a campaign centerpiece A top state financial official and fellow Democrat Controller Kathleen Connell says Davis decision to buy power for Southern California Edison a nd Pacific Gas and Electric is putting the state in financial danger And Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling about Davis handling of t he crisis as consumer groups threaten a revolt on the ballot With up to million Californians affected by the rate hikes consumer activists hope to attract millions of rebels to the polls The PUC voted unanimously to immediately raise rates up to percent for Edison and PGE customers saying that would reduce power use this summer a nd help keep the cashstarved utilities in business The increases which come on top of alreadyapproved hikes of to percent and a percent increase planned next year are the biggest in state history Davis issued a written statement Tuesday easing his ardent opposition to a rate hike While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Davis aides are frantically trying to deflect criticism surrounding the increase and assure voters the governor is working to build more power plan ts and boost conservation to avert blackouts during the hot summer months Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor opposes a rate increase bu t has no power to order the PUC to maintain current rates They are an independent body they can do what they want Maviglio said He insisted the governor wasnt informed of PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynchs plan to announce a rate increase Monday declaring to reporters Its not a story its the truth Still some Republicans and Democrats have said the governor has been inconsistent about his pull with the commission He announced last week at a dinner with state labor leaders that he had directed the PUC to order utilities to start paying overdue bills to facilities that produce renewable energy In addition Davis administration officials informed several key Assembly members Friday that the states powerbuying for Edison and PGE could cost far more than the billion lawmakers and Davis estimated when they approved legislation authorizing the power purchases making a rate increas e of percent or more necessary He is fully dedicated to solving this thing he doesnt just want to lay i t on the lap of a ratepayer or a taxpayer and hes trying to come up with wa ys to do that Maviglio said The national attention the power problems draw is raising Davis name recognition around the country for better or worse as he consider s whether to make a presidential run in Davis has been making the rounds on the national TV news and Sunday morning talk shows to explain to the nation why the lights have been going out in California He has attempted to shield himself by continually commenting that he inherited the energy problems thenRepublican Gov Pete Wilson signed the utility deregulation bill largely blamed for the crisis and Californi a went years with no new power plants Davis says Republicans turn the criticism back at him The state GOP has already run radio ads criticizing Davis handling of the power problems and are launchi ng an allout effort to blame him for the rate increases Its a colossal failure of mismanagement on the part of the governors PUC said Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge But even with the energy crisis Republicans have their work cut out for th em in The state GOP long shackled by infighting between moderates and conservatives is in the minority in the Legislature holds just one statewide office Jones and must come up with millions to match the nearl y million Davis had raised nearly two years before the election And polls have shown residents growing increasingly frustrated with the energy crisis but not blaming Davis Those surveys were taken before Tuesdays rate hike and before California was hit last week with rolling blackouts from San Diego to the Oregon border The governors political campaign isnt taking any chances moving quickly to bite back at critics Garry South Davis chief political adviser issued a statement Tuesday saying Jones has failed to put forth his own solution Put your megawatts where your mouth is South said PUC Approves Largest Electricity Rate Increase in States History Regulation Some customers will pay up to more Commissioners facing strong opposition before their unanimous vote say they are trying to avert blackouts Critics say move wont solve the crisis By NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writers PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Richard Bilas show strain of t he meeting at which the panel announced a rate hike We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said ROBERT DURELL Los Angeles Times SAN FRANCISCOWith protesters jeering their disapproval besieged utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the states history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights on for millions of customers The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an increase of cents per kilowatthour That will boost rates by as much as for some Southern California Edison customers and up to for some served by Pacific Gas Electric Co The rate increase which will cost customers nearly billion a year takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at lea st May The rate hike is the most farreaching and politically volatile action the state has taken thus far to ease an monthold power crisis that has nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts But critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale electricity prices The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that are unjust and unreasonable said commission President Loretta Lynch We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on I believe that adding another cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state Department of Water Resources for the nearly billion in power it has purchased for them since midJanuary The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to operate The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by loss of power from such companies But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU C headquarters And the drama of the voteand the vocal oppositionspurred each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action These are extraordinary moments in Californias history declared Commissioner Geoffrey Brown a recent appointee of Gov Gray Davis And extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage Loretta Lynch has take n a lot of bad hits But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in California Rate Increase Lacked Support Lynch proposed the rate increase even though an administrative law judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUCs o wn consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates opposed it She also did not have the public support of Davis who appointed her and two other commissioners Davis has distanced himself from the PUCs action saying the commissi on was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa se is necessary Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilaswho were appointed by Republican Gov Pete Wilsoncalled the rate hikes long overdue Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this summer we have to start paying our power bills Duque said It cannot be done with the current rates Saying there is just no blood left in the turnip Bilas warned that absent an immediate rate increase the utilities will be in Bankruptcy Court Before the vote signcarrying protesters chanted Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay And the commission heard a parade of witnesses most opposing the rate increase Some called on the state to use eminent domain to seize power plants as Davis said he might do as a last resort Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San ta Monica told the commission Go to these power pirates and tell them the state treasury is not their money orchard Barbara George of Womens Energy Matters said We should give the generators hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave Geor ge was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting At a hearing Monday representatives of agriculture and manufacturing industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the California economy The rate hike is the states largest according to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which researched the issue Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly utility bill the overall effect will be about a increase in monthly bills said PUC staff Before the PUC action homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid cents per kilowatthour for electricity and another cents per kilowatthour for other services The new rate totaling cents per kilowatthour boosts the overall bill by about The increase is about for PGE residential customers But under Lynchs proposal those increases would not be applied equally To encourage conservation she seeks a tiered system that would charge miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the new higher rates on bigger users The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use or more beyond a socalled baseline amount which is about half of the average residential use per month and varies by region Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by the PUC in hearings over the next month Under Lynchs proposal nearly hal f of all residential customers would be spared rate increases Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation but they disagree about how much Davis energy advisor S David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said utilities have long used tiered rates when charging lowincome customers So this is not brand new Its just a more aggressive use of it he said UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates would do much to stave off blackouts The greatest conservation gains come from investment in efficient appliances he said and thats why tiered rat es are no magic bullet The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the earliest said Paul Clanon chief of the PUCs energy division The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t he new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated retroactively and charged to future bills Clanon said Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at the question of whether the rate hike will be enough Have we gotten the number right Duque said I dont know I hope w e have But this is a step in the right direction and well return any money not used to buy power Bruce Foster a Southern California Edison vice president also said t he rate increase is a step in the right direction Only time will tell he said if it is sufficient to meet the need In a statement PGE welcomed the PUC action as a dose of realism b ut said the commission left unresolved a host of issues including how much money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for PGE customers The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional billion annually from the million people served by Edison and PGE But that amount doesnt go far in todays California wholesale electricity market The state and utilities spent billion in January buying electricity The state through the Department of Water Resources has spen t nearly billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the utilities since Jan because power generators refused to sell to the cashstrapped utilities Money utilities collect from their customers even with the new rate hike is expected to cover a wide array of expenses including payments on billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spri ng to cover the states cost of buying power The numbers dont add up said Jason Zeller an attorney with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates Massive additional rate increases are my concern We are sticking a finger in the dike unless wholesale prices come down Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to th is story With Energy Crisis Far From Over Experts Say More Hikes Possible Power PUC action leaves questions unanswered such as how to handle utilities debts whether to buy grid By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers As painful as Tuesdays electricity rate increase will be for some consumers power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and threatened its economy Because of that still more rate hikes are possible they say Consumer advocates power company officials legislators and regulator s disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the states problems But th ey agree that Californias energy woes are dizzyingly complex And the rate hi ke makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem Is it over Heavens no said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg DLos Angeles who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power supply issues Its a necessary step but were certainly not out of the woods yet The increase along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC did resolve two major issueshow the state will continue to buy electricit y that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how electricity consumers will repay Californias treasury for those purchases But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions what to do with the roughly billion in debt the states two biggest utility companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power whether the state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own where to find about billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative energy many of whom have not been paid in months and how to wrap up negotiations to sign longterm contracts with generators to supply power in years to come Said PUC President Loretta Lynch Until we can get wholesale prices under control and get folks to conserve were going to be in this pickle f or a while Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was crucial because the state is spending million to million a day to b uy electricity To cover those costs the state is supposed to float bonds which would be repaid from electricity bills But without the higher rates officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments And without the bonds all state taxpayersand not just customers of the priva te utilitieswould be on the hook for the debt In addition to raising rates the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula th at will determine the size of the bond issue expected to be the largest of it s kind in US history The formula allows for billion in bonds The states three major private utilities Southern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and S an Diego Gas Electric will have to determine how much power the state is buying for themthe figure is roughly and use a proportionate amount of the money they collect from customers to pay the state back A billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimate s that pegged it at billion But even the larger number is far less than some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state is buying Unless prices are stabilized state Treasurer Phil Angelides and other s have warned further bond issues may be needed Those in turn could requi re more rate increases Its possible that with the rate increase and if we do a good job wi th conservation its possible that the bonds may be less said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray Its also possible that given the situati on this summer where we have not been able to secure anything close to our power needs we could be paying significantly more The rate increase which kicks in only for customers who use significantly more power than a baseline amount is intended to ease the situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demandforcing energy hogs to switch off spa pumps or pay the price as Lynch put it But no one can predict how the hogs will respond or whether the rate hikeplus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the completion of several new power plants this summerwill be enough to spare the state from forced outages Tuesday did little to fuel optimism Despite temperatures far milder than on a typical summer day another Stage energy alert was declared by the states Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply The state avoided blackouts but it was really close a CalISO spokeswoman said Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months with no outages but private forecasters see at least hours of blackouts And Reliant Energy one of the power plant owners predicts hours of blackouts in the state this year Beyond the problems of supply the state has still not resolved the question of the utilities debt Edison and PGE say theyve lost nearly billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices that the states deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an additional billion in revenue annually most of that will go to paying off bonds and other expenses None is earmarked to relieve the utilities debt When you do the math the amount of money just doesnt get you very far said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the picture Gov Gray Davis wants the state to pay billion for the lines PGE and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills and become creditworthy once more But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogge d down Meanwhile support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be slipping Republicans have long been opposed but now support among Democra ts is waning Keeley a critic of the transmission purchase all along believes that the state should instead buy the utilities hydroelectric generators contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the dams Were just going to sink dough into that transmission system Keel ey said adding that the grid needs an estimated billion in repairs The hydro system by contrast would be a revenueproducing asset that could he lp lower rates he said A related questionstill unresolvedis the fate of the states nearl y producers of alternative and renewable energy which supply more than a quarter of the electricity used by California consumers In a separate acti on Tuesday the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producerswhose megawatts are desperately needed and who in many instances have not been paid since November On Tuesday the small producers delivered a little more than half of their usual supplies to the utilitiesa trend that has dragged on for several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts Producers welcomed the PUCs order that they start getting paid But they said the move failed to address back payments estimated at billion owed by Edison and PGE Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Thir d World countries than they do in the state of California griped Marty Quin n executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which owns three small gasfired generators Any move to resolve that issue of course would increase the debt owe d by the utilities On another front state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal longterm electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the volatile spot market So far only contracts have been signed in part because generators are reluctant to commit to lower prices while theyre still owed billions o f dollars by the nearbankrupt utilities Experts say the power secured by th e current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need th is summer Despite all the unsettled questions at least one utility analyst Dan Ford of the Lehman Bros investment firm said the PUCs actions should remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the California cloud over electricity generators But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall Street Standard Poors said it would continue to carry a cautionary cred it rating for the state The rating agency which placed California on a credit watch after t he state government began spending millions to purchase electricity said in a news release that it was not clear whether the rate hike would be enough Hovering in the background meanwhile is the threat of a ballot initiative that could unravel whatever solutions state officials ultimately craft Leaders of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights have vowe d that any utility bailout would likely trigger a voter revolt The rate increase certainly makes an initiative more likely the foundations lobbyist Doug

SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis convinced that he cant win votes by delivering bad news avoided the task of telling Californians what virtuall y all experts have been saying for monthsthat electricity bills are going u p Indeed on Tuesday the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance himself from a rate hike of as much as that was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission led by his appointee Loretta Lynch That and other recent moves have thrown Davis credibility into questioneven in his own Democratic Party If youre the governor said political consultant Darry Sragow you dont want to take the blame for a massive rate increase that is not going to sit well with a lot of voters You want to be in a position where you can say I didnt have a choice my back was against the wall Davis describes his view of the situation as optimistic He has call ed it an energy challenge not a crisis even as the states two largest utilities border on bankruptcy and the state experienced blackouts a week ago in midMarch when electricity use was less than it will be in the summer when demand is highest Davis and his aides say the governor is fully engaged in the problem understands its many dimensions and is working long hours to solve it But the crisis wears on and an increasing number of lawmakers including fello w Democrats are alarmed Its an energy crisis not an energy challenge said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who began warning of a coming energy shortage months ago This is a major crisis Sen Don Perata DAlameda said and it would appear he is overwhelmed by it If you dont face reality said Sen John Vasconcellos DSanta Clara you cant possibly improve it His posture has been baffling I lament what is going on This is my beloved state and were in serious peril and it scares me Many academics utility executives Wall Street analysts and legislato rs concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary given the soaring wholesale price of electricity Even Davis has acknowledged that a rate hike might solve the situation Believe me Davis said Feb if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes But in a reaction that added to lawmakers bewilderment Davis said in a statement Tuesday that the PUC action was premature because we do not have all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision Until we do the statement continued I cannot support any rate increase In taking steps to raise rates Lynch may well end up taking substanti al flak for her governor Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state Sragow said Gray Davis is still popular Voters clearly dont see a connection between the governor and the PUC Davis aides say the governor didnt talk to Lynch before she acted Lynch a frequent visitor to the Capitol was in Sacramento late last week and again Tuesday She may not have spoken to Davis but she did make other top administration officials aware of her plans Lynch could have decided to act on her own The state Constitution giv es the commission authority to raise utility rates But the governor is well known as a micromanager involved in the most minute details of state governance Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to thi nk like I think and not to act on their own As recently as last week Davis directed that the PUC take specific actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid Davis has said the Legislatures job is to implement his vision He ha s said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should resign His appointees should not be free agents So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch wou ld move to raise rates Tuesday particularly given events that occurred late last week On Friday Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy one of h is top aides met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors At the meeting a participant warned that rates might have to rise to Also Friday a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis staff was convinced that a rate hike was necessary even as Davis continued to public ly oppose it On Sunday a top Davis

various issues for decades is like many others raising questions about the governors credibility his penchant for secrecy and his competence Something is wrong Snyder said Either he is over his depth or it is hubris or it is the great river in Egypt Denial Here are some of the governors statements and actions since called into question Davis held a news conference Feb to say he had reached an agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a deal to buy its massive transmission system for billion A final package he said would be announced within a week not only with Edison bu t with San Diego Gas and Electric A month later a top utility executive described the talks as dreadfully slow Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas Electric which he said back in February would be completed by now are eve n further behind Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with independent generators to buy power He said however that the contracts accounted for to megawatts of electricity this summer a significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy muc h of its power on the far more costly spot market Last week when he released some scant details in a report on the contracts experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market Davis brushed aside reporters questions last week about the blackou ts that rolled across the state He remained cloistered as the outages continu ed for a second day emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensu re that alternative energy producers would be paid A week after he called on lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid the legislation remains stalled It is inept at all levels and doesnt encourage any confidence that h e can handle it Snyder said Moreover it doesnt encourage us that he is going to tell the truth The energy crisis is perilous for Davis reelection effort next year But the governors strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes could be to his benefit when he faces voters Ethically said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain not bei ng forthcoming is worse Politically the more he can obfuscate the more like ly it is some people will buy the obfuscation The reason we see obfuscation is that obfuscation works Not all politicians follow that maxim Davis predecessor Republican Gov Pete Wilson held a news conferenc e in as California plunged into a recession to announce that he was pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history calling it necessary to help erase a billion deficit Top advisors had urged him t o leave the delivery of such bad news to others Any time you deliver bad news to voters youre taking a risk said D an Schnur who was Wilsons spokesman But it is a much bigger risk to allow a situation to fester without preparing voters for decisions that have to be made Nobody likes pain Schnur said But they are much more willing to tolerate it if they understand why it is necessary Federal Energy Agency Unlikely to Order Refunds Power Regulatory panel says much of the overcharge alleged by CalISO is beyond its jurisdiction and questions whether the rest is excessive By MEGAN GARVEY and RICHARD SIMON Times Staff Writers WASHINGTONWhat are the chances that federal regulators will order electricity wholesalers to refund billion in alleged overcharges Zero Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have already made clear that nearly billionalmost half the total that Californias grid operator said last week was excessiveis off the table because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place before Oct beyond their reach As for the rest lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observe rs note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority t o enforce fair and reasonable rates because of difficulty in defining that phrase Some within FERC question how much of the excessive rates documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERCs jurisdictionfor example rates charged by municipal power suppliers that are not regulated by the federal agency So far FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund only million in alleged overchargesjust of the amount that the CalISO has identified That sum deals only with rates charged in January a nd February during Stage alertsperiods when electricity reserves fall below FERCs approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably no t become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon have President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill vacancies on the fivemember commission the White House announced Tuesday The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III chairman of the Texas Utility Commission and a Bush ally and Nora Mead Brownell a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to the FERC governing board Administration officials have indicated that Wood would assume th e FERC chairmanship a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr a staunch advoca te of energy deregulation ShakeUp at FERC Was Expected The shakeup has been expected because of continuing complaints that FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West Hebert in particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity sales Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California s plight replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Sena te Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss CalISO officialswho pointed out that their billion figure was part of a study calling for stronger market controls not for refundsmay still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and Februar y FERC ordered wholesalers to justify million worth of charges shortly after CalISO asked for million in refunds for December and January FERCs refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulato rs who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of supply and demand At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to date in California as well as future rates And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophie s of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it What role should the governmentspecifically FERC an agency with a mandate to ensur e fair and reasonable ratesplay The whole notion that theres such a thing as a just price is kind of an anachronism from New Deal days said Pietro Nivola a Brookings Institu te scholar who studies regulatory politics Especially as we move closer to some form of deregulation weve come to understand that the price is what the traffic will bear In this case utilities simply have to be able to ge t higher rates at the retail end But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority allowing the wholesalers to operate with impunity The message FERC has sent so far is as long as you leave cents of every dollar in the bank we wont pull the alarm said Mark Cooper direct or of research for the Consumer Federation of America Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERCwhile highly unlikelywould go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices But FERC officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm than good potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market already too tight The memory of the s oil crisis and a prevalent view among economists that government intervention made matters worse has inform ed the views of some longtime government officials and observers Refunds Called Inferior Remedy A clear sign of FERCs reluctance to call for refunds came late last year when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for t he California price increases FERC officials said at the time Refunds may b e an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental soluti on to any problems occurring in California markets The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Sta ge alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month by some lawmakers and utility company officials They complained that the narr ow focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers believed were outrageous But even the million questioned by FERC has been defended by the wholesale companies In briefs filed with the agency last week they said rates exceeding per megawatthourcompared with a precrisis average of per megawatthourwere justified by the increased credit risk wholesalers took in selling to nearbankrupt utilities that have billions o f dollars in outstanding debts Duke Energy which FERC has said overcharged California by million signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price company president Ji m Donnell said this week If we are not assured payment the credit premiums are obviously appropriate and we would reserve our right to collect the entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order Both of Bushs Republican nominees to the commission are expected to w in Senate confirmation But they can expect a grilling from Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif who has accused power suppliers of pricegouging and FERC of doing little to stop it Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether theyre going to be responsive to the present situation Feinstein said Tuesday grousing that the administration has been recalcitrant to the point of arrogance Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney head of a White House energy task force but she described the meeting as disappointing Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the California crisis and adding a handwritten note The West needs your hel p A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners would have a more sympathetic ear for the concerns of the Western states But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to price controls Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s and the United States will not repeat the mistake again he said in a spee ch in Kalamazoo Mich The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn The grou p expressed confidence that they would be strong proponents of completing th e muchneeded transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all across the country Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment Wood said in a statement On our best day as regulators we cannot deliver benefits to customers as well as a functional market can But the market must work righ t first Wednesday March A Painful Step Electricity rate increase may help but Gov Davis is yet to offer an understandable plan to end the crisis By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users the state Publi c Utilities Commission finally has recognized the grim reality of the electricity market in California even if Gov Gray Davis has not Electricity costs more these days even aside from the piratical rates charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency The increase while probably necessary will not by itself solve the crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer The two biggest private utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric still are saddled with as much as billion in debt for past power purchases State government still is shelling out some million in daily power purchases and has committed as much as billion to future power contracts Davis continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities share of the state powe r transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities debts Despite all the handwringing and armwaving nothing that state government has done since January has provided any significant new power generation or conservation Consumers are right to wonder what happened to a promised statewide conservation campaign After first ducking the power problem Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year most of them still works in progress But he still has not given the people an understandable coherent plan for getting out of this fix Worse he refuse s even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future The irony of Tuesdays rate increase is that the state might have dodg ed much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago But Davis seekin g reelection next year insisted that the crisis be solved within the existi ng rate structure Late last week he attended a political fundraiser at a Pa lm Springs golf club while his staff was being briefed on the need for higher rates literally distancing himself from the act The rate increase which will be drafted over the next days affect s customers of Edison and PGE but not residents of Los Angeles or other citi es with full municipal power systems The stated intent is that bigger users particularly businesses will pay higher rates and be encouraged to save major amounts of power during the summer Under one scenario nearly half o f householdslow and medium userswould pay no more than they do now The boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the states daily power purchases although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet the full cost The increase should be structured to give ratepayers some relief if lawsuits against power generators exorbitant pricing are successful in winning refunds Those skeptical ratepayers who believe that the crisis is just a big ripoff by the utilities and the energy companies will consider the increas e more of the same You cant blame them considering the lack of straight ta lk from the governor including his dodging of the rate issue However most state experts including Davis own utilities commissioners say the rate increase is a critical first step in solving Californias power problems If Davis has a plan to fix the problem some other way he should present it in detail to the people of California now PUC Votes To Jack Up Power Rates Tiered increases approved as protests disrupt meeting David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL The bill finally came due for Californias experiment with electricity deregulation as consumers were hit yesterday with the largest rate increase in state history an average percent jump in monthly power costs The immediate rate hike was unanimously approved by the Public Utilities Commission during a rowdy meeting that was repeatedly interrupted by chanti ng and jeers from protesters Highway Patrol officers were directed by PUC President Loretta Lynch to remove several demonstrators from the packed San Francisco auditorium These are extraordinary moments in Californias history and extraordinary moments demand extraordinary courage PUC member Geoffrey Brown said befor e the rate increase was passed The commissioners approved a new percent increase and made permanent a temporary percent increase adopted in January This will allow the states two largest utilities to charge customers an extra billion a year PUC members said higher rates will help overcome the wide disparity between skyrocketing costs charged by power companies for electricity and the relatively low amount paid by consumers under Californias deregulatio n law However consumers bills will not go up until a tiered rate system can b e introduced requiring those who use more power to pay higher fees That system is expected to be in place by May Gov Gray Davis who has tried to distance himself from the PUCs move sinc e it was unveiled Monday said in a statement yesterday that the rate increas e was premature and that he did not support the decision While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity he said Several PUC members acknowledged that such a huge rate increase might not have been necessary had the commission acted sooner to remedy Californias power woes We should have done this in January Brown said but we didnt have enou gh information This rate increase is long overdue said Richard Bilas who also sits on the commission We are finally transfusing some blood CONSUMERS PROTEST If so the donor ratepayers did not go willingly to the operating theater A number of citizens rose to speak at yesterdays meeting and not one was in favor of higher power rates This is being shoved down the peoples throats said Dorothy Diez an elderly San Francisco resident Why dont they put the bills where they belong and not on my back She and others called on state officials to take a harder line with outof state power generators which have reaped windfall profits by charging sky high wholesale prices for their electricity Consumer groups urged the PUC to support special taxes on the generators earnings or even seizure of the companies California power plants Your actions are reprehensible Ross Mirkarimi a publicpower supporter told the commission Do not do Gov Davis dirty work The governor did not attend yesterdays meeting but his presence nonethele ss loomed large over the proceedings Consumer advocates derided Davis claims this week that he played no role i n the decision to raise rates They noted that the governors appointees hold a majority on the PUC and worked closely with Davis on a variety of past issues Davis staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its decision DAVIS CONTROLS PUC Gov Davis controls the PUC said Doug Heller assistant organizing director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights He is responsible for the rate hike We are paying more because of the failure of his leadership It seems absurd that Gov Davis is saying his own agency is acting without his consent said Susannah Churchill head of energy policy for the California Public Interest Research Group Hes just looking for political cover The PUC decision was made on a day when Californias grid operators declare d a Stage alert the first in a week indicating that power reserves had dropped below percent When tiered rates are implemented customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co will see rates go up between percent for medium power users and percent for heavy users Those who can keep power consumption to within percent of pre established limits will see no increase beyond the percent rate hike adopted in January Customers of Southern California Edison will see rates increase between a nd percent Bruce Foster an Edison vice president called the rate increase a step in the right direction but said further increases may be needed to defray soaring power costs this summer PGE spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the PUCs decision more closely before determining whether a percent rate hi ke will be sufficient The PUC has done all it can said Lynch the PUC president We have foug ht back hard in every venue possible against unjust energy prices NO FEDERAL HELP In the end though she said state regulators were forced to admit that no help would be forthcoming from federal authorities in capping wholesale pow er rates and that generators would continue exploiting Californias chronic electricity shortage We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said Along the same lines the PUC approved a requirement that PGE and Edison repay the state Department of Water Resources for about billion in power purchases made on the cashstrapped utilities behalf The commission also passed a motion forcing PGE and Edison to pay smaller power generators for their output Half of all such generators were shut do wn during last weeks blackouts because they had not been paid by the utilitie s However the PUC is only requiring that utilities pay for future electricit y purchases and did not address the millions of dollars in payments still ow ed the power companies Ann MacLeod executive director of the California Cogeneration Council an association of smaller generators said that by avoiding the question of ba ck debt the PUCs move will do nothing to restore plants to operation These generators will not come back online as a result of this decision she said In fact a greater number likely will have to drop offline Protesters chanting Hell no we wont pay urged consumers after the PUC meeting to not include the higher fees in upcoming bills This is just the beginning said Medea Benjamin who was among the demonstrators evicted from

little urgency to change the overwhelming wastefulness of our built environment During the past two decades weve done plenty of sparing at the spigot and that can only be applauded Weve passed minimal building energy standards such as Californias Title but then wiped out much of the savings by building the sort of needlessly bloated energyguzzling homes that now sprawl across acre after acre of on

months of waiting for the states elected leaders to act California s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest electricity rate increase in at least two decades and offered no assurance s that more hikes wont be needed soon The cent per kilowatthour increase would boost average rates for all customers by percent although the precise residential and business rate s have yet to be determined It is effective immediately and will show up on bills in May The commissions vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political backdrop Gov Gray Davis who appointed three of its five members said he wasnt consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it But Davis after learning Sunday night about the plan apparently did not seek to block the commissions action Instead he issued a statement immediately after the vote that called it premature because we do not hav e all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Until w e do I cannot support any rate increase The commission however said it had no alternative but to raise rates considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billion s in taxpayer funds on power because its cashstrapped utilities are no longe r creditworthy But even some commissioners were uneasy Davis most recent appointee on th e commission Geoffrey Brown acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that we as commissioners had very little time to review this In fact an administrative law judge using much the same evidence that w as included in the decision to raise rates had concluded recently that no such increase was justified The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of cents pe r kilowatthour Previously officials with Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison had only sought a cent per kilowatthour increase Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain whether a cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormou s cost the state has incurred since it began buying power The state still doesnt know how much its effort to bail out PGE and Ediso n which involves a state purchase of the utilities highvoltage lines will cost Its also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on t he expensive electricity spot market this summer and whether an additional ra te increase would be needed to cover that Have we got the number right asked Commissioner Henry Duque in reference to the cent increase I dont know But I hope we have Roderick Wright DLos Angeles who chairs the

bear By establishing a cent increase now well be back in a short time potentially doing it again he said To be nickeled and dimed to death as were doing here I dont think that does anybody any good Signs of confusion Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused While providing a welcome dose of realism PGE president Gordon Smith said in a prepared statement the rate hike and other actions taken by the commission Tuesday do not offer a comprehensive solution fail to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability Among PGEs major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated fo r their debts which they claim total about billion and whether PGE or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spo t market Bruce Foster an Edison vice president offered a similar lukewarm endorsement of the increase Im not saying that it will do it he said acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road but he calle d the hike a step in the right direction Rate hike vs bankruptcy Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced into bankruptcy the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger rate hikes to stabilize the companies finances A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one design ed by a bankruptcy judge Bilas said adding that he also was concerned abou t how the state appeared to be buying electricity like a drunken sailor But others reacted angrily to the commissions decision Several protesters hoisted signs at the meeting that read we wont pay and chanted rat e hikes go away make the energy companies pay Police later escorted them out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed at their noisy interruptions Instead of raising rates they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to use the states power of eminent domain to take over the power plants operated by companies accused of gouging the public The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing by the rules of society said Mike Florio senior attorney with The Utili ty Reform Network in San Francisco Theyre economic war criminals Officials in Davis office said Tuesday that they intend to review the commissions action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support i t or seek changes But to some people the governors claim of ignorance abou t the commissions plan and his seeming inability to do anything to stop t he rate hike from being approved severely strained credulity Give me a break said Sen John Vasconcellos DSan Jose Who appoint ed them and whos been giving orders all along Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consid er having consumers pay more for electricity If it becomes clear that a rat e increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state he said I will support one that is fair Dion Nissenbaum and Hallye Jordan contributed to this report Impact of increases will vary greatly Posted at pm PST Tuesday March BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News The rate increases approved Tuesday will hit Californians in very different ways The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most and nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all Although the details arent yet final state regulators say they intend to fashion a tiered structure to implement the higher rates Heres how th e proposal will affect your bill When do the higher rates kick in Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it wont appear on bills until May While regulators agreed that rates will rise th ey still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost Hearings are expected next month Once the structure is approved regulator s say utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesdays rate approval Do the new rates affect all Californians No The Public Utilities Commission which approved the rate increase has authority over only investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric which together ser ve about million homes and businesses The increase affects PGE and Edison but not San Diego Municipal utilities including Santa Clara Palo Alto Alameda Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt How will the new rates work Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial a nd powerguzzling residential customers pay a greater share Residential customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their baseline amount What is the baseline The baseline is considered the average household usage It was established years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electrici ty usage over that amount Does everybody have the same baseline No Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in electricity needs caused by regional climate household type and season How many baselines are there PGE residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among three climatic baseline territories the coastal areas including San Francisco and the Peninsula the East Bay and South Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains Within those territories there are separate baselines for singlefamily homes and multifamily apartment complexes as well as for homes with only electric appliances instead of both gas and electric In addition baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage Summe r rates begin May and winter rates begin Nov How do I find out my baseline Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatthours and the rate you are billed for that amount It also shows how much power you used over the baseline and the rate you were billed for it How does the baseline affect my bill Customers already pay about percent more for power they use over their baseline Under the proposed tiered rates PGE customers who use no more than percent of their baseline amount wouldnt pay any more than they d o now PGE customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average percent increase in monthly bills Those who use more than twice their baseline would see an average increase of percent Edison customers woul d have similar rates Almost half of the utilities customers dont exceed percent of their baseline Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase The increase can be calculated many ways The commission approved an increa se of cents a kilowatthour three times the cent surcharge approved in January which was made permanent Tuesday Because the cent increase averaged percent some have said that plus the cents amounts to a percent increase Others have added cents to the amount the utilities charge just for electricity which for PGE is now cents and come up with a percent increase Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges others have added cents to the average total rate of cents for all customers a percent increase Under the tiered proposal the average residential rate would rise percent from cents to cents But average bills for residents bills would increase up to percent depending on electricity use Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesnt apply to commercial and industrial businesses In fact the proposal calls for a proportionately greater increase for businesses which pay lower rates than residential customers Commercial customers would see a percent increase Industrial customers generally over kilowatthours a month would see a percent increase But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power Go v Gray Davis this month ordered percent rebates for all customers who redu ce electricity usage percent over last year between June and September Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on percent reduction of total consumption while commercial and industrial rebates wil l be based on percent reduction of peak load If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now will I have to pay more Possibly The

voted unanimously Tuesday to approve electricity rate increases of as high as percent for customers of Californias two largest power utilities The rate increases for Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison Co which take effect immediately are the largest in California history totaling billion a year PUC commissioners said the increases were necessary to head off blackouts this summer and to keep the cashstarved utilities from going under The PUC simultaneously ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers and to p ay producers of renewable energy for future supplies Commission President Loretta Lynch said the PUC had tried to avoid rate increases but saw no other option The commission voted to boost rates by cents a kilowatthour PGE rates would rise by as much as percent and Edison rates by as much as percent Not all PGE and Edison customers will face higher bills The PUC said it would

Naturalgasdependent alternative generators say that even if the major utilities begin paying them for energy it wont be enough cash State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to start paying alternativeenergy producers per megawatthour But alternative generators that use natural gas say thats at least below what it costs to produce the energy On the short run we cant generate said David Lloyd of NRG Energy Inc which this month shut down its megawatt plant in the Bay area that sel ls steam to the CH sugar factory next door It just costs so much for electricity Alternative generators have been paid little or nothing the past four months and are now collectively owed more than billion by the utilities The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or sh ut down their plants resulting in a megawatt loss to California enoug h to power million homes That was a factor in blackouts last week and th e states Stage energy alert Tuesday There are two classes of alternative generators renewables which use sola r wind or cleanburning technologies to produce energy and cogenerators which use natural gas to produce energy but share the heat output with a manufacturer Renewables which make up half of the alternativeener gy megawatts say theyre likely to continue producing but would like to be pa id what theyve been owed the past four months PUC spokeswoman Kyle Devine said per megawatthour should work for generators if the natural gas is transported through an Oregon pipeline a cheaper route rather than through a pipeline from the Southwest But a gas proposal that Ken Ross of Delta Energy Co in Santa Ana received Tuesday showed the transportation price to be just as expensive Bush to nominate who favor free markets for energy panel March By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON President George W Bush will nominate two new federal energy regulators whose history indicates that like him they favor free markets and dont favor price controls Bush said Tuesday that he will ask the Senate to confirm Patrick Wood chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and Nora Mead Brownell a commissioner with the Pennsylvania PUC to the fivemember Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Both Republican nominees have presided over the deregulation of their state s energy markets so far with more success than California Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif who sits on the Energy and Natural Resourc es Committee which will hold hearings on the FERC appointees issued an early warning Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether they would be responsive t o the present situation Feinstein said Up to this point the administration has been recalcitrant to the point of arrogance If that is the case with these new appointees as well they wont have my vote However neither is expected to have trouble getting confirmation Wood PUC chairman since has said Texas deregulation climate is different from Californias Unlike California the Texas deregulation encourages longterm contracts Texas has more power reserves and its easier to get a permit to build a plant there Brownell has been on the Pennsylvania PUC since Pennsylvanias market also differs greatly from Californias in several way s The state is a net exporter of power while California is an importer and Pennsylvanias deregulation plan did not force utilities to sell their plants Davis backs power rate hikes if necessary He says PUC approval of hikes Tuesday is premature SP is unsure how conservation will affect revenue March By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate hikes saying he would support them if it becomes clear it is absolutely necessary for the good of the state The governors statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities Commission a panel controlled by Davis appointees endorsed a plan to rai se monthly bills by as much percent The increase eventually would be tied to a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more medium users those who conserve energy will pay moderately more and heavy users will pay a lot more Details of the plan are not yet set Davis called the PUCs decision premature saying scant information was available to justify increases While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear a rate increase i s absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Boosting electricity rates to help resolve Californias energy crisis is likely to increase the states billion revenue bond sale to billion or more entailing more interest charges and a longer payback Standard and Poors the Wall Street creditrating agency called the ratin g plan a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of electricity It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected and whether revenue s will slip under the rateraising formula as consumers respond by conserving electricity SP said Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided The state which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities says it has first rights to the money The utilities have challenged that California hopes to borrow billion by selling revenue bonds in May to cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December Through April those costs are expected to total billion The bond money also will be used to pay for power under longterm contracts which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used Critics have questioned whether billion will be sufficient PUC Preside nt Loretta Lynch said the increased rates would support at least a billion bond sale Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio and Joseph Fichera a Davis fisca l adviser declined to discuss a specific amount Cheney says states on its own March By DENA BUNIS The Orange County Register WASHINGTON Sen Dianne Feinstein says Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday offered no hope of federal help for Californias electricity crisis and sh e is once again appealing to the president to meet with her It was very disappointing Feinstein said in an interview after a minute meeting Cheney had with a group of senators I practically begged for a period of reliability and stability so we could get through th e summer and I didnt get any feeling back that there was going to be any help Cheney insisted Feinstein said that California has to straighten itself out and was not moved by the fact that the Public Utility Commission was poised to increase rates nearly percent After the meeting Feinstein sent President George W Bush a twopage lette r Your administration has not yet offered any constructive solution to this problem she wrote If the federal government continues to ignore the situation the result may very well be economic disaster for millions of small businesses and residents Feinstein wrote a final plea that Bush meet with her and Sen Gordon Smith ROre who is cosponsoring a bill authorizing shortterm regional price caps Bush on Tuesday reiterated his position against price caps in a speech in Michigan Feinstein has heard little sympathy for her state from colleagues who have repeatedly said Californians have not felt any real pain Rep Jennifer Dun n RWash recently complained that Californians were turning on their hot tu bs without worrying about paying higher costs Feinstein said such criticism is exaggerated But she said she hopes the ra te increase approved by the PUC will show critics the state is doing the righ t thing Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif who said she was not invited to meet with Cheney said she was concerned that the rate increase would be making consumers bear the brunt of the electricity crisis Before a rate increase is considered Boxer said the PUC should make sure average residential consumers and small businesses are protected and take whatever legal action is available against those generating companies who colluded and unlawfully manipulated prices We should get something in return some assets Boxer added also calling on the utilities to contribute some of the money they diverted to their parent

Orange County Register The states power crisis hit your wallet Tuesday when state regulators hike d electricity rates as much as percent Your bill could be headed up as a result Here are answers to some of your questions about the rate hike Q How much more will I pay A Details of the plan havent been finalized But the idea is to create a threelevel rate structure Those who use more electricity will pay the highest rates and those who conserve will save Consumers who use less than l percent of their baseline power allocation will escape any increase We explain baseline below The rate increase will be distributed across the two higher tiers The Publ ic Utilities Commission over the next days will come up with a plan to determine exact rates for the two higher levels as well as for different types of customers such as residential and small business Q So what is baseline A Baseline is the portion of your usage considered necessary for essential s To encourage conservation its set below the amount most people use The percentage of Edison customers who use less than percent of baselin e is roughly percent in winter months and percent in the summer Because baseline is set based on the average households use it means a single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a homeowner with four children Baseline varies depending on where you live Warmer areas get higher baselines There are different baselines for the summer and winter People who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocation s Allelectric homes get higher baselines Q Whats the reason for this rate hike Are they really doing this to get people to conserve A Conservation is a side benefit The primary motivation is money The state has already shelled out billion buying power in the last three months for customers of the nearinsolvent utilities The state plans to issue bonds which will be paid for by consumers to cov er the power purchases But Wall Street bankers must have proof of a steady revenue stream a rate increase to convince them the bonds can be repaid However people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their power so the plan will also help reduce demand Q Im already conserving How can I cut my bill further A Its nittygritty time Replace your incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs Clean those coils at the back of your refrigerator Turn your air conditioner down or off Reduce the amount of time you use your po ol pump Many items in your house use electricity when they are plugged in even if theyre not in use You can cut consumption by unplugging your television computer coffeepot toaster and blow dryer Q When will I pay the increase A The rate hike takes effect immediately But it could take Southern California Edison a month to days to implement it so you could face retroactive charges on a followup bill Q I live in south Orange County and buy electricity from San Diego Gas Electric Co Does this plan affect me A No SDGE has applied for a rate increase but state regulators have not yet voted on that request Q Im outraged We didnt ask for deregulation and now were paying more How can I protest A Call or write you state lawmakers and the governor You can also join on e of the consumer groups fighting the rate hike such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights It is at The Utility Reform Network is at National Desk Section A RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA By EVELYN NIEVES The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAN FRANCISCO March Californias power regulators approved the large st utility rate increases in state history today in an effort to avert more rolling blackouts and keep the states principal electricity producers from collapsing in bankruptcy Despite Gov Gray Daviss repeated statements that no new rate increases would be needed to keep the states two largest utilities solvent the Stat e Public Utilities Commission said today that it had no choice but to raise rates by up to percent for customers of the two utilities to avoid a greater catastrophe if the companies went bankrupt We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices said Loretta Lynch the commission president and a Davis appointee who had proposed the increases on Monday Ms Lynch said that under a tiered rate system that would be hammered out within the next days heavy power users would face the greatest increase s while light users would face little or no increases Customers will see the rate increases in their May utility bills Perhaps percent of consumers under this system including the poorest residents who would be exempt will face no increase at all Ms Lynch said Heavy users will face increases of about percent she said Coupled with the average percent temporary rate increase in January that the commission made permanent today those consumers will pay percent mo re for utilities than they did in December But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates increase could feel the impact if commercial power customers from small businesses to megastores pass on their higher electricity costs through price increases Before the rate increases power costs in California were slightly higher than the national average but lower than the prices paid in New York and other Northeastern States Residential electricity users already pay an average of about a month state officials say In addition under a previous commission decision rates will go up an additional percent nex t year The commission which approved the rate increase to also voted to require that the two large utilities the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison reimburse the states Department of Water Resources billion spent on their behalf and begin paying alternative energy generators which account for more than a quarter of the states dai ly energy needs The two utilities have not paid their bills for months sayin g they are nearly bankrupt because under deregulation of the power industry wholesalers have been allowed to float prices while retail rates were cappe d The Department of Water Resources has spent million a day since January buying power on the utilities behalf Small alternative energy producers h ad not been paid at all for months with dire consequences For two days last week the states power managers were forced to order rolling blackouts across parts of the state in part because the small energy producers shut down half their capacity because they had not been paid The rate increases will make the payoff more feasible Ms Lynch said whil e encouraging energy conservation But a representative of the states alternativeenergy generators known as qualifying facilities complained that the commission did nothing to address the roughly billion the utilities owed producers Im not sure what our options are at this point if the state wants the qualified facilities to be a part of the solution said David Fogarty a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association and alternativeener gy cogenerators representing about alternativeenergy producers in California For those on all sides the commission seemed to raise as many questions as it answered Consumer advocates who interrupted the hearing five times questioned why the commission had decided on the vote so abruptly with onl y hour notice to the public Spokesmen for each of the utility companies said they had no idea what the rate increases would mean to the average customer until the tiered system was determined They also said they did no t know whether these new rates would mean the end of rolling blackouts They may know something that I dont know said Bruce Foster vice president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison speaking of the commissions vote outside the hearing room Mr Foster also complained that the commissions directive to begin paying bills to the state and the alternative energy producers or face a penalt y equal to the amount owed might be illegal and said that the company woul d look into appealing it Ron Low a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric also complained that the commissions actions seemed rushed and lacked specifics The rate increase will generate about billion a year for Pacific Gas a nd Electric unit of PGE and billion for Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International While those revenues will help the utilities buy power on the wholesale market in the future the commission made no provision for paying off about billion in debt accumulated by the utilities as a result of past wholesale costs That issue would be left to the governor and state legislators The commission heard public comment before the vote but did not answer questions afterward Consumer advocates were furious many blaming Governor Davis The governor today issued a statement calling the commissions move premature From the beginning Ive said that my main goal was to solve this problem while protecting the consumer from undue rate hikes Mr Dav is said The PUCs action today was premature because we do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Mr Daviss statement seemed to reflect the awareness he and his aides feel about the potential political backlash from big rate increases Even as oth er politicians warned that such increases would be necessary Mr Davis has vowed to avoid them On Monday he insisted that he had not spoken to any members of the commission about the rate increase proposal and that he had no control over its actions But Mr Davis appointed three of the bodys five members and since taking office two years ago he has been emphatic in saying that he expects his appointees to state boards and commissions to reflect his policies He also did not hesitate to complain that he could not control the previous members of the commission because they were Republican appointees and his aides acknowledged that top gubernatorial advisers had consulted with Ms Lynch and approved her plans Politicians in both parties said Mr Davis was trying to shift blame for an y rate increase to the commission while claiming that increases were approved over his objections They predicted that that effort could backfire by maki ng Mr

protesters jeered Hell no we wont pay California regulators approved electricity rate increases of up to perce nt Tuesday to head off blackouts this summer and keep the states two biggest utilities from going under The increases approved by the Public Utilities Commission are the biggest in California history and take effect immediately for the millio n people served by Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Ediso n Co The PUC has done all it can commission president Loretta Lynch said We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices The PUC also ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers Just how much wasnt known the state has not disclosed how much it has spent on various long and shortterm power contracts For the rate increase the commission said it will create a tiered system that will protect poor people and penalize customers who use the most electricity Lynch proposed the higher rates as a way to force electricity hogs to conserve and to help keep SoCal Edison and PGE solvent The plan is also seen as a way to protect Californias budget surplus whic h is being drained of million to million a day as the state buys powe r for the cashstrapped utilities Since the crisis began more than billion in taxpayer money has been spent to keep the lights on SoCal Edison and PGE say they have lost more than billion since last summer because of high wholesale electricity prices and because California s deregulation law prevents the utilities from passing those costs on to their customers Both have urged the PUC to raise rates Following the PUC meeting SoCal Edison said it will begin paying interest to bondholders after weeks of missing payments The rate increase will be on top of the percent to percent hike approv ed by the PUC in January and a percent increase already scheduled for next year Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a ripoff We are being held hostage by a handful of energy companies that under deregulation got control of our electricity supply said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Until our elected officials start acting to protect us we are going to be at their mercy at the mercy of this ripoff Democratic Gov Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that he has no power over the PUC However three of the PUC members are his appointees And his aides have told lawmakers that rates have to rise Residents already pay about per month for electricity cents per kilowatt hour to SoCal Edison and cents per kwh to PGE The latest rate hike would mean a percent increase for SoCal Edison customers and percent for PGE customers for electricity alone Since th e rates are bundled with other fees the average price of a kilowatt hour is closer to cents for SoCal Edison customers and cents for PGE customers Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much th e plan will cost customers because the effects of the tiered system are not known The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters and dismay over the plan was seen elsewhere Sam Sahouria owner of the Fox Plaza Grocery and Deli in San Francisco sai d rate hikes could be too much for his familyrun store to

at for more information IMAGE The most comprehensive uptodate map of the North American Power System b y RDIFT Energy is now available from SCIENTECH IMAGE IssueAlert for March AES Completes Acquisition of IPALCO by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The AES Corporation NYSE AES announced that it has completed its acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises the Indianapolis Indbased utility wit h MW of generation and customers in and around Indianapolis IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange of shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be exchanged for shares of AES common stock IPALCO common stock was suspended from trading at the close of the market on March Analysis The purchase of IPALCO an established and respected utility in t he Midwest will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an d further the companys aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid e of its business AES already owns CILCORP an energy services company whose largest subsidiary CILCO serves portions of Illinois and Missouri Note that pursuant to an SEC order AES will restructure andor sell its ownersh ip interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an exempt holding company under PUHCA Thus through the purchase of IPALCO AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has established In addition from this purchase we now know that AES along wi th being a global player intends to remain dominant throughout the United States as well Further the acquisition represents a rather bright development for AES considering that the company has recently encountered some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California First lets examine the value of AES acquisition of IPALCO Certainly th e MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow Jones Utility Average An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every

Times Wed RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA Individualcom Wed Calif Regulators Raise Power Rates State backs rate hike But increase still may not resolve crisis By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers Published March SAN FRANCISCO Brushing aside the shouts and hisses of outraged protesters state regulators approved a billionayear utility rate hike Tuesday b ut couldnt guarantee that the increases will remedy Californias electricity crisis With activists chanting rate hikes no way and utility executives branding the decision as inadequate the Public Utilities Commission voted to raise rates about percent for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Edison The rate hike took effect immediately but probably wont show up in customer bills until May But while PUC commissioners said they were taking a bold step major holes remain in the states patchwork effort to save the two beleaguered utilitie s and ensure reliable energy supplies during what promises to be a long hot summer The higher rates wont pay off billions in old utility debts leaving PGE and Edison under the continued threat of a bankruptcy filing by power generators bondholders or other creditors The increases will likely curtail energy consumption but its unlikely the cutbacks will be enough to stave off rolling blackouts this summer The PUC put off a crucial decision on how to allocate the rate hikes across custome r categories and the final rate design could determine how much Californians will conserve The vote may not achieve one of its key goals reviving the wind farms cogenerators and other alternativeenergy producers that provide more than percent of Californias electricity Hundreds have shut down in recent weeks because o f nonpayment by PGE and Edison contributing to rolling blackouts March a nd After months of prodding the PUC approved what may well be the largest utility rate increase in Californias history saying it had no choice if i t was to shore up utility finances and lessen the risk of blackouts It raise d rates just under percent in addition to making permanent a percent surcharge approved in January The increased revenue will go to pay for the state Department of Water Resources power purchases on the utilities behalf and to alternativeenergy producers that supply a major chunk of the utilities power The PUCs move could make utility bankruptcies more palatable to state officials because it ensures payment for future power supplies Now if we have a bankruptcy a lot of bad things will probably happen but theres le ss risk to the general public of mass power disruptions said state Sen Debr a Bowen DMarina del Rey chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee PGE arguing that the PUC didnt go nearly far enough said it will demand the panel reconsider Todays actions while providing a welcome dose of realism in the ene rgy policy debate unfortunately do not resolve any of the key issues facing Californias policymakers PGE President Gordon Smith said Smith said the decision could worsen Californias energy problems by forcin g the utilities to pay the state Department of Water Resources which is buyi ng power on the utilities behalf ahead of other creditors An Edison vice president Bruce Foster said the rate increase is a step i n the right direction but added Only time will tell if its enough The company announced it will start making interest payments on defaulted bond and bank debts Edison and PGE both criticized the commission for sharply lowering the PUC s estimates of the utilities debts PUC commissioners acknowledged they have more work to do to resolve Californias energy mess and some hinted that additional rate hikes may b e in the offing Have we gotten the number right I dont know said Commissioner Henry Duque But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the billion will be enough to pay Californias ongoing power bills Meanwhile Gov Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Davis said Until we do I cannot support any rate increase While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increa se is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis approval three of it s members are Davis appointees and last Friday his aides shared data with business lobbyists indicating rates would rise substantially said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers Technology Association Consumer advocates blasted rate increases as a surrender to the power generators that control much of Californias electricity Noting that the states grid operator has accused the generators of overcharging Californians by billion they urged the PUC to focus its firepower on those robber barons on steroids as Berkeley activist Barbar a George put it Its like dealing with the mob said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights Instead of breaking our fingers theyre goi ng to turn the lights out again Jamming the PUCs auditorium to near capacity activists said the state should seize the generators power plants They razzed the commissioners wi th taunts of blood money and its a sham prompting guards to escort some protesters out PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters saying the generators are the real culprits in our energy crisis But she said the commission had to approve rate hikes The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power generators to refund some of their profits Lynch said the rate hikes would be refunded to customers if generators are forced to surrender money The higher rates will generate billion in additional yearly revenue f or Edison and billion for PGE according to PUC estimates But with most of the money going to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources for current and future power purchases the PUC action doesnt repay the billions the utilities owe to generators and other creditors You still have billion maybe more of costs that havent been paid fo r and thats still a problem said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Tradin g Forum an association of power generators I dont believe creditors are going to be infinitely patient The two utilities have defaulted on billions of debts and face a daily thre at of bankruptcy Thats still an issue that ultimately has to be addressed said Senior Vi ce President John Stout of Reliant Energy Inc a generator thats owed million Davis is negotiating to buy the transmission grid from Edison PGE and San Diego Gas Electric Co as a means of paying off the utilities existing debts But Bowen the Energy Committee chair said she doubts the deal will go through Beyond complaining the PUC didnt solve the existingdebt issue the utilities were dismayed by a change in PUC accounting that sharply lowers estimates of their debts and could have major impacts on how much control regulators keep over their operations for months to come Even though rates keep going up a state ordered rate

action Edison calle d it illegal The board voted to raise rates cents a kilowatthour and make permanent a cent increase approved in January Documents from Lynchs office said rat es would rise on average percent but Lynch later described it as percen t The PUC put off a decision on how the higher rates will affect each custome r category other than to say its leaning toward a system that will charge more for electricity consumed above a certain threshold The PUC estimated that percent of residential ratepayers those who use less than that threshold will see no rise at all Lynch proposed some businesses would s ee rate hikes of as much as percent How much conservation will this get us It will depend very much on how it s designed said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute The rate hikes wont affect customers of municipal utilities such as Sacramento Municipal Utility District SMUD is planning a percent rate hike The PUC vote may do little to help the hundreds of alternativeenergy producers known as qualifying facilities many of which have shut down fo r nonpayment The PUC on Tuesday ordered PGE and Edison to start paying these producers in April but some of the producers say the PUCs new pricing mechanism doesn t get them back on their feet financially Many following the lead of one Imperial Valley producer may choose to sever their contracts with the two utilities and sell their power elsewhere even out of state This is not a solution cogenerators lawyer Jerry Bloom said of the PUC vote It will drive additional plants off the system

wont necessarily lead to a recession said Brad Williams senior economist at the state Legislative Analysts Office What were really talking about is less economic growth Williams said Some households will feel this and it will pinch their budgets and affect how much income they have for purchasing goods and services The state estimates that spending on electricity last year averaged between and percent of both business production costs and household budgets Some business owners and economists welcomed the boost in electricity rates saying in the long run they will spur energy conservation

impossible for us to pass these costs on said Jeff Boese of the Californi a League of Food Processors If we dont get a handle on energy costs very quickly I would suspect a significant number of food

March For all the talk of electricity rates going up across the state theres a way every resident of California can avoid the price hit altogether Just u se electricity sparingly A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesda y does not affect households that use less than percent of a baseline amount of power Fortyfive percent of households already stay within that limit according to PUC President Loretta Lynch The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas and Electrics territory percent utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUCapprov ed increase but is planning to raise rates this spring as well It too proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of kilowatthours used over baseline District rate administrator Alan Wilcox said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back their electricity use How difficult might that be If youre accustomed to using a central air conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat it could be difficult by Wilcoxs reckoning If youre running an airconditioning load in the Valley you could probab ly expect to get into that second tier above baseline a little bit he said There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or have swamp coolers or just go without In SMUD territory the baseline is kilowatthours per month in summer and kwh in winter for most customers Households that do not use gas a nd are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption at least it w as the average when the baseline was set in the early s Consumption has crept up a bit since to kwh a month last year Under SMUDs rateincrease proposal the summertime rate would remain at cents per kilowatthour for the first kwh The price would rise b y cents a kilowatthour for the next kwh used up to kwh Big energy consumers would pay more than cents for each kwh used over kwh Bottom line The biggest users pay the most Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC which will affect PGE customers as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric have yet to be worked out but the rates are expecte d to be structured in a similar tiered fashion Currently PGE customers yeararound pay cents per kilowatthour up t o the baseline limit and cents for every kilowatthour over baseline The average baseline throughout the territory is between and kwh Tabor said it varies from region to region to account for climate Tabor said the PGE baseline amounts to between percent and percent o f the average electricity use per household in a given territory That proportion she said was taken from a Lifeline program in effect from to that was meant to provide a minimum necessary quantity of electrici ty and gas at a lower cost Tabor said percent of PGEs residential customers use only baseline amounts of electricity Bee staff writer Carrie Peyton contributed to this report Regulators prescribe biggest rate increase in state history Davis calls ruling for PGE Edison premature consumer groups push for seizure of plants By Ed Mendel UNIONTRIBUNE STAFF WRITER March SAN FRANCISCO State regulators yesterday approved the biggest rate increase in California history for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electri c and Southern California Edison but Gov Gray Davis said the increase is premature The governor appearing to soften his longstanding opposition said he wou ld support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate increase is necessary for the good of the state The Public Utilities Commission controlled by Davis appointees voted for an immediate rate increase A statement from Davis who usually demands that appointees reflect his policy did not say whether he would ask the PU C or the Legislature for a rollback if he concludes the increase is unneeded Developments in Californias power crisis Congressman eyes nuclear vessels as source of power Bush calls California energy crisis ominous Rate hike means new political heat for California governor He can ask said Steve Maviglio Davis press secretary That is one of many options But now we are waiting for the numbers to plug in the data an d see if a rate increase is necessary The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for a rate increase SDGE has a debt of million but has been paying all of its bills unlike PGE and Edison Those companies say they have debt of billion SDGE is in a different situation because its rates were capped by legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt allowing the utility to borrow The bills of SDGE customers soared last summer when the utility became the first to be deregulated Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PGE we would hope they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of cents p er kilowatt hour said Ed Van Herik a SDGE spokesman Consumer groups warned that outofstate generators who have been ordered by FERC to make some rebates for overcharging will make even more money under the rate increase Some are urging Davis to seize California power plants owned by the generators These people are war criminals said Mike Florio an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco The PUC meeting which occurred on a day when the state was hit by a Stage alert because of reduced imports from the Northwest was interrupted by shouts from demonstrators who want a stateowned power system They chanted Public power now we wont pay and Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica which is threatening to put a public power initiative on the ballot next year said some attorneys think the abrupt rate increase can be challenged in court Assemblyman Rod Pacheco RRiverside announced that he will introduce legislation to repeal the rate increase He said a decision should be made not by appointees but by elected officials who are accountable to the publi c Democratic legislative leaders who have large majorities in both houses said Monday that they have reluctantly concluded a rate increase is necessary Davis is scheduled to meet with Assembly Democrats this afternoo n The rate increase approved for PGE and Edison yesterday is cents per kilowatt hour The PUC president Loretta Lynch said media reports of the increase amounting to a percent rise are inaccurate Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about percent if applied across the board She bases her figure on the total bill that includes electricity transmission distribution and other costs The medias characterization of the rate increase as percent is based on only the cost of electricity not the total bill The electricity costs before the increase were cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and cen ts for PGE SDGEs rate is cents Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed tha t the state which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in midJanuary will have to spend more than expected A state plan to lower costs through longterm contracts will fall short this summer The state has been spending about billion a month to buy power The PU C also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly bill collected by utilities which will be used to finance a bond of billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected befor e summer when heat drives up the demand for electricity A number of small generators that provide a quarter of the states power are not operating because they have not been paid by utilities The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PGE to begin paying the small generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of natural gas at the Oregon border rather than at the Southern California border with Arizona Prices at the Arizona border have been percent higher David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association which represents small generators said many of the small plants in Southern California will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the Arizona border Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate Fogarty warned Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal qualifying facilities program since November PGE has been paying them only about percent The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the billion they owe to the small generators Jan SmutnyJones of the Independent Energy Producers said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they ca n pay their debts Many of the small generators produce power from renewable sources such as solar wind geothermal and biomass But most of the small generators use natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompt ed by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation Davis aides told reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of Lynchs proposal until Sunday night They said the governor was briefed Monday morning and that he did not urge his PUC appointees to delay the increase An Edison official said the utili ty received the proposal late Monday morning and had little time to prepare fo r a hasty PUC hearing on the increase that afternoon The two commissioners appointed by former Gov Pete Wilson Richard Bilas a nd Henry Duque said they have been urging a rate increase But both complaine d of the short notice and the lack of time to study the complex proposals approved yesterday Davis aides said they do not understand how Lynch arrived at an increase of cents per kilowatt hour The governor is waiting for estimates of state pow er purchases this summer available generation the effect of conservation th e potential for federally ordered refunds from generators and other data before he makes a rate decision The Davis appointees on the commission Geoffrey Brown and Carl Wood prais ed Lynch for showing courageous leadership The increase approved yesterday which utility spokesmen said was the large st in their history comes on top of a percent residential increase for Edis on and PGE imposed in January and a scheduled percent increase next March when a rate reduction paid for by a billion bond expires Lynch said the rate increase approved yesterday takes effect immediately bu t will not show up on customer bills until May or later The PUC is working o n a plan to design the increase to encourage conservation giving

nuclear vessels as source of power By Toby Eckert COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March WASHINGTON As California braces for more blackouts this summer a key House Republican has floated a plan that includes mobilizing a federal disaster agency waiving some environmental regulations and exploring wheth er nuclear reactors aboard Navy ships could be connected to the power grid Several Democrats immediately attacked the plan for not including electrici ty price controls sought by Gov Gray Davis and other California officials Th ey also charged that it would undermine clean air laws The point plan was drafted by Rep Joe Barton RTexas chairman of the House Commerce Committees energy and air quality subcommittee Copies were obtained by Copley News Service Samantha Jordan a spokeswoman for Barton confirmed that he had circulated some proposals for responding to the Western power crisis among subcommitte e members late last week Some of the ideas were deleted before the list was forwarded to the White House Jordan added but she would not say which one s Barton has presided over several hearings on the power crunch and has said that he is more than prepared to draft legislation to help California A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is also developing a national energy policy President Bush has repeatedly stated his opposition to caps on wholesale power prices He has called for a concerted effort to increase energy production The list of ideas Barton sent to subcommittee members was aimed at boosting power generation and transmission in the West increasing conservation and preparing for blackouts Some of the production and transmission measures called for quickly expandi ng a crucial power conduit in the Central Valley known as Path using feder al funds for all or part of the project allowing small power generators to se ll electricity to buyers other than the states cashstrapped utilities and establishing standards for allowing businesses with onsite electricity generation to send surplus supplies to the power grid Other steps sure to be unpopular with environmentalists could be taken if a state declares an electricity emergency In addition to the idea of harnessing the energy from nuclearpowered Navy ships and submarines they include temporarily waiving nitrogen oxide emission limits at power plants allowing the construction of generating plants on federal and Indian lands restarting mothballed nuclear reactors and delaying for a year a plan to divert water in Californias Trinity River from power generation to environmental restoration On the conservation side Barton proposed allowing states to lengthen daylight savings time and requiring federal facilities to reduce energy use by percent Finally the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be directed to open an office in California conduct an educational campaign to prepare the public for blackouts and have a plan ready to provide assistance during power outages Barton has been skeptical of the idea of having the federal government limi t the cost of wholesale power in the West and did not include that among his proposals Instead he said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should investigate whether wholesale prices are unjust and unreasonable a finding FERC already has made once That drew the criticism of four California Democrats Reps Henry Waxman of Los Angeles Anna Eshoo of Atherton Jane Harman of Torrance and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara who sit on the House Commerce Committee They sent a letter to Barton on Friday spelling out their objections Hes left off the ton gorilla solution which is directing the FERC to impose a reasonable cap on the price of wholesale electricity Harma n said The Democrats also said that Bartons proposals would undermine the Clean Air Act and that there is widespread agreement among those directly involved in Californias electricity system that clean air rules are not responsible for electricity shortages Bush calls California energy crisis ominous But he foresees no quick relief opposes controls By George E Condon Jr COPLEY NEWS SERVICE March KALAMAZOO Mich President Bush yesterday made his most extensive remark s yet on the energy crisis in California calling the situation ominous and proclaiming that the time to act is now Despite that pledge though he held out little hope of any speedy relief f or the hardhit state He also restated his opposition to energy price control s The president who has previously addressed the energy crunch only in answe rs to reporters questions used a state of the economy speech to a business group at Western Michigan University to elaborate on his stillevolving energy policy He broke no new ground in his remarks but seemed to be reacting to West Coast criticism that the federal government should be more aggressive in finding a solution to the rolling blackouts plaguing the nations most populous state The energy problem wasnt created overnight and we wont solve the problem overnight he said But we will at least start down the right road so tha t the shortages we face today will not recur year after year He said a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney will come up with a longterm strategy but he ruled out any move by his administration that would remedy the crisis quickly Well not solve the energy problem by running the energy market from out o f Washington DC he said We will solve the energy problem by freeing th e creativity of the American people to find new sources of energy and to develop the new technologies that use energy better more efficiently and more cleanly He singled out for criticism any call that Washington cap energy prices This administration does not and will not support energy price controls he said to applause from the businessoriented audience Price controls do not increase supply and they do not encourage conservation Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s And the United States will not repeat the mistake again He portrayed the energy crisis as a clear threat to his hopes of revitalizi ng the national economy And he signaled that he understands Californians are facing hardships The lights are dimming in California Consumers and businesses in Californ ia are paying sharply higher energy bills And as we compare our future energy needs to the currently projected domestic energy supply we see an ominous growing gap he said He said the blame for the problem belongs to previous decisionmakers Our people are paying a high price for years of neglect And the time to a ct is now he said Meanwhile Bush said he would nominate utility regulators from Texas and Pennsylvania to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC the agency that has played a pivotal role in the California crisis However Bush stopped short of replacing the chairman of the commission Curtis Hebert who has drawn fire from Gov Gray Davis and other California officials for his outspoken faith in open power markets and staunch opposition to federal controls on the soaring price of wholesale power sold in the West There was widespread speculation that Hebert a Republican was on his way out as chairman A White House spokeswoman would not say whether Bush has ruled out naming another commissioner to the top job at a later date Bush nominated Patrick Henry Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell to round out t he fivemember commission Wood is chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was an adviser to Bush on energy issues during the presidential transition Many observers ha d expected Bush to name him chairman of FERC Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Both nominees who face Senate confirmation were praised by power industry officials and consumer groups They have helped steer deregulation plans in their states that are thought to be on sounder footing than Californias failed experiment Rate hike means new political heat for California governor By Alexa Haussler ASSOCIATED PRESS March SACRAMENTO Rolling blackouts and a record increase in electricity rate s are putting the political squeeze on Gov Gray Davis just as he prepares for hi s reelection campaign The Democratic governor took a hit Tuesday when the Public Utilities Commission three of its five members appointed by Davis approved the very rate hikes he has repeatedly said would not be needed The power crunch is just the weakness political foes are looking for it could leave everyone from business owners to consumers looking for someone to blame at the polls next year Hes the face of the problem right now and so he is going to be the target said Nancy Snow a political scientist at the University of California Los Angeles Davis already has been criticized as having a leadership style that is a little bit too much in the mushy middleoftheroad area Snow said Thats something that he is going to have to overcome in order to politically survive this crisis California Republicans blame the firstterm governor for four widespread power outages this year that they call Grayouts His first major challenger in GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones is making energy a campaign centerpiece A top state financial official and fellow Democrat Controller Kathleen Connell says Davis decision to buy power for Southern California Edison a nd Pacific Gas and Electric is putting the state in financial danger And Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling about Davis handling of t he crisis as consumer groups threaten a revolt on the ballot With up to million Californians affected by the rate hikes consumer activists hope to attract millions of rebels to the polls The PUC voted unanimously to immediately raise rates up to percent for Edison and PGE customers saying that would reduce power use this summer a nd help keep the cashstarved utilities in business The increases which come on top of alreadyapproved hikes of to percent and a percent increase planned next year are the biggest in state history Davis issued a written statement Tuesday easing his ardent opposition to a rate hike While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Davis aides are frantically trying to deflect criticism surrounding the increase and assure voters the governor is working to build more power plan ts and boost conservation to avert blackouts during the hot summer months Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor opposes a rate increase bu t has no power to order the PUC to maintain current rates They are an independent body they can do what they want Maviglio said He insisted the governor wasnt informed of PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynchs plan to announce a rate increase Monday declaring to reporters Its not a story its the truth Still some Republicans and Democrats have said the governor has been inconsistent about his pull with the commission He announced last week at a dinner with state labor leaders that he had directed the PUC to order utilities to start paying overdue bills to facilities that produce renewable energy In addition Davis administration officials informed several key Assembly members Friday that the states powerbuying for Edison and PGE could cost far more than the billion lawmakers and Davis estimated when they approved legislation authorizing the power purchases making a rate increas e of percent or more necessary He is fully dedicated to solving this thing he doesnt just want to lay i t on the lap of a ratepayer or a taxpayer and hes trying to come up with wa ys to do that Maviglio said The national attention the power problems draw is raising Davis name recognition around the country for better or worse as he consider s whether to make a presidential run in Davis has been making the rounds on the national TV news and Sunday morning talk shows to explain to the nation why the lights have been going out in California He has attempted to shield himself by continually commenting that he inherited the energy problems thenRepublican Gov Pete Wilson signed the utility deregulation bill largely blamed for the crisis and Californi a went years with no new power plants Davis says Republicans turn the criticism back at him The state GOP has already run radio ads criticizing Davis handling of the power problems and are launchi ng an allout effort to blame him for the rate increases Its a colossal failure of mismanagement on the part of the governors PUC said Assemblyman Keith Richman RNorthridge But even with the energy crisis Republicans have their work cut out for th em in The state GOP long shackled by infighting between moderates and conservatives is in the minority in the Legislature holds just one statewide office Jones and must come up with millions to match the nearl y million Davis had raised nearly two years before the election And polls have shown residents growing increasingly frustrated with the energy crisis but not blaming Davis Those surveys were taken before Tuesdays rate hike and before California was hit last week with rolling blackouts from San Diego to the Oregon border The governors political campaign isnt taking any chances moving quickly to bite back at critics Garry South Davis chief political adviser issued a statement Tuesday saying Jones has failed to put forth his own solution Put your megawatts where your mouth is South said PUC Approves Largest Electricity Rate Increase in States History Regulation Some customers will pay up to more Commissioners facing strong opposition before their unanimous vote say they are trying to avert blackouts Critics say move wont solve the crisis By NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN Times Staff Writers PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Richard Bilas show strain of t he meeting at which the panel announced a rate hike We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said ROBERT DURELL Los Angeles Times SAN FRANCISCOWith protesters jeering their disapproval besieged utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the states history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights on for millions of customers The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an increase of cents per kilowatthour That will boost rates by as much as for some Southern California Edison customers and up to for some served by Pacific Gas Electric Co The rate increase which will cost customers nearly billion a year takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at lea st May The rate hike is the most farreaching and politically volatile action the state has taken thus far to ease an monthold power crisis that has nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts But critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale electricity prices The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that are unjust and unreasonable said commission President Loretta Lynch We maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on I believe that adding another cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state Department of Water Resources for the nearly billion in power it has purchased for them since midJanuary The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to operate The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by loss of power from such companies But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU C headquarters And the drama of the voteand the vocal oppositionspurred each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action These are extraordinary moments in Californias history declared Commissioner Geoffrey Brown a recent appointee of Gov Gray Davis And extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage Loretta Lynch has take n a lot of bad hits But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in California Rate Increase Lacked Support Lynch proposed the rate increase even though an administrative law judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUCs o wn consumer protection arm the Office of Ratepayer Advocates opposed it She also did not have the public support of Davis who appointed her and two other commissioners Davis has distanced himself from the PUCs action saying the commissi on was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa se is necessary Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilaswho were appointed by Republican Gov Pete Wilsoncalled the rate hikes long overdue Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this summer we have to start paying our power bills Duque said It cannot be done with the current rates Saying there is just no blood left in the turnip Bilas warned that absent an immediate rate increase the utilities will be in Bankruptcy Court Before the vote signcarrying protesters chanted Rate hikes no way make the energy companies pay And the commission heard a parade of witnesses most opposing the rate increase Some called on the state to use eminent domain to seize power plants as Davis said he might do as a last resort Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San ta Monica told the commission Go to these power pirates and tell them the state treasury is not their money orchard Barbara George of Womens Energy Matters said We should give the generators hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave Geor ge was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting At a hearing Monday representatives of agriculture and manufacturing industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the California economy The rate hike is the states largest according to the Office of Ratepayer Advocates which researched the issue Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly utility bill the overall effect will be about a increase in monthly bills said PUC staff Before the PUC action homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid cents per kilowatthour for electricity and another cents per kilowatthour for other services The new rate totaling cents per kilowatthour boosts the overall bill by about The increase is about for PGE residential customers But under Lynchs proposal those increases would not be applied equally To encourage conservation she seeks a tiered system that would charge miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the new higher rates on bigger users The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use or more beyond a socalled baseline amount which is about half of the average residential use per month and varies by region Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by the PUC in hearings over the next month Under Lynchs proposal nearly hal f of all residential customers would be spared rate increases Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation but they disagree about how much Davis energy advisor S David Freeman general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said utilities have long used tiered rates when charging lowincome customers So this is not brand new Its just a more aggressive use of it he said UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates would do much to stave off blackouts The greatest conservation gains come from investment in efficient appliances he said and thats why tiered rat es are no magic bullet The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the earliest said Paul Clanon chief of the PUCs energy division The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t he new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated retroactively and charged to future bills Clanon said Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at the question of whether the rate hike will be enough Have we gotten the number right Duque said I dont know I hope w e have But this is a step in the right direction and well return any money not used to buy power Bruce Foster a Southern California Edison vice president also said t he rate increase is a step in the right direction Only time will tell he said if it is sufficient to meet the need In a statement PGE welcomed the PUC action as a dose of realism b ut said the commission left unresolved a host of issues including how much money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for PGE customers The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional billion annually from the million people served by Edison and PGE But that amount doesnt go far in todays California wholesale electricity market The state and utilities spent billion in January buying electricity The state through the Department of Water Resources has spen t nearly billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the utilities since Jan because power generators refused to sell to the cashstrapped utilities Money utilities collect from their customers even with the new rate hike is expected to cover a wide array of expenses including payments on billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spri ng to cover the states cost of buying power The numbers dont add up said Jason Zeller an attorney with the Office of Ratepayer Advocates Massive additional rate increases are my concern We are sticking a finger in the dike unless wholesale prices come down Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to th is story With Energy Crisis Far From Over Experts Say More Hikes Possible Power PUC action leaves questions unanswered such as how to handle utilities debts whether to buy grid By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writers As painful as Tuesdays electricity rate increase will be for some consumers power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and threatened its economy Because of that still more rate hikes are possible they say Consumer advocates power company officials legislators and regulator s disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the states problems But th ey agree that Californias energy woes are dizzyingly complex And the rate hi ke makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem Is it over Heavens no said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg DLos Angeles who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power supply issues Its a necessary step but were certainly not out of the woods yet The increase along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC did resolve two major issueshow the state will continue to buy electricit y that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how electricity consumers will repay Californias treasury for those purchases But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions what to do with the roughly billion in debt the states two biggest utility companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power whether the state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own where to find about billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative energy many of whom have not been paid in months and how to wrap up negotiations to sign longterm contracts with generators to supply power in years to come Said PUC President Loretta Lynch Until we can get wholesale prices under control and get folks to conserve were going to be in this pickle f or a while Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was crucial because the state is spending million to million a day to b uy electricity To cover those costs the state is supposed to float bonds which would be repaid from electricity bills But without the higher rates officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments And without the bonds all state taxpayersand not just customers of the priva te utilitieswould be on the hook for the debt In addition to raising rates the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula th at will determine the size of the bond issue expected to be the largest of it s kind in US history The formula allows for billion in bonds The states three major private utilities Southern California Edison Pacific Gas Electric and S an Diego Gas Electric will have to determine how much power the state is buying for themthe figure is roughly and use a proportionate amount of the money they collect from customers to pay the state back A billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimate s that pegged it at billion But even the larger number is far less than some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state is buying Unless prices are stabilized state Treasurer Phil Angelides and other s have warned further bond issues may be needed Those in turn could requi re more rate increases Its possible that with the rate increase and if we do a good job wi th conservation its possible that the bonds may be less said state Sen Debra Bowen DMarina del Ray Its also possible that given the situati on this summer where we have not been able to secure anything close to our power needs we could be paying significantly more The rate increase which kicks in only for customers who use significantly more power than a baseline amount is intended to ease the situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demandforcing energy hogs to switch off spa pumps or pay the price as Lynch put it But no one can predict how the hogs will respond or whether the rate hikeplus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the completion of several new power plants this summerwill be enough to spare the state from forced outages Tuesday did little to fuel optimism Despite temperatures far milder than on a typical summer day another Stage energy alert was declared by the states Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply The state avoided blackouts but it was really close a CalISO spokeswoman said Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months with no outages but private forecasters see at least hours of blackouts And Reliant Energy one of the power plant owners predicts hours of blackouts in the state this year Beyond the problems of supply the state has still not resolved the question of the utilities debt Edison and PGE say theyve lost nearly billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices that the states deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an additional billion in revenue annually most of that will go to paying off bonds and other expenses None is earmarked to relieve the utilities debt When you do the math the amount of money just doesnt get you very far said Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the picture Gov Gray Davis wants the state to pay billion for the lines PGE and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills and become creditworthy once more But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogge d down Meanwhile support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be slipping Republicans have long been opposed but now support among Democra ts is waning Keeley a critic of the transmission purchase all along believes that the state should instead buy the utilities hydroelectric generators contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the dams Were just going to sink dough into that transmission system Keel ey said adding that the grid needs an estimated billion in repairs The hydro system by contrast would be a revenueproducing asset that could he lp lower rates he said A related questionstill unresolvedis the fate of the states nearl y producers of alternative and renewable energy which supply more than a quarter of the electricity used by California consumers In a separate acti on Tuesday the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producerswhose megawatts are desperately needed and who in many instances have not been paid since November On Tuesday the small producers delivered a little more than half of their usual supplies to the utilitiesa trend that has dragged on for several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts Producers welcomed the PUCs order that they start getting paid But they said the move failed to address back payments estimated at billion owed by Edison and PGE Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Thir d World countries than they do in the state of California griped Marty Quin n executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC which owns three small gasfired generators Any move to resolve that issue of course would increase the debt owe d by the utilities On another front state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal longterm electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the volatile spot market So far only contracts have been signed in part because generators are reluctant to commit to lower prices while theyre still owed billions o f dollars by the nearbankrupt utilities Experts say the power secured by th e current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need th is summer Despite all the unsettled questions at least one utility analyst Dan Ford of the Lehman Bros investment firm said the PUCs actions should remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the California cloud over electricity generators But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall Street Standard Poors said it would continue to carry a cautionary cred it rating for the state The rating agency which placed California on a credit watch after t he state government began spending millions to purchase electricity said in a news release that it was not clear whether the rate hike would be enough Hovering in the background meanwhile is the threat of a ballot initiative that could unravel whatever solutions state officials ultimately craft Leaders of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights have vowe d that any utility bailout would likely trigger a voter revolt The rate increase certainly makes an initiative more likely the foundations lobbyist Doug Heller said Tuesday If Gov Davis does not protect the public from profiteers Heller said his group is ready to pu sh forward with an initiative in Times staff writers Virginia Ellis Dan Morain Tim Reiterman Nancy RiveraBrooks Julie Tamaki Nancy Vogel and Rone Tempest contributed to th is story NEWS ANALYSIS Davis Keeps His Distance From Utility Rate Hikes By DAN MORAIN Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis convinced that he cant win votes by delivering bad news avoided the task of telling Californians what virtuall y all experts have been saying for monthsthat electricity bills are going u p Indeed on Tuesday the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance himself from a rate hike of as much as that was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission led by his appointee Loretta Lynch That and other recent moves have thrown Davis credibility into questioneven in his own Democratic Party If youre the governor said political consultant Darry Sragow you dont want to take the blame for a massive rate increase that is not going to sit well with a lot of voters You want to be in a position where you can say I didnt have a choice my back was against the wall Davis describes his view of the situation as optimistic He has call ed it an energy challenge not a crisis even as the states two largest utilities border on bankruptcy and the state experienced blackouts a week ago in midMarch when electricity use was less than it will be in the summer when demand is highest Davis and his aides say the governor is fully engaged in the problem understands its many dimensions and is working long hours to solve it But the crisis wears on and an increasing number of lawmakers including fello w Democrats are alarmed Its an energy crisis not an energy challenge said Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen DMarina del Rey who began warning of a coming energy shortage months ago This is a major crisis Sen Don Perata DAlameda said and it would appear he is overwhelmed by it If you dont face reality said Sen John Vasconcellos DSanta Clara you cant possibly improve it His posture has been baffling I lament what is going on This is my beloved state and were in serious peril and it scares me Many academics utility executives Wall Street analysts and legislato rs concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary given the soaring wholesale price of electricity Even Davis has acknowledged that a rate hike might solve the situation Believe me Davis said Feb if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in minutes But in a reaction that added to lawmakers bewilderment Davis said in a statement Tuesday that the PUC action was premature because we do not have all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision Until we do the statement continued I cannot support any rate increase In taking steps to raise rates Lynch may well end up taking substanti al flak for her governor Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state Sragow said Gray Davis is still popular Voters clearly dont see a connection between the governor and the PUC Davis aides say the governor didnt talk to Lynch before she acted Lynch a frequent visitor to the Capitol was in Sacramento late last week and again Tuesday She may not have spoken to Davis but she did make other top administration officials aware of her plans Lynch could have decided to act on her own The state Constitution giv es the commission authority to raise utility rates But the governor is well known as a micromanager involved in the most minute details of state governance Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to thi nk like I think and not to act on their own As recently as last week Davis directed that the PUC take specific actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid Davis has said the Legislatures job is to implement his vision He ha s said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should resign His appointees should not be free agents So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch wou ld move to raise rates Tuesday particularly given events that occurred late last week On Friday Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy one of h is top aides met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors At the meeting a participant warned that rates might have to rise to Also Friday a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis staff was convinced that a rate hike was necessary even as Davis continued to public ly oppose it On Sunday a top Davis aide referred reporters to Lynch who confirmed that she would move to raise rates Tuesday Two months ago Harry Snyder of Consumers Union was defending Davis Now Snyder who has worked with Davis on various issues for decades is like many others raising questions about the governors credibility his penchant for secrecy and his competence Something is wrong Snyder said Either he is over his depth or it is hubris or it is the great river in Egypt Denial Here are some of the governors statements and actions since called into question Davis held a news conference Feb to say he had reached an agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a deal to buy its massive transmission system for billion A final package he said would be announced within a week not only with Edison bu t with San Diego Gas and Electric A month later a top utility executive described the talks as dreadfully slow Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas Electric which he said back in February would be completed by now are eve n further behind Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with independent generators to buy power He said however that the contracts accounted for to megawatts of electricity this summer a significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy muc h of its power on the far more costly spot market Last week when he released some scant details in a report on the contracts experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market Davis brushed aside reporters questions last week about the blackou ts that rolled across the state He remained cloistered as the outages continu ed for a second day emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensu re that alternative energy producers would be paid A week after he called on lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid the legislation remains stalled It is inept at all levels and doesnt encourage any confidence that h e can handle it Snyder said Moreover it doesnt encourage us that he is going to tell the truth The energy crisis is perilous for Davis reelection effort next year But the governors strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes could be to his benefit when he faces voters Ethically said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain not bei ng forthcoming is worse Politically the more he can obfuscate the more like ly it is some people will buy the obfuscation The reason we see obfuscation is that obfuscation works Not all politicians follow that maxim Davis predecessor Republican Gov Pete Wilson held a news conferenc e in as California plunged into a recession to announce that he was pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history calling it necessary to help erase a billion deficit Top advisors had urged him t o leave the delivery of such bad news to others Any time you deliver bad news to voters youre taking a risk said D an Schnur who was Wilsons spokesman But it is a much bigger risk to allow a situation to fester without preparing voters for decisions that have to be made Nobody likes pain Schnur said But they are much more willing to tolerate it if they understand why it is necessary Federal Energy Agency Unlikely to Order Refunds Power Regulatory panel says much of the overcharge alleged by CalISO is beyond its jurisdiction and questions whether the rest is excessive By MEGAN GARVEY and RICHARD SIMON Times Staff Writers WASHINGTONWhat are the chances that federal regulators will order electricity wholesalers to refund billion in alleged overcharges Zero Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have already made clear that nearly billionalmost half the total that Californias grid operator said last week was excessiveis off the table because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place before Oct beyond their reach As for the rest lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observe rs note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority t o enforce fair and reasonable rates because of difficulty in defining that phrase Some within FERC question how much of the excessive rates documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERCs jurisdictionfor example rates charged by municipal power suppliers that are not regulated by the federal agency So far FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund only million in alleged overchargesjust of the amount that the CalISO has identified That sum deals only with rates charged in January a nd February during Stage alertsperiods when electricity reserves fall below FERCs approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably no t become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon have President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill vacancies on the fivemember commission the White House announced Tuesday The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III chairman of the Texas Utility Commission and a Bush ally and Nora Mead Brownell a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to the FERC governing board Administration officials have indicated that Wood would assume th e FERC chairmanship a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr a staunch advoca te of energy deregulation ShakeUp at FERC Was Expected The shakeup has been expected because of continuing complaints that FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West Hebert in particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity sales Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California s plight replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Sena te Majority Leader Trent Lott RMiss CalISO officialswho pointed out that their billion figure was part of a study calling for stronger market controls not for refundsmay still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and Februar y FERC ordered wholesalers to justify million worth of charges shortly after CalISO asked for million in refunds for December and January FERCs refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulato rs who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of supply and demand At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to date in California as well as future rates And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophie s of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it What role should the governmentspecifically FERC an agency with a mandate to ensur e fair and reasonable ratesplay The whole notion that theres such a thing as a just price is kind of an anachronism from New Deal days said Pietro Nivola a Brookings Institu te scholar who studies regulatory politics Especially as we move closer to some form of deregulation weve come to understand that the price is what the traffic will bear In this case utilities simply have to be able to ge t higher rates at the retail end But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority allowing the wholesalers to operate with impunity The message FERC has sent so far is as long as you leave cents of every dollar in the bank we wont pull the alarm said Mark Cooper direct or of research for the Consumer Federation of America Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERCwhile highly unlikelywould go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices But FERC officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm than good potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market already too tight The memory of the s oil crisis and a prevalent view among economists that government intervention made matters worse has inform ed the views of some longtime government officials and observers Refunds Called Inferior Remedy A clear sign of FERCs reluctance to call for refunds came late last year when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for t he California price increases FERC officials said at the time Refunds may b e an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental soluti on to any problems occurring in California markets The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Sta ge alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month by some lawmakers and utility company officials They complained that the narr ow focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers believed were outrageous But even the million questioned by FERC has been defended by the wholesale companies In briefs filed with the agency last week they said rates exceeding per megawatthourcompared with a precrisis average of per megawatthourwere justified by the increased credit risk wholesalers took in selling to nearbankrupt utilities that have billions o f dollars in outstanding debts Duke Energy which FERC has said overcharged California by million signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price company president Ji m Donnell said this week If we are not assured payment the credit premiums are obviously appropriate and we would reserve our right to collect the entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order Both of Bushs Republican nominees to the commission are expected to w in Senate confirmation But they can expect a grilling from Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif who has accused power suppliers of pricegouging and FERC of doing little to stop it Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether theyre going to be responsive to the present situation Feinstein said Tuesday grousing that the administration has been recalcitrant to the point of arrogance Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney head of a White House energy task force but she described the meeting as disappointing Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the California crisis and adding a handwritten note The West needs your hel p A spokesman for Gov Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners would have a more sympathetic ear for the concerns of the Western states But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to price controls Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the s and the United States will not repeat the mistake again he said in a spee ch in Kalamazoo Mich The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn The grou p expressed confidence that they would be strong proponents of completing th e muchneeded transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all across the country Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment Wood said in a statement On our best day as regulators we cannot deliver benefits to customers as well as a functional market can But the market must work righ t first Wednesday March A Painful Step Electricity rate increase may help but Gov Davis is yet to offer an understandable plan to end the crisis By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users the state Publi c Utilities Commission finally has recognized the grim reality of the electricity market in California even if Gov Gray Davis has not Electricity costs more these days even aside from the piratical rates charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency The increase while probably necessary will not by itself solve the crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer The two biggest private utilities Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric still are saddled with as much as billion in debt for past power purchases State government still is shelling out some million in daily power purchases and has committed as much as billion to future power contracts Davis continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities share of the state powe r transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities debts Despite all the handwringing and armwaving nothing that state government has done since January has provided any significant new power generation or conservation Consumers are right to wonder what happened to a promised statewide conservation campaign After first ducking the power problem Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year most of them still works in progress But he still has not given the people an understandable coherent plan for getting out of this fix Worse he refuse s even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future The irony of Tuesdays rate increase is that the state might have dodg ed much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago But Davis seekin g reelection next year insisted that the crisis be solved within the existi ng rate structure Late last week he attended a political fundraiser at a Pa lm Springs golf club while his staff was being briefed on the need for higher rates literally distancing himself from the act The rate increase which will be drafted over the next days affect s customers of Edison and PGE but not residents of Los Angeles or other citi es with full municipal power systems The stated intent is that bigger users particularly businesses will pay higher rates and be encouraged to save major amounts of power during the summer Under one scenario nearly half o f householdslow and medium userswould pay no more than they do now The boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the states daily power purchases although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet the full cost The increase should be structured to give ratepayers some relief if lawsuits against power generators exorbitant pricing are successful in winning refunds Those skeptical ratepayers who believe that the crisis is just a big ripoff by the utilities and the energy companies will consider the increas e more of the same You cant blame them considering the lack of straight ta lk from the governor including his dodging of the rate issue However most state experts including Davis own utilities commissioners say the rate increase is a critical first step in solving Californias power problems If Davis has a plan to fix the problem some other way he should present it in detail to the people of California now PUC Votes To Jack Up Power Rates Tiered increases approved as protests disrupt meeting David Lazarus Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday March San Francisco Chronicle URL cgibinarticlecgifileDchroniclearchive M NDTL The bill finally came due for Californias experiment with electricity deregulation as consumers were hit yesterday with the largest rate increase in state history an average percent jump in monthly power costs The immediate rate hike was unanimously approved by the Public Utilities Commission during a rowdy meeting that was repeatedly interrupted by chanti ng and jeers from protesters Highway Patrol officers were directed by PUC President Loretta Lynch to remove several demonstrators from the packed San Francisco auditorium These are extraordinary moments in Californias history and extraordinary moments demand extraordinary courage PUC member Geoffrey Brown said befor e the rate increase was passed The commissioners approved a new percent increase and made permanent a temporary percent increase adopted in January This will allow the states two largest utilities to charge customers an extra billion a year PUC members said higher rates will help overcome the wide disparity between skyrocketing costs charged by power companies for electricity and the relatively low amount paid by consumers under Californias deregulatio n law However consumers bills will not go up until a tiered rate system can b e introduced requiring those who use more power to pay higher fees That system is expected to be in place by May Gov Gray Davis who has tried to distance himself from the PUCs move sinc e it was unveiled Monday said in a statement yesterday that the rate increas e was premature and that he did not support the decision While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear that a rate increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity he said Several PUC members acknowledged that such a huge rate increase might not have been necessary had the commission acted sooner to remedy Californias power woes We should have done this in January Brown said but we didnt have enou gh information This rate increase is long overdue said Richard Bilas who also sits on the commission We are finally transfusing some blood CONSUMERS PROTEST If so the donor ratepayers did not go willingly to the operating theater A number of citizens rose to speak at yesterdays meeting and not one was in favor of higher power rates This is being shoved down the peoples throats said Dorothy Diez an elderly San Francisco resident Why dont they put the bills where they belong and not on my back She and others called on state officials to take a harder line with outof state power generators which have reaped windfall profits by charging sky high wholesale prices for their electricity Consumer groups urged the PUC to support special taxes on the generators earnings or even seizure of the companies California power plants Your actions are reprehensible Ross Mirkarimi a publicpower supporter told the commission Do not do Gov Davis dirty work The governor did not attend yesterdays meeting but his presence nonethele ss loomed large over the proceedings Consumer advocates derided Davis claims this week that he played no role i n the decision to raise rates They noted that the governors appointees hold a majority on the PUC and worked closely with Davis on a variety of past issues Davis staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its decision DAVIS CONTROLS PUC Gov Davis controls the PUC said Doug Heller assistant organizing director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights He is responsible for the rate hike We are paying more because of the failure of his leadership It seems absurd that Gov Davis is saying his own agency is acting without his consent said Susannah Churchill head of energy policy for the California Public Interest Research Group Hes just looking for political cover The PUC decision was made on a day when Californias grid operators declare d a Stage alert the first in a week indicating that power reserves had dropped below percent When tiered rates are implemented customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co will see rates go up between percent for medium power users and percent for heavy users Those who can keep power consumption to within percent of pre established limits will see no increase beyond the percent rate hike adopted in January Customers of Southern California Edison will see rates increase between a nd percent Bruce Foster an Edison vice president called the rate increase a step in the right direction but said further increases may be needed to defray soaring power costs this summer PGE spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the PUCs decision more closely before determining whether a percent rate hi ke will be sufficient The PUC has done all it can said Lynch the PUC president We have foug ht back hard in every venue possible against unjust energy prices NO FEDERAL HELP In the end though she said state regulators were forced to admit that no help would be forthcoming from federal authorities in capping wholesale pow er rates and that generators would continue exploiting Californias chronic electricity shortage We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on Lynch said Along the same lines the PUC approved a requirement that PGE and Edison repay the state Department of Water Resources for about billion in power purchases made on the cashstrapped utilities behalf The commission also passed a motion forcing PGE and Edison to pay smaller power generators for their output Half of all such generators were shut do wn during last weeks blackouts because they had not been paid by the utilitie s However the PUC is only requiring that utilities pay for future electricit y purchases and did not address the millions of dollars in payments still ow ed the power companies Ann MacLeod executive director of the California Cogeneration Council an association of smaller generators said that by avoiding the question of ba ck debt the PUCs move will do nothing to restore plants to operation These generators will not come back online as a result of this decision she said In fact a greater number likely will have to drop offline Protesters chanting Hell no we wont pay urged consumers after the PUC meeting to not include the higher fees in upcoming bills This is just the beginning said Medea Benjamin who was among the demonstrators evicted from

commissioners to the nation s top energy regulatory body yesterday retaining the current chairman who ha s criticized Californias handling of its energy crisis Bush tapped a fellow Texan Patrick Henry Wood III chairman of the Texas Public Utilities Commission and Nora Mead Brownell a Pennsylvania public utility commissioner to fill two vacancies on the fivemember Federal Ener gy Regulatory Commission The appointments would give Republicans a to majority on FERC as the commission is known and probably solidify the agencys opposition to imposing wholesale energy price caps sought by California Gov Gray Davis a nd Sen Dianne Feinstein both Democrats Both nominations require Senate confirmation and Feinstein indicated yesterday that she might oppose the nominations I would hope they would come in and talk with me she said Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether they would be responsive to the present situation Up to this point the administration has been recalcitrant to th e point of arrogance If that is the case with these new appointees as well they wont have my vote FERC regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines Curt Hebert named chairman by Bush earlier this year will remain in his post Although Heberts outspoken freemarket views are in sync with the administrations there had been speculation that Bush would tap Wood for t he top job Some thought Bush might want a familiar ally to head an agency tha t used to be a regulatory backwater but now is among the most politically sensitive spots in the administration Wood has overseen electric utility deregulation in Texas which is schedule d to open its market to competition Jan but based on a model that differs significantly from Californias scheme Texas has attracted ample n ew power generation since and is experimenting with partial retail competition for commercial users Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvanias electricity deregulation which is cited as a successful contrast to Californias experiment FERC has come under heavy political fire from California Democrats for not cracking down hard enough on alleged price gouging of California utilities by outofstate energy producers Hebert has been sharply critical of Californias response to its electricit y mess once describing Davis plan to take over the utilities transmission lines as nationalization He is adamantly opposed to price controls and enjoys the strong backing of fellow Mississippian and Senate Majority Leade r Trent Lott who pressured the White House to keep him Hebert and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham have voiced strong opposition t o price controls on wholesale electricity arguing that would worsen Californias blackouts by discouraging electricity sales from outside the state Vice President Dick Cheney who met informally with about senators in hi s Senate office yesterday also restated the administrations opposition to price caps telling Feinstein price controls would not work and citing thei r failure in the Nixon administration Feinstein who has said she equates helping California with the willingness to impose federal price caps called Cheneys response very disappointing There was really no overture Feinstein said There was very little willingness to help Not even an offer of help It is truly amazing to me because this crisis is not going

rather tidily sums up Americas haphazard attitude toward energy conservation We gladly rally to trim our energy use by a few percent whether at home at work or in our cars but we ultimately feel little urgency to change the overwhelming wastefulness of our built environment During the past two decades weve done plenty of sparing at the spigot and that can only be applauded Weve passed minimal building energy standards such as Californias Title but then wiped out much of the savings by building the sort of needlessly bloated energyguzzling homes that now sprawl across acre after acre of on ce pastoral landscape Weve enacted minimum standards for gas mileage excepting SUVs but you dont drive one of those do you yet weve made little headway in curbi ng our reliance on the automobile itself How did we get into this jam A fair share of the blame for our disastrous landuse policies belongs at the feet of the very people who insisted they knew better the postwar city planners Theyve left us our current legacy of hyperorganized zoning ordinances that encourage in fact practically mandate urban sprawl These in turn hav e produced a national reliance upon the automobile that has only increased ON THE ROAD AGAIN AND AGAIN Flying in the face of all weve learned about the environment during the pa st decades the year set the alltime record for US automobile sales with some million cars and trucks sold And no wonder Americans remain autocentered Too many planners and state transportation departments still consider freeway expansion programs the solution to our mass transportation woes even though its been demonstrate d time and again that bigger highways merely invite more traffic instead of reducing it We consumers are to blame as well for buying into the idea that a snowballing trend of consumption is the very embodiment of success Were hooked on big houses but because housing prices are so high in the Bay Are a were willing to move out to less populated areas so we can afford them We willingly drive an hour or even two to get to work a commute that wou ld have been considered perfectly absurd even years ago Pretty soon of course the new community is as choked with cars and asphalt as the old one The real pity is that weve recognized the folly of these trends for decade s and weve done next to nothing to even protest them let alone change them PLANNING FOR THE PAST And thanks to the hidebound attitudes of so many civic planning departments little of substance has changed in our land use policy since the s Our hyperorganized zoning ordinances still jealously guard the outdated postwar ideal of the singlefamily home surrounded by largely useless strips of setback land and continue to frown on more intelligent arrangements such as zerolotline construction courtyard homes and mixed commercial and residential planning By all means save all the energy you can But while any move toward conservation is commendable its Americas

immediately are the largest in California history Its terrible we will probably go out of business Sahouria said It s very simple we cannot afford any rate increases PUC commissioners who voted for the rate hikes said they were necessa ry to head off blackouts this summer and to keep the cashstarved utilities fr om going under However the PUC simultaneously ordered the nearly bankrupt utilities to pa y the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers and to pay producers of renewable energy for future electricity deliveries The PUC has done all it can commission president Loretta Lynch said We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices Not all PGE and Edison customers will face higher bills The PUC said it would create a tiered system that will protect lowincome customers and penalize those customers who use the most electricity Ratepayers have labeled the plan a ripoff that could hit as many as million

power alerts Wednesday morning as pow er reserves stayed above percent No explanation given after officials approve percent rate hike Posted at pm PST Tuesday March BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News After months of waiting for the states elected leaders to act California s Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest electricity rate increase in at least two decades and offered no assurance s that more hikes wont be needed soon The cent per kilowatthour increase would boost average rates for all customers by percent although the precise residential and business rate s have yet to be determined It is effective immediately and will show up on bills in May The commissions vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political backdrop Gov Gray Davis who appointed three of its five members said he wasnt consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it But Davis after learning Sunday night about the plan apparently did not seek to block the commissions action Instead he issued a statement immediately after the vote that called it premature because we do not hav e all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Until w e do I cannot support any rate increase The commission however said it had no alternative but to raise rates considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billion s in taxpayer funds on power because its cashstrapped utilities are no longe r creditworthy But even some commissioners were uneasy Davis most recent appointee on th e commission Geoffrey Brown acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that we as commissioners had very little time to review this In fact an administrative law judge using much the same evidence that w as included in the decision to raise rates had concluded recently that no such increase was justified The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of cents pe r kilowatthour Previously officials with Pacific Gas Electric Co and Southern California Edison had only sought a cent per kilowatthour increase Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain whether a cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormou s cost the state has incurred since it began buying power The state still doesnt know how much its effort to bail out PGE and Ediso n which involves a state purchase of the utilities highvoltage lines will cost Its also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on t he expensive electricity spot market this summer and whether an additional ra te increase would be needed to cover that Have we got the number right asked Commissioner Henry Duque in reference to the cent increase I dont know But I hope we have Roderick Wright DLos Angeles who chairs the Assembly Utilities Committee told the commission that he opposed the idea of approving any rate hike now until the state has a better idea of the total amount that consumers ultimately will have to bear By establishing a cent increase now well be back in a short time potentially doing it again he said To be nickeled and dimed to death as were doing here I dont think that does anybody any good Signs of confusion Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused While providing a welcome dose of realism PGE president Gordon Smith said in a prepared statement the rate hike and other actions taken by the commission Tuesday do not offer a comprehensive solution fail to resolve the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability Among PGEs major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated fo r their debts which they claim total about billion and whether PGE or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spo t market Bruce Foster an Edison vice president offered a similar lukewarm endorsement of the increase Im not saying that it will do it he said acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road but he calle d the hike a step in the right direction Rate hike vs bankruptcy Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced into bankruptcy the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger rate hikes to stabilize the companies finances A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one design ed by a bankruptcy judge Bilas said adding that he also was concerned abou t how the state appeared to be buying electricity like a drunken sailor But others reacted angrily to the commissions decision Several protesters hoisted signs at the meeting that read we wont pay and chanted rat e hikes go away make the energy companies pay Police later escorted them out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed at their noisy interruptions Instead of raising rates they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to use the states power of eminent domain to take over the power plants operated by companies accused of gouging the public The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing by the rules of society said Mike Florio senior attorney with The Utili ty Reform Network in San Francisco Theyre economic war criminals Officials in Davis office said Tuesday that they intend to review the commissions action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support i t or seek changes But to some people the governors claim of ignorance abou t the commissions plan and his seeming inability to do anything to stop t he rate hike from being approved severely strained credulity Give me a break said Sen John Vasconcellos DSan Jose Who appoint ed them and whos been giving orders all along Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consid er having consumers pay more for electricity If it becomes clear that a rat e increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state he said I will support one that is fair Dion Nissenbaum and Hallye Jordan contributed to this report Impact of increases will vary greatly Posted at pm PST Tuesday March BY JOHN WOOLFOLK Mercury News The rate increases approved Tuesday will hit Californians in very different ways The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most and nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all Although the details arent yet final state regulators say they intend to fashion a tiered structure to implement the higher rates Heres how th e proposal will affect your bill When do the higher rates kick in Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it wont appear on bills until May While regulators agreed that rates will rise th ey still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost Hearings are expected next month Once the structure is approved regulator s say utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesdays rate approval Do the new rates affect all Californians No The Public Utilities Commission which approved the rate increase has authority over only investorowned utilities Pacific Gas Electric Co Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric which together ser ve about million homes and businesses The increase affects PGE and Edison but not San Diego Municipal utilities including Santa Clara Palo Alto Alameda Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt How will the new rates work Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial a nd powerguzzling residential customers pay a greater share Residential customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their baseline amount What is the baseline The baseline is considered the average household usage It was established years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electrici ty usage over that amount Does everybody have the same baseline No Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in electricity needs caused by regional climate household type and season How many baselines are there PGE residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among three climatic baseline territories the coastal areas including San Francisco and the Peninsula the East Bay and South Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains Within those territories there are separate baselines for singlefamily homes and multifamily apartment complexes as well as for homes with only electric appliances instead of both gas and electric In addition baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage Summe r rates begin May and winter rates begin Nov How do I find out my baseline Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatthours and the rate you are billed for that amount It also shows how much power you used over the baseline and the rate you were billed for it How does the baseline affect my bill Customers already pay about percent more for power they use over their baseline Under the proposed tiered rates PGE customers who use no more than percent of their baseline amount wouldnt pay any more than they d o now PGE customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average percent increase in monthly bills Those who use more than twice their baseline would see an average increase of percent Edison customers woul d have similar rates Almost half of the utilities customers dont exceed percent of their baseline Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase The increase can be calculated many ways The commission approved an increa se of cents a kilowatthour three times the cent surcharge approved in January which was made permanent Tuesday Because the cent increase averaged percent some have said that plus the cents amounts to a percent increase Others have added cents to the amount the utilities charge just for electricity which for PGE is now cents and come up with a percent increase Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges others have added cents to the average total rate of cents for all customers a percent increase Under the tiered proposal the average residential rate would rise percent from cents to cents But average bills for residents bills would increase up to percent depending on electricity use Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesnt apply to commercial and industrial businesses In fact the proposal calls for a proportionately greater increase for businesses which pay lower rates than residential customers Commercial customers would see a percent increase Industrial customers generally over kilowatthours a month would see a percent increase But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power Go v Gray Davis this month ordered percent rebates for all customers who redu ce electricity usage percent over last year between June and September Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on percent reduction of total consumption while commercial and industrial rebates wil l be based on percent reduction of peak load If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now will I have to pay more Possibly The

Naturalgasdependent alternative generators say that even if the major utilities begin paying them for energy it wont be enough cash State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas Electric to start paying alternativeenergy producers per megawatthour But alternative generators that use natural gas say thats at least below what it costs to produce the energy On the short run we cant generate said David Lloyd of NRG Energy Inc which this month shut down its megawatt plant in the Bay area that sel ls steam to the CH sugar factory next door It just costs so much for electricity Alternative generators have been paid little or nothing the past four months and are now collectively owed more than billion by the utilities The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or sh ut down their plants resulting in a megawatt loss to California enoug h to power million homes That was a factor in blackouts last week and th e states Stage energy alert Tuesday There are two classes of alternative generators renewables which use sola r wind or cleanburning technologies to produce energy and cogenerators which use natural gas to produce energy but share the heat output with a manufacturer Renewables which make up half of the alternativeener gy megawatts say theyre likely to continue producing but would like to be pa id what theyve been owed the past four months PUC spokeswoman Kyle Devine said per megawatthour should work for generators if the natural gas is transported through

premature SP is unsure how conservation will affect revenue March By JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Register SACRAMENTO Gov Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate hikes saying he would support them if it becomes clear it is absolutely necessary for the good of the state The governors statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities Commission a panel controlled by Davis appointees endorsed a plan to rai se monthly bills by as much percent The increase eventually would be tied to a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more medium users those who conserve energy will pay moderately more and heavy users will pay a lot more Details of the plan are not yet set Davis called the PUCs decision premature saying scant information was available to justify increases While I have opposed rate increases if it becomes clear a rate increase i s absolutely necessary for the good of the state I will support one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity Davis said Boosting electricity rates to help resolve Californias energy crisis is likely to increase the states billion revenue bond sale to billion or more entailing more interest charges and a longer payback Standard and Poors the Wall Street creditrating agency called the ratin g plan a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of electricity It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected and whether revenue s will slip under the rateraising formula as consumers respond by conserving electricity SP said Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided The state which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities says it has first rights to the money The utilities have challenged that California hopes to borrow billion by selling revenue bonds in May to cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December Through April those costs are expected to total billion The bond money also will be used to pay for power under longterm contracts which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used Critics have questioned whether billion will be sufficient PUC

group of senators I practically begged for a period of reliability and stability so we could get through th e summer and I didnt get any feeling back that there was going to be any help Cheney insisted Feinstein said that California has to straighten itself out and was not moved by the fact that the Public Utility Commission was poised to increase rates nearly percent After the meeting Feinstein sent President George W Bush a twopage lette r Your administration has not yet offered any constructive solution to this problem she wrote If the federal government continues to ignore the situation the result may very well be economic disaster for millions of small businesses and residents Feinstein wrote a final plea that Bush meet with her and Sen Gordon Smith ROre who is cosponsoring a bill authorizing shortterm regional price caps Bush on Tuesday reiterated his position against price caps in a speech in Michigan Feinstein has heard little sympathy for her state from colleagues who have repeatedly said Californians have not felt any real pain Rep Jennifer Dun n RWash recently complained that Californians were turning on their hot tu bs without worrying about paying higher costs Feinstein said such criticism is exaggerated But she said she hopes the ra te increase approved by the PUC will show critics the state is doing the righ t thing Sen Barbara Boxer DCalif who said she was not invited to meet with Cheney said she was concerned that the rate increase would be making consumers bear the brunt of the electricity crisis Before a rate increase is considered Boxer said the PUC should make sure average residential consumers and small businesses are protected and take whatever legal action is available against those generating companies who

too Carney said Conserve and save A proposed tieredbilling format is designed to spare low power users from the rate increases Baseline is the bottom line March By ANNE C MULKERN and KATE BERRY The Orange County Register The states power crisis hit your wallet Tuesday when state regulators hike d electricity rates as much as percent Your bill could be headed up as a result Here are answers to some of your questions about the rate hike Q How much more will I pay A Details of the plan havent been finalized But the idea is to create a threelevel rate structure Those who use more electricity will pay the highest rates and those who conserve will save Consumers who use less than l percent of their baseline power allocation will escape any increase We explain baseline below The rate increase will be distributed across the two higher tiers The Publ ic Utilities Commission over the next days will come up with a plan to determine exact rates for the two higher levels as well as for different types of customers such as residential and small business Q So what is baseline A Baseline is the portion of your usage considered necessary for essential s To encourage conservation its set below the amount most people use The percentage of Edison customers who use less than percent of baselin e is roughly percent in winter months and percent in the summer Because baseline is set based on the average households use it means a single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a homeowner with four children Baseline varies depending on where you live Warmer areas get higher baselines There are different baselines for the summer and winter People who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocation s Allelectric homes get higher baselines Q Whats the reason for this rate hike Are they really doing this to get people to conserve A Conservation is a side benefit The primary motivation is money The state has already shelled out billion buying power in the last three months for customers of the nearinsolvent utilities The state plans to issue bonds which will be paid for by consumers to cov er the power purchases But Wall Street bankers must have proof of a steady revenue stream a rate increase to convince them the bonds can be repaid However people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their power so the plan will also help reduce demand Q Im already conserving How can I cut my bill further A Its nittygritty time Replace your incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs Clean those coils at the back of your refrigerator Turn your air conditioner down or off Reduce the amount of time you use your po ol pump Many items in your house use electricity when they are plugged in even if theyre not in use You can cut consumption by unplugging your television computer coffeepot toaster and blow dryer Q When will I pay the increase A The rate hike takes effect immediately But it could take Southern California Edison a month to days to implement it so you could face retroactive charges on a followup bill Q I live in south Orange County and buy electricity from San Diego Gas Electric Co Does this plan affect me A No SDGE has applied for a rate increase but state regulators have not yet voted on that request Q Im outraged We didnt ask for deregulation and now were paying more How can I protest A Call or write you state lawmakers and the governor You can also join on e of the consumer groups fighting the rate hike such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights It is at The Utility Reform Network is at National Desk Section A RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA By EVELYN NIEVES The New York Times Page Column c New York Times Company SAN FRANCISCO March Californias power regulators approved the large st utility rate increases in state history today in an effort to avert more rolling blackouts and keep the states principal electricity producers from collapsing in bankruptcy Despite Gov Gray Daviss repeated statements that no new rate increases would be needed to keep the states two largest utilities solvent the Stat e Public Utilities Commission said today that it had no choice but to raise rates by up to percent for customers of the two utilities to avoid a greater catastrophe if the companies went bankrupt We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices said Loretta Lynch the commission president and a Davis appointee who had proposed the increases on Monday Ms Lynch said that under a tiered rate system that would be hammered out within the next days heavy power users would face the greatest increase s while light users would face little or no increases Customers will see the rate increases in their May utility bills Perhaps percent of consumers under this system including the poorest residents who would be exempt will face no increase at all Ms Lynch said Heavy users will face increases of about percent she said Coupled with the average percent temporary rate increase in January that the commission made permanent today those consumers will pay percent mo re for utilities than they did in December But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates increase could feel the impact if commercial power customers from small businesses to megastores pass on their higher electricity costs through price increases Before the rate increases power costs in California were slightly higher than the national average but lower than the prices paid in New York and other Northeastern States Residential electricity users already pay an average of about a month state officials say In addition under a previous commission decision rates will go up an additional percent nex t year The commission which approved the rate increase to also voted to require that the two large utilities the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison reimburse the states Department of Water Resources billion spent on their behalf and begin paying alternative energy generators which account for more than a quarter of the states dai ly energy needs The two utilities have not paid their bills for months sayin g they are nearly bankrupt because under deregulation of the power industry wholesalers have been allowed to float prices while retail rates were cappe d The Department of Water Resources has spent million a day since January buying power on the utilities behalf Small alternative energy producers h ad not been paid at all for months with dire consequences For two days last week the states power managers were forced to order rolling blackouts across parts of the state in part because the small energy producers shut down half their capacity because they had not been paid The rate increases will make the payoff more feasible Ms Lynch said whil e encouraging energy conservation But a representative of the states alternativeenergy generators known as qualifying facilities complained that the commission did nothing to address the roughly billion the utilities owed producers Im not sure what our options are at this point if the state wants the qualified facilities to be a part of the solution said David Fogarty a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association and alternativeener gy cogenerators representing about alternativeenergy producers in California For those on all sides the commission seemed to raise as many questions as it answered Consumer advocates who interrupted the hearing five times questioned why the commission had decided on the vote so abruptly with onl y hour notice to the public Spokesmen for each of the utility companies said they had no idea what the rate increases would mean to the average customer until the tiered system was determined They also said they did no t know whether these new rates would mean the end of rolling blackouts They may know something that I dont know said Bruce Foster vice president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison speaking of the commissions vote outside the hearing room Mr Foster also complained that the commissions directive to begin paying bills to the state and the alternative energy producers or face a penalt y equal to the amount owed might be illegal and said that the company woul d look into appealing it Ron Low a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric also complained that the commissions actions seemed rushed and lacked specifics The rate increase will generate about billion a year for Pacific Gas a nd Electric unit of PGE and billion for Southern California Edison a unit of Edison International While those revenues will help the utilities buy power on the wholesale market in the future the commission made no provision for paying off about billion in debt accumulated by the utilities as a result of past wholesale costs That issue would be left to the governor and state legislators The commission heard public comment before the vote but did not answer questions afterward Consumer advocates were furious many blaming Governor Davis The governor today issued a statement calling the commissions move premature From the beginning Ive said that my main goal was to solve this problem while protecting the consumer from undue rate hikes Mr Dav is said The PUCs action today was premature because we do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision Mr Daviss statement seemed to reflect the awareness he and his aides feel about the potential political backlash from big rate increases Even as oth er politicians warned that such increases would be necessary Mr Davis has vowed to avoid them On Monday he insisted that he had not spoken to any members of the commission about the rate increase proposal and that he had no control over its actions But Mr Davis appointed three of the bodys five members and since taking office two years ago he has been emphatic in saying that he expects his appointees to state boards and commissions to reflect his policies He also did not hesitate to complain that he could not control the previous members of the commission because they were Republican appointees and his aides acknowledged that top gubernatorial advisers had consulted with Ms Lynch and approved her plans Politicians in both parties said Mr Davis was trying to shift blame for an y rate increase to the commission while claiming that increases were approved over his objections They predicted that that effort could backfire by maki ng Mr Davis look both timorous and calculating Chart THE COST The Price of Power Average cost per kilowatthour fo r residential customers for Chart shows costs for following states Connecticut Maine

protesters jeered Hell no we wont pay California regulators approved electricity rate increases of up to perce nt Tuesday to head off blackouts this summer and keep the states two biggest utilities from going under The increases approved by the Public Utilities Commission are the biggest in California history and take effect immediately for the millio n people served by Pacific Gas and Electric Co and Southern California Ediso n Co The PUC has done all it can commission president Loretta Lynch said We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust energy prices The PUC also ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers Just how much wasnt known the state has not disclosed how much it has spent on various long and shortterm power contracts For the rate increase the commission said it will create a tiered system that will protect poor people and penalize customers who use the most electricity Lynch proposed the higher rates as a way to force electricity hogs to conserve and to help keep SoCal Edison and PGE solvent The plan is also seen as a way to protect Californias budget surplus whic h is being drained of million to million a day as the state buys powe r for the cashstrapped utilities Since the crisis began more than billion in taxpayer money has been spent to keep the lights on SoCal Edison and PGE say they have lost more than billion since last summer because of high wholesale electricity prices and because California s deregulation law prevents the utilities from passing those costs on to their customers Both have urged the PUC to raise rates Following the PUC meeting SoCal Edison said it will begin paying interest to bondholders after weeks of missing payments The rate increase will be on top of the percent to percent hike approv ed by the PUC in January and a percent increase already scheduled for next year Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a ripoff We are being held hostage by a handful of energy companies that under deregulation got control of our electricity supply said Harvey Rosenfield president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica Until our elected officials start acting to protect us we are going to be at their mercy at the mercy of this ripoff Democratic Gov Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that he has no power over the PUC However three of the PUC members are his appointees And his aides have told lawmakers that rates have to rise Residents already pay about per month for electricity cents per kilowatt hour to SoCal Edison and cents per kwh to PGE The latest rate hike would mean a percent increase for SoCal Edison customers and percent for PGE customers for electricity alone Since th e rates are bundled with other fees the average price of a kilowatt hour is closer to cents for SoCal Edison customers and cents for PGE customers Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much th e plan will cost customers because the effects of the tiered system are not known The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters and dismay over the plan was seen elsewhere Sam Sahouria owner of the Fox Plaza Grocery and Deli in San Francisco sai d rate hikes could be too much for his familyrun store to bear Its terrible We will probably go out of business he said Belinda Lazzerini who serves fruit smoothies at Jitters Shakes in Sa n Francisco said her electric bills have jumped to for her studio apartment The Laundromat has gone up from to so now we will have to clean our clothes by hand and dry them in the basement she said Its crazy The state has pledged to issue at least billion in revenue bonds to buy power for SoCal Edison and PGE bonds that would be repaid by the utilities customers However state officials have told lawmakers that sta te efforts to help the utilities could hit billion by Californias Independent System Operator declared a Stage alert Tuesday a s electricity reserves dropped to about percent The alert follows two days of statewide rolling blackouts last week and two others in January ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said many power plant s that use alternative sources of energy remained down in part because haven t been paid by the utilities

Acquisition of IPALCO by Will McNamara Director Electric Industry Analysis The AES Corporation NYSE AES announced that it has completed its acquisition of IPALCO Enterprises the Indianapolis Indbased utility wit h MW of generation and customers in and around Indianapolis IPALCO has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of AES through an exchange of shares in which each outstanding share of IPALCO common stock will be exchanged for shares of AES common stock IPALCO common stock was suspended from trading at the close of the market on March Analysis The purchase of IPALCO an established and respected utility in t he Midwest will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an d further the companys aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid e of its business AES already owns CILCORP an energy services company whose largest subsidiary CILCO serves portions of Illinois and Missouri Note that pursuant to an SEC order AES will restructure andor sell its ownersh ip interests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an exempt holding company under PUHCA Thus through the purchase of IPALCO AES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has established In addition from this purchase we now know that AES along wi th being a global player intends to remain dominant throughout the United States as well Further the acquisition represents a rather bright development for AES considering that the company has recently encountered some ongoing challenges related to its operations in California First lets examine the value of AES acquisition of IPALCO Certainly th e MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima ry draw but from comments made by Dennis Bakke AES president and CEO the company apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana an d the Midwest as a whole IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the aggressive management of AES the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as Indianapolis Power Light will now stand a much better chance for global development and expansion As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made the company secure s a decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but fewer hard assets With its strong generation portfolio to which the IPALC O purchase only adds AES can further guarantee to potential customers a reliable power supply AES is one of the largest generation companies in th e world having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions The companys generating assets include interests in facilities totalin g over gigawatts of capacity By comparison Calpine has approximately MW Dynegy has a net ownership of MW and Reliant has about MW In addition AES electricity distribution network has over km of conductor and associated rights of way and sells over GWh per year to over million enduser customers AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an aggressive growth strategy over the past year Recent milestones for the company are too many to list here However highlights include acquiring a controlling interest in Electricidad de Caracas acquiring percent interest in Tractebel Power purchasing percent interest in the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin Nev and purchasing GeoUtilities Inc an Internetbased superstore for energy and telecom services Just since the start of AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy assets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corporation of Waltham Mass for million and announced new generation development projects in Texas and California AES also has continued its international expansion with an acquisition of a MW oilfired cogeneration facility in Italy the acquisition of a MW bargemounted naturalgas fired generating business in Nigeria and the purchase of additional ownership interest in a MW hydro plant in Argentina As Ive said in the past AES is a company to watch Even when acquisitions that AES is making seem rather small they must be taken within the context of the portfolio that AES is building Whether its generation retail marketing telecom or selling electricity over the Internet AES has a foothold in many different areas AES is a major player that can offer the full package to a customer which may in the end be its strongest advantage The company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses whic h are all equally important to its strategy power generation network delive ry services and retail energy marketing However it is important to recognize that AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the capability to market its commodity products through its marketing subsidiaries However although AES has had a fairly successful year the company has hit some bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way all of which were related to the California market AES has established several tolling agreements with Williams Corp for the power plants that AES owns in California Under the tolling agreements AES essentially rents its plants to Williams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity which it then c an sell on the wholesale market In other words Williams had a contract to market all of the power generated by AES California plants In hindsight AES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen ts with Williams in California Although AES did well last year with net inco me rising percent to million the company reportedly lost million on the lucrative California market Meanwhile Williams NYSE WMB reporte d unaudited income from continuing operations of million or per share on a diluted basis versus million or cents per share on a restated basis for AES also took a hit when it had to pay air pollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio ns to Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down Further AES along with other companies continues to fall under the inten se scrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed unjust and unreasonable for power generated at AESowned plants FERCs investigation centers on the unavailability of certain socalled must run generating plants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland a subsidiar y of AES A must run plant is a generating facility that the California ISO can call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the reliability of the California transmission network Several weeks ago FERC announced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t he actions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES On March FERC gave the two companies days to explain why they should not refund million to California utilities Further FERC said that Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages of two AESowne d plants last April and May Williams received more revenues as a result of the respective outages the commission said AES responded to the charges by saying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not share in market revenues from sales of power from the plants According to a report in The Washington Post AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa id that as long as the plants are in operating condition Williams decides whe n they will run and what it will charge for their power As a result of the unavailability of the two must run AES plants the states ISO had to obtain power from other plants also owned by AES where the power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger profits The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and Williams refused to make the two must run plants available for reasons that were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance of the plant Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale market now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the states market Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to participate in the California market it may be a smart move for the compan y to focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States suc h as the Midwest Yet how AES acquisition of IPALCO will impact the companys bottom line remains to be seen Standard Poors SP is reserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being and is keeping AES on CreditWatch AES doubleB corporate credit singleBpl us rating on subordinated debt and singleB rating on the companys trust preferred securities remain intact pending further review and information about the acquisition of IPALCO Also Slowered its corporate credit ra tings on IPALCO to tripleB from singleAplus and IPALCOs subsidiary Indianapolis Power Light Co IPL to tripleB from doubleAminus and revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative Sex pects to address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks On March AES shares closed at about As of midmorning on March AES shares were priced at about Over the last few days AES shares have increased by about percent and have closely tracked the Dow Jones Utility Average An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at wwwConsultRCIcom Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every

position onI would assume yesbut wanted to close the loop CalISO Wants Pwr Generators To Forward Bid Sources Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator is expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority to force generators to bid of their supply into the forward market in an effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state according to a source familiar with the issue An official with the states Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the details of the filing The filing calls for FERC to set a just and reasonable rate for a large fraction of suppliers capacity while remaining supply would be able to earn marketbased rates according to the source In addition major outofstate generators would have to enter into forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for a significant portion of their expected sales ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower wholesale energy costs He is expected to announce how bidding into the forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs The states Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing with federal regulators in the near future sources said In addition forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of market power the ISO has said in prior meetings Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators can influence power prices According to an ISO report market power occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of generation ownership allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high demand periods About to of the power purchased this past summer was done in the spot market an unusually high percentage according to the ISO In order to mitigate market power the filing calls for utilities to enter into twoyear forward contracts with generators to shield against the daily market price fluctuations Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a key source of high power costs in the summer of according to an ISO report The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid operators board of governors Usually a majority of the board is required to approve such an action EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action The announcement of the ISOs expected filing came as a surprise to Gary Heath executive director of the states Electricity Oversight Board Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news conference Were trying to find out whats behind this Heath told Dow Jones Newswires Were not sure if they could do this without board approval It came as a surprise Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month FERC launched an investigation into Californias troubled power market this past

position onI would assume yesbut wanted to close the loop CalISO Wants Pwr Generators To Forward Bid Sources Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES Dow JonesThe California Independent System Operator is expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority to force generators to bid of their supply into the forward market in an effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state according to a source familiar with the issue An official with the states Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the details of the filing The filing calls for FERC to set a just and reasonable rate for a large fraction of suppliers capacity while remaining supply would be able to earn marketbased rates according to the source In addition major outofstate generators would have to enter into forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for a significant portion of their expected sales ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower wholesale energy costs He is expected to announce how bidding into the forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs The states Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing with federal regulators in the near future sources said In addition forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of market power the ISO has said in prior meetings Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators can influence power prices According to an ISO report market power occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of generation ownership allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high demand periods About to of the power purchased this past summer was done in the spot market an unusually high percentage according to the ISO In order to mitigate market power the filing calls for utilities to enter into twoyear forward contracts with generators to shield against the daily market price fluctuations Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a key source of high power costs in the summer of according to an ISO report The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid operators board of governors Usually a majority of the board is required to approve such an action EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action The announcement of the ISOs expected filing came as a surprise to Gary Heath executive director of the states Electricity Oversight Board Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news conference Were trying to find out whats behind this Heath told Dow Jones Newswires Were not sure if they could do this without board approval It came as a surprise Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month FERC launched an investigation into Californias troubled power market this past
