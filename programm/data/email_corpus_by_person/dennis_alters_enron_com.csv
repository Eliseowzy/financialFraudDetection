mailtoIMCEANOTESKettlewellCLindaClkettlewelltribune EcomE NRONcom Sent Wednesday March AM To Alters Dennis Subject Article on SunSentinelcom By DAVID FLESHLER SunSentinel Webposted pm Mar The power plant proposed for Pompano Beach moved a step Tuesday toward being built as the states airquality regulators announced plans to issue a construction permit The state Department of Environmental Protection this week will publish notices of its intent to grant the permit to Enron Corp which is facing vigorous opposition to its plans for a megawatt plant just east of Floridas Turnpike The notices will trigger a day comment period with the final decision likely a month or two after that The department made the decision after a lengthy review that showed the plant would have little impact on the regions air quality said Alvaro Linero the DEP administrator who handled the permit application Relying on clean natural gas as its primary fuel the plant would emit far less pollution than other power plants in the area he said Its hot gases would soar upward from the foot stacks so that neighborhoods near the plant would experience no more pollution than other neighborhoods And there are commitments on its operating schedule and fuel quality that will reduce its environmental impact he said They showed they will have a fairly minimal impact on air quality in the area and will be using the best available control technology Linero said The plant would operate as a peaking plant meaning it would go into service only when a public utility needed a backup source of power Its permit would allow it to operate a maximum of hours a year or just under hours a day The plant would emit up to tons a year of nitrogen oxide a key cause of smog according to the DEP analysis It would emit up to tons a year of sulfur dioxide which generates fine particles that can lodge deep in the lungs Both pollutants can aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma and emphysema But Linero said the amounts would be minimal compared to the total amount of pollution in the region The plant at Port Everglades for example emits far more of both pollutants And motor vehicles accounted for tons of nitrogen oxide in when Broward County last did a full air pollution inventory according to county records A key section of the proposed permit concerns diesel fuel which the company plans to use when its supply of natural gas is interrupted Diesel fuel emits much more pollution than natural gas but the company made some commitments to reduce the effects Linero said It agreed to limit its diesel use to hours a year down from its original proposal of hours And for every hour of diesel operation over hours it will reduce its total annual operations by two hours For example if it uses its maximum hours of diesel fuel it will operate the plant for a total of only hours for the year The diesel fuel will be highquality lowsulfur fuel Linero said We negotiated with the company to try to minimize the amount of diesel fuel usage and maximize the usage of natural gas he said We also reviewed the pollutioncontrol equipment that is designed into these units and determined that it meets bestavailable control technology The DEP permit represents one of the major hurdles the company faces The other is the application to rezone the acre site for the plant The City Commission is expected to vote next month on whether to change the lands zoning from industrial to utility The project faces heavy opposition in Margate Coconut Creek and some sections of Pompano Beach Nothing that DEP said on Tuesday gave opponents any comfort Even if the plant would emit less nitrogen oxide than other plants they said it would still be a new source of pollution Even if the company agrees to limit its hours and operate it as a peaking plant they said those restrictions could change once the plant is in place And they said the state had an unimpressive track record on environmental protection The state also approved the deposit of ash in Pompano Beach and they also approved the canker eradication program where healthy trees were cut down said Pompano Beach Commissioner Kay McGinn So they dont have much credibility Coconut Creek Commissioner Jim Waldman said the plant would eventually be able to throw off restrictions on its use and operate as a fulltime power plant I dont think its going to be operated the way its been applied for he said I dont think its just going to be a peaking plant I think its going to be operating at capacity Once its there it will be easier for the state to allow it to be used as a regular source of energy And I dont think the proper controls will be there at the time Officials at Enron a multinational company based in Houston said the states decision came as little surprise since they had been negotiating various restrictions on the plants operations in order to win approval Its a permit that DEP ought to be proud of said Eric Thode a spokesman for the company Its a very stringent permit The department will accept comments on the proposed permit at a public meeting from to pm on March at the Pompano Beach Civic Center Written comments may be
