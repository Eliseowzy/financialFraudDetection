Content Strategy Meeting Thank you for your participation in yesterdays meeting Please review the below meeting notes Sincerely Marie Hejka Content Strategy Meeting Notes Attendees Allen Elliott mynetworkcom David Gossett mywEBSourcecom Marie Hejka KM Task Force Chair Anthony Mends mywEBSourcecom Brandon Rigney myhomeenroncom Meeting Details The above group met to discuss the content strategy for the KM Task Force portal Our intention is to synergize the collective intelligence of these teams to develop a best practices portal The task force is in a unique position because the portal we will develop from is Bryan Powells mynetworkcom which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigneys myhomeenroncom it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members The question to ask is are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can determine what to include in a portal The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop What is more important and challenging is the process established perhaps by a centralized KM effort by which information or content is made available to all given portals It is the content accessible through a portal which determines the success of the portal Yahoocom users through a minimal number of starting points may access some containers of information For our project it has not been determined what information what content needs to be accessed from a portal The answer to this question should predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial dashboard of the portal Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what specific content to make available through the portal No we have neither the time nor the responsibility to undertake this But how then does the task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don t have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access The requirements phase should predict this What is most challenging about content The answer locking down the containerable information content to bridge to portals Information need s to be syndicated In order for it to be syndicated it must be in an appropriate container Containerable information is information th at can be shown as a channel In other words containerable information is information that can be accessed from the portal Not all information on a given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained A KM strategy should propose a method to identify develop and maintain information a portal can capture Meeting Conclusion The development of any business structure should be driven by business needs Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and person to person the task of developing a portal as the single interface f or all Enron Business Units is large Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to develop the content strategy for a best practices portal Requirements PhaseDesign PhaseBuild PhaseTest Phase Launch Phas e We are currently in the requirements phase of this project Although multiple personalized portals have been developed unveiled and implemente d we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal The task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge Management proposal In this proposal we may consider the process through which containerable information is identified developed and maintained In the meantime the content strategy team is available for the task force members to consult The content strategy team will help Bryan Powells team shape mynetworkcom With respect to content strategy some of the responsibilities a KM proposa l should review include A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to contain A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the O drive and other assets A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby specific needs of communities are identified and reflected in a best practices portal A plan to develop a process for shutting off old channels ie email fro m Office of the Chairman and turning on new channels ie portal delivery o f Office of the Chairman information Next Steps Identify content strategy to dos for the requirements phase Identify owners of content strategy to dos for the requirements phase Establish weekly meetings for content strategy

Sponsor Follow Up Meetings Philippe Bibi After PW reviewed a number of portal applications Philippe said they were good but not difficult He requested to see transaction process and single sign on applications PW showed Philippe their Travel application PW emphasized this was the only way employees could schedule travel Previously employees would call the number and incur a charge The online portal applications reduced the charge to PW emphasized Chrysler was spending million per year in training The portal provided a skills inventory application which resulted in reduci ng the training expenditures down to million per year Philippe could se e how this would be of value in a bluecollar environment but could not see t he value in our environment Philippe asked PW if they could demonstrate an application which was not something shrink wrapped off the shelf PW showed him their stock option application and the training application PW emphasized HP had autonomous Business Units which needed to be united under this portal Every day of HP global employees access the portal Why The portal is the only way to access a number of job related applications Philippe asked about ad hoc reports He said Enron has a problem getting a d hoc reports He said canned reports are not very useful Further he cann ot get a quick ad hoc report of all the consultants currently billing and at what expense Philippe said the ability to get in to SAP is a drawback How did HP addre ss applications that were not web enabled Content management tools like iCli ck and interwoven were used as delivery mechanisms for making enhanced applications available via the web Philippe said this is a vehicle to pull together travel ibuyit Paine Webber Benefits facilities aviation conferencevideo calls What about the guy who is doing trading logistics settlements transactions with the pipelines Could this portal provide for that person Philippe sees the only benefit for this person would be the single

Marie HejkaCorpEnron on PM Marie Hejka PM To David GossettEnron nron Communications Anthony MendsEnron nron Communications Brandon NRON Allen CT cc Bryan CT George nron John NRON Subject KM Task Force Content Strategy Meeting Thank you for your participation in yesterdays meeting Please review the below meeting notes Sincerely Marie Hejka Content Strategy Meeting Notes Attendees Allen Elliott mynetworkcom David Gossett mywEBSourcecom Marie Hejka KM Task Force Chair Anthony Mends mywEBSourcecom Brandon Rigney myhomeenroncom Meeting Details The above group met to discuss the content strategy for the KM Task Force portal Our intention is to synergize the collective intelligence of these teams to develop a best practices portal The task force is in a unique position because the portal we will develop from is Bryan Powells mynetworkcom which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigneys myhomeenroncom it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members The question to ask is are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can determine what to include in a portal The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop What is more important and challenging is the process established perhaps by a centralized KM effort by which information or content is made available to all given portals It is the content accessible through a portal which determines the success of the portal Yahoocom users through a minimal number of starting points may access some containers of information For our project it has not been determined what information what content needs to be accessed from a portal The answer to this question should predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial dashboard of the portal Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what specific content to make available through the portal No we have neither the time nor the responsibility to undertake this But how then does the task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don t have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access The requirements phase should predict this What is most challenging about content The answer locking down the containerable information content to bridge to portals Information need s to be syndicated In order for it to be syndicated it must be in an appropriate container Containerable information is information th at can be shown as a channel In other words containerable information is information that can be accessed from the portal Not all information on a given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained A KM strategy should propose a method to identify develop and maintain information a portal can capture Meeting Conclusion The development of any business structure should be driven by business needs Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and person to person the task of developing a portal as the single interface f or all Enron Business Units is large Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to develop the content strategy for a best practices portal Requirements PhaseDesign PhaseBuild PhaseTest Phase Launch Phas e We are currently in the requirements phase of this project Although multiple personalized portals have been developed unveiled and implemente d we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal The task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge Management proposal In this proposal we may consider the process through which containerable information is identified developed and maintained In the meantime the content strategy team is available for the task force members to consult The content strategy team will help Bryan Powells team shape mynetworkcom With respect to content strategy some of the responsibilities a KM proposa l should review include A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to contain A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the O drive and other assets A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby specific needs of communities are identified and reflected in a best practices portal A plan to develop a process for shutting off old channels ie email fro m Office of the Chairman and turning on new channels ie portal delivery o f Office of the Chairman

applications PW showed Philippe their Travel application PW emphasized this was the only way employees could schedule travel Previously employees would call the number and incur a charge The online portal applications reduced the charge to PW emphasized Chrysler was spending million per year in training The portal provided a skills inventory application which resulted in reduci ng the training expenditures down to million per year Philippe could se e how this would be of value in a bluecollar environment but could not see t he value in our environment Philippe asked PW if they could demonstrate an application which was not something shrink wrapped off the shelf PW showed him their stock option application and the training application PW emphasized HP had autonomous Business Units

Content Strategy Meeting Thank you for your participation in yesterdays meeting Please review the below meeting notes Sincerely Marie Hejka Content Strategy Meeting Notes Attendees Allen Elliott mynetworkcom David Gossett mywEBSourcecom Marie Hejka KM Task Force Chair Anthony Mends mywEBSourcecom Brandon Rigney myhomeenroncom Meeting Details The above group met to discuss the content strategy for the KM Task Force portal Our intention is to synergize the collective intelligence of these teams to develop a best practices portal The task force is in a unique position because the portal we will develop from is Bryan Powells mynetworkcom which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigneys myhomeenroncom it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members The question to ask is are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can determine what to include in a portal The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop What is more important and challenging is the process established perhaps by a centralized KM effort by which information or content is made available to all given portals It is the content accessible through a portal which determines the success of the portal Yahoocom users through a minimal number of starting points may access some containers of information For our project it has not been determined what information what content needs to be accessed from a portal The answer to this question should predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial dashboard of the portal Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what specific content to make available through the portal No we have neither the time nor the responsibility to undertake this But how then does the task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don t have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access The requirements phase should predict this What is most challenging about content The answer locking down the containerable information content to bridge to portals Information need s to be syndicated In order for it to be syndicated it must be in an appropriate container Containerable information is information th at can be shown as a channel In other words containerable information is information that can be accessed from the portal Not all information on a given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained A KM strategy should propose a method to identify develop and maintain information a portal can capture Meeting Conclusion The development of any business structure should be driven by business needs Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and person to person the task of developing a portal as the single interface f or all Enron Business Units is large Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to develop the content strategy for a best practices portal Requirements PhaseDesign PhaseBuild PhaseTest Phase Launch Phas e We are currently in the requirements phase of this project Although multiple personalized portals have been developed unveiled and implemente d we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal The task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge Management proposal In this proposal we may consider the process through which containerable information is identified developed and maintained In the meantime the content strategy team is available for the task force members to consult The content strategy team will help Bryan Powells team shape mynetworkcom With respect to content strategy some of the responsibilities a KM proposa l should review include A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to contain A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the O drive and other assets A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby specific needs of communities are identified and reflected in a best practices portal A plan to develop a process for shutting off old channels ie email fro m Office of the Chairman and turning on new channels ie portal delivery o f Office of the Chairman

will develop from is Bryan Powells mynetworkcom which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigneys myhomeenroncom it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members The question to ask is are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can determine what to include in a portal The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop What is more important and challenging is the process established perhaps by a centralized KM effort by which information or content is made available to all given portals It is the content accessible through a portal which determines the success of the portal Yahoocom users through a minimal number of starting points may access some containers of information For our project it has not been determined what information what content needs to be accessed from a portal The answer to this question should predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial dashboard of the portal Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what specific content to make available through the portal No we have neither the time nor the responsibility to undertake this But how then does the task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don t have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access The requirements phase should predict this What is most challenging about content The answer locking down the containerable information content to bridge to portals Information need s to be syndicated In order for it to be syndicated it must be in an appropriate container Containerable information is information th at can be shown as a channel In other words containerable information is information that can be accessed from the portal Not all information on a given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained A KM strategy should propose a method to identify develop and maintain information a portal can capture Meeting Conclusion The development of any business structure should be driven by business needs Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and person to person the task of developing a portal as the single interface f or all Enron Business Units is large Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to develop the content strategy for a best practices portal Requirements PhaseDesign PhaseBuild PhaseTest Phase Launch Phas e We are currently in the requirements phase of this project Although multiple personalized portals have been developed unveiled and implemente d we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal The task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge Management proposal In this proposal we may consider the process through which containerable information is identified developed and maintained In the meantime the content strategy team is available for the task force members to consult The content strategy team will help Bryan Powells team shape mynetworkcom With respect to content strategy some of the responsibilities a KM proposa l should review include A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to contain A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the O drive and other assets A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby specific needs of communities are identified and reflected in a best practices portal A plan to develop a process for shutting off old channels ie email fro m Office of the Chairman and turning on new channels ie portal delivery o f Office of the Chairman information Next Steps Identify content strategy to dos for the requirements phase Identify owners of content strategy to dos for the requirements phase Establish weekly meetings for content strategy team Content strategy team members gain authorization from management to support task force
