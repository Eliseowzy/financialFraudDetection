Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forwa rd to others in your group Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D iabetes Research Foundation JDRF walk This year the walk will be held o n Sunday October at Greenspoint Mall As some of you may know Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that is very important to him There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty pe insulindependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes The other type of diabetes is Type adultonset diabetes that can often be controlled with a combination of diet exercise and oral medication Ev ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least times in addition to giving himself at least or injections of insulin Jus t think of it at least times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee dle to manage his disease I dont know about you but I am a wimp if I ha ve to get a shot just once every few years and I cant even begin to imagin e what it must be like to stick yourself over times in just one week B ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week it is every day of every we ek for the rest of his life until a cure is found Diabetics can never take a break from their disease It requires constant management of their food intake monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the proper amount of insulin If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead to kidney disease or failure blindness heart disease amputations among other complications I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort s with the JDRF walk again this year I am serving on the steering committ ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo r this terrible disease I am doing this to support Mike but I also have a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure My husban d has adultonset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to diabetes and diabetesrelated diseases several years ago In addition I have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi s year It would mean a lot to me and to Mike to have support from the p eople in our Enron Global Markets organization as well as people from prev ious groups we have worked with along with other friends throughout Enron Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak e this opportunity to say thank you very much For those of you that have not yet signed up please consider one of the following three opportunities that are available to give your support to this important effort Team Leader The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the collecting

Practicum Sponsorship Importance Low Billy and Traci I think I am going to decline the opportunity to sponsor this practicum at UT since they need a commitment from us to define a project topic for the students to research They have also contacted Vince Kaminski as a prospective contact so I will copy him on this decision if you approve Thanks lexi Original Message From mailto Sent Tuesday November PM To Elliott Lexi Cc Warner Traci Subject RE UT MBA Energy Finance Practicum Sponsorship Importance Low Lexi For CEFER trustees there is no financial commitment required to sponsor a practicum The only potential expense would be to cover travel expenses for the team if you want them to make their presentation in person to management in Houston The main commitment we need is a person who will define a project topic for the team and be available for periodic conference calls throughout the semester The project sponsor should help guide the team in their research and provide any internal company data or other contacts within the company who may have information relevant to the topic If you feel that a nondisclosure agreement is necessary due the nature of the project topic you may request that the students sign one Dr Ronn is the faculty advisor for each team so students use him as a point of reference as well Some potential benefits of sponsoring a practicum include Additional exposure to MBA students interested in pursuing careers in energy The project sponsor will get a close look at a handful of students in action mostly st year MBAs and can identify potential target recruits for internships or fulltime hires later on Free research Depending on how you structure the project the students results and presentation should be useful to your organization For example I did a practicum with El Paso last year and we studied their use of Master Limited Partnerships as a vehicle for their midstream business We were able to research in depth some questions they wanted to answer but didnt have the time to do themselves Our research confirmed some of their hunches and management was very pleased with the results The level of interest in practicums among st year students is quite high compared to last year over students responded so far So we would be excited to have Enron as a sponsor this year If you would like to sponsor more than team we would certainly welcome that as well I have attached the original practicum document with some more details in case you do not have a copy Let me know if you have any other questions I can

Nov Subject Dilbert Newsletter Dilbert Newsletter To Dogberts New Ruling Class DNRC From Scott Adams Date November Highlights Scotts Patriotic Duty Boss and Coworker Quotes Holiday Gift Ideas True Tales of Induhviduals DNRC Update There are people in the DNRC each more attractive generous and intelligent than those who do not read the free Dilbert Newsletter Maybe thats a coincidence but Im starting to doubt it My Patriotic Duty Ive been wondering about the best way to offer my patriotic services in this time of global conflict I dont think Id be a good candidate for Special Ops Id be the one with the wheeled carryon bag saying Hey guys I have sand in my shoe Is anyone else hungry Can I use my flashlight now Im already donating money to patriotic causes and I bought some plastic flags made in China but I felt I needed to do more Then it hit me There is one patriotic duty for which I have prepared my entire life dehumanizing the enemy In a sense thats been my fulltime job for years I just need to replace the word management with Taliban So lets get started Ive been trying to figure out the Talibans longterm strategy and I think I got it Theyre trying to reverse evolution Their uncontrolled body hair is a good start Living in caves was an obvious step too The hard part was eliminating any trace of intelligence in the children But theyve made great strides in that area Have you seen the video of the Taliban schools where the little kids squat on the floor and rock back and forth chanting all day No math no social studies just rocking and chanting For PE they use sticks to whack stuffed dummies labeled Bush and Blair Im not sure how they know how to spell Bush and Blair On any given morning theyre probably whacking dummies labeled Tqwft and Upxpgt but its a good aerobic workout either way Just for fun ask yourself what part of the Taliban curriculum could NOT be accomplished by for example a monkey Rocking back and forth Chanting Beating a dummy with a stick Even if a monkey only got a D in chanting he would still graduate with honors from a Taliban school thanks to his high overall grades in rocking and whacking As I write this our generals are trying to figure out how to get the Taliban out of their caves Theyre running sophisticated war game scenarios and calculating risks and gathering intelligence I have one word for them bananas I dont want my patriotic words misconstrued as ethnic or religious insults As soon as the evildoers stop doing evil I am willing to promote them to fullfledged Induhviduals and insult them on equal footing with everyone else who doesnt read the Dilbert Newsletter Now that weve dehumanized the Taliban lets get on to the important work of dehumanizing our bosses coworkers and family members Induhvidual Confusion Some topics seem to confuse Induhviduals more than others For example they seem to have special trouble with concepts involving wildlife vision and their own pants See for yourself in these true quotes from Induhvidual bosses and Coworkers submitted by DNRC members A VP was speaking at a meeting and said Well you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him crap Someone up front said Thats drinkcant make him drink To which the VP said Thats stupid In the kingdom of the blind the oneeyed horse is king A coworker once said Looks like hes thrown a wrench in the monkeyworks A twoprawn approach is necessary Here is a mangled expression the CIO at our company told me the other day We were discussing an issue we both agreed upon and he said I was preaching to the blind He wont last hes just a flash in the pants One of the employees called in to say that she couldnt come to work because she had to have an autopsy My boss was telling a very involved story about something that happened to him He leaned back nonchalantly and offered as a philosophical summary Sometimes fact is stranger than truth Its a catch Our former boss suffered from the excessive use of mixed metaphors An alltime howler was the day we asked him what his plans were to ensure success for a campaign and his reply was Dont worry Ive got an ace up my hole At a management meeting my CEO said Our company is like a living orgasm Now thats what I call job satisfaction I overheard a manager congratulating an Induhvidual on having achieved a goal The Induhvidual replied It was nothing You planted the seed and I ran with it In a meeting a coworker of mine referred to the carrot at the end of the tunnel We are going to be shooting from the seat of our pants on this one These all came from the same boss Vision is in the eyes of the beholder Part of the verbiage is a language thing Eventually I want it now Its not that kind of zero There are a lot of areas for efficiency reductions In the last year youve turned around When a highpowered agent of the company walked into the lunch room our secretary remarked to our group that she couldnt stand him because he was so egotesticle One of my coworkers spit coffee out of his nose which just added to the moment I think you might have hit the nail on the button caught between a rock and a wet spot And my nomination for scariest thing a boss ever said I was thinking about you in the shower this morning and I thought of a name for you IMVironment on Yahoo Get the downloadable IM chat environment for Yahoo featuring the Dilbert characters at Holiday

permanently You can see the experimental strips at comicsplop Let me know what you think True Tales of Induhviduals Here now more true tales of Induhviduals as submitted by members of the DNRC The story in your last newsletter about the kid named Ampersand reminded me of another version I heard recently One of my relatives met a woman who wanted to call her kid LATRINE It took me an hour to stop laughing long enough to ask if anybody had pointed out what a latrine is They had She was apparently still intent on using it When I received my new credit card it had the number two after my name instead of Roman numeral II as it should have indicating that my name is the same as my fathers I called the banks customer service number and asked that their records be changed to use the Roman numeral two II instead of the number two The customer service rep said Im sorry sir My computer doesnt have Roman numerals I just went to see the Cirque du Soleil During one performance where a man and woman were flying around by having scarves under their arms attached to this huge wheel thing in the air while doing complicated acrobatics at the same time an Induhvidual behind me said to her companion That must take a lot of practice At my bookstore a customer returned three of Shakespeares books because The DARN things are in the form of PLAYS At the grocery store the checkout woman scanned all of my items then picked up the rubber divider and looked it over for the bar code so she could scan it She asked Do you know how much this is I said Ive changed my mind I dont think Ill buy that today She said Okay I paid her and left Dilbert Fodder Whats bugging you about your job Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves devious strategies frustrations of dealing with others conflicting objectives unintended management consequences and of course my favorite idiot bosses And I love True Tales of

Coms Access Point Avayas Access Server Ciscos Aironet access point and Access Control Server and Colubris CN Last time we looked at the Cisco and Colubris products This time we check out Coms and Avayas wares Coms Access Point is a welldesigned product It features a twoposition wireless access point with a flip antenna as well as a retractable XJack antenna on its wireless network interface card NIC The XJack lets you store the antenna in the NIC when not in use keeping it in your laptop during transportation Coms Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Ciscos Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol LEAP One benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the number of simultaneous users from to Furthermore you dont have to manually enter the bit keys The software automatically generates new keys and distributes them to the client each session This is great for encryption but you still need to provide for authentication It took only seconds to set up the access point but implementing the full range of security took a while longer Coms browserbased Configuration Management System was excellent and the HTMLbased documentation was complete and well organized In all Coms product had some neat technology Avayas wireless NIC looked familiar and thats because it was It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco But Avayas solution goes far beyond just the NIC Avayas Access Server is a slick tool for managing corporate level wireless security It includes Remote Authentication Dial In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged into the hardwired LAN And it employs automatic key generation and distribution Avayas documentation was very good with plenty of room set aside in the form of tables to record the system parameters administrators in large corporate environments should never commit to memory The Access Server manager provides the full range of management and diagnostic utilities youd expect from a

November PM To DLGAallenronworldwide Subject Overview of Investor Conference Call Today Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings In connection with the proposed transactions Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statementprospectus

Energy Committee Minutes from January rd Energy Committee Members The following members were in attendance at the January rd meeting Bruce Williamson Tina Sivinski Tim Tipton Bruce Sukaly Bob Peebler Vince Kaminski Dean Arthur Warga Praveen Kumar and Lane Sloan The handout material is attached for members that could not attend The committee viewed a TV ad for the Bauer College and a TV news story on the new AIM center and Cougar Fund The first item of business was the Partnership program The committee agreed on the following levels Trustee Partner Investor Sponsor For this year these levels would receive placements in the new Energy Certificate Programs which will start in September of this year as follows Trustee up to Partner up to Investor up to and Sponsor All members of the partnership program would be able to participate in the Learning Community programs of seminars forums and symposiums free of charge with the number of attendees and special arrangements varying depending upon the partnership level The Chairman noted that with the certificate classes beginning in September then the annual fee structure would need to align accordingly which left a funding gap for the first part of the year for the marketing costs to launch GEMI The original idea had been for the one time entrance fee in the Partnership Program to cover these costs but as you recall the committee did not favor that approach The Chairman asked the committee to provide ideas on how to fund these marketing efforts originally targeted at for this year Dr Kumar discussed three energy certificate programs to be available as Risk Management International Project Finance and Energy Accounting The courses can be fully developed for the Risk Management and Energy Accounting to start programs in September many already available The International Project Finance may require additional time because of development efforts on certain courses Dr Kumar requested that the members identify people in their organizations that could give detailed feedback on the course proposals so we are assured they fit the needs of the Energy community We will also begin discussions with Energy committee members on what level of participation your forsee for your company Dr Kumar noted that the BS and MS programs would be underway but less of an issue for course development as students would not be taking these more energy focused courses until junior and senior years He said that specialized training programs seemed to be of high interest and more activity than originally anticipated The chairman covered the feedback on the seminars forums and conferences There was real interest in seminars and forums but committee members did not recommend pursuing conferences at this time The plan would be to have in steady state seminars per year which would be for large audiences with a featured speaker It was noted that the venue would be an important consideration to attract appropriate audiences Various suggestions were given on topics of interest with an overall view that the presentations should be practical and of high quality The committee agreed that a reasonable fee should be charged to non members of the partnership program The feedback on the forums was that they should be smaller more focused groups with different formats depending upon the subject matter The thought was that they could address overarching issues integrating energy and service sector considerations Non members would not participate but selected student participation was seen as valuable A new concept of symposiums was introduced based on discussion with various committee members The idea of a symposium was to bring together important spokespeople and other key participants on a topic of high interest to the Energy community The Bauer College would provide a coordinating role to address the issue with the objective of gaining input on all fronts Dr Kumar noted that there had been various discussion with members around current topics emanating from the Enron collapse such as clearing house and credit risk considerations The committee was quite enthused that an imporant event could be created but it needed to be very carefully thought out as to topic and the management of the process including the media It was discussed that if the Bauer College wanted to sponsor such an event then it would need to provide a project manager Committee member companies would need to provide assistanceadvice particularly on coordinating the media Dr Kumar will be sending out an email to get your input Then Dean Warga would make a decision on whether to pursue such a significant event which could be a great launch vehicle for GEMI but also carried a series of risks Next Dr Kumar discussed briefly the trading center noting that the key issue was endowment funding before any significant activity could take place The college was continuing to think through the content and integration with other aspects of GEMI the AIMs investment center etc The Chairman then discussed GEMIs overall marketing image There was some fine tuning of the proposal providing further clarity and emphasis of key aspects of GEMI but in general a high consensus on the desired image contained in the attachment After the dialogue on the symposium which would be a major marketing effort in an of itself the discussion on external and internal promotion was tabled til next meeting The chairman noted that there would probably be a need for a two tier approach if the symposium effort was pursued The major focus initially being on the symposium then coupled with a growing effort on the overall GEMI marketing over the next several months The last item was the competitive assessmentrelationship with other universites and organizations where the chairman discussed the current approach and principles in the attachment This received good support from the committee The committee members recommended the next meeting to occur in six weeks I will send out a separate email on possible dates for you to consider Best Regards Lane GEMIJanRppt

these are great The boss of a big company needed to call one of his employees about an urgent problem with one of the main computers He dialed the employees home phone number and was greeted with a childs whispering Hello Feeling put out at the inconvenience of having to talk to a youngster the boss asked Is your daddy home Yes whispered the small voice May I talk with him the man asked To the surprise of the boss the small voice whispered No Wanting to talk with an adult the boss asked Is your mommy there Yes came the answer May I talk with her Again the small voice whispered No Knowing that it was not likely that a young child would be left at home alone the boss decided he would just leave a message with the person who should be there watching over the child Is there any one there besides you the boss asked the child Yes whispered the child a policeman Wondering what a cop would be doing at his employees home the boss asked May I speak with the policeman No hes busy whispered the child Busy doing what asked the boss Talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman came the whispered answer Growing concerned and even worried as he heard what sounded like a helicopter through the earpiece on the phone the boss asked What is that noise A hellocopper answered the whispering voice What is going on there asked the boss now alarmed In an awed whispering voice the child answered The search team just landed the hellocopper Alarmed concerned and more than just a little frustrated the boss asked What are they searching for Still whispering the young voice replied along with a muffled giggle Me Never Ask Your Child a Question Too Many Times Have you ever asked your child a question too many times Here is an account from one woman My threeyearold son had a lot of problems with potty training and I was on him constantly One day we stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands It was very busy with a full dining room While enjoying my taco I smelled something funny so of course I checked my sevenmonthold daughter who was clean Then I realized that Matt had not asked to go potty in a while so I asked and he said No I kept thinking Oh Lord that child has had an accident and I dont have any clothes with me Then I said Matt are you sure you did not have an accident No he replied I just knew that he must have had because the smell was getting worse So I asked one more time Matt did you have an accident This time he jumped up yanked down his pants bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled See Mom ITS JUST BOTTOM BURPS While people nearly choked to death on their tacos he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if nothing happened I of course was mortified Some kind elderly people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me for the best laugh theyd ever had And one particular fouryear old prayed And forgive us our trash baskets as we forgive those who put trash in our baskets A little boy was overheard praying Lord if you cant make me a better boy dont worry about it Im having a real good time like I am Fun in Church From James Dobson One Sunday a young boy was acting up during the morning worship hour The parents did their best to maintain some sense of order in the pew but were losing the battle Finally the father swung the little fellow up on his shoulder and walked sternly up the aisle on his way out to deliver some thoroughly deserved discipline As they exited the church auditorium the little one lifted his head and called to the congregation Yall pray for me A Sunday school teacher asked her little children as they were on the way to church service And why is it necessary to be quiet in church One bright little girl replied Because people are sleeping The preacher moved briskly about the platform as he preached emphatically Because he was wired for sound with a lapel microphone he jerked the mike cord as he went When he moved to one side he got wound up in the cord and nearly tripped before jerking free After several circles and jerks a little girl in the third pew leaned toward her mother and whispered If he gets loose will he hurt us Sixyear old Angie and her fouryear old brother Joel were sitting together in church Joel giggled sang and talked out loud Finally his big sister had had enough Youre not supposed to talk out loud in church Why Whos going to stop me Joel asked Angie pointed to the back of the church and said See those two men standing by the door Theyre hushers After the church service a little boy told the pastor When I grow up Im going to give you some money Well thank you the pastor replied But why Because my daddy says youre one of the poorest preachers weve ever had A father was at the beach with his children when the fouryearold son ran up to him grabbed his hand and led him to the shore where a seagull lay dead in the sand Daddy what happened to him the son asked He died and went to Heaven the dad replied The boy thought a moment and then said Did God throw him back down

yThe Dabhol Power Company DPC declined to give details about Mr Lays vi sit We dont want to comment said its spokesman Jimmy Mogal Mr Lays v isit deserves special significance especially when the Maharashtra State E lectricity Board MSEB has stopped power purchase from DPC since May a fter issuing a notice to rescind its power purchase agreement with DPC MSE B has also got shot in the arm when the Mumbai high court dismissed a writ petition filed by the DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Elect ricity Regulatory Commission to adjudicate upon its dispute and difference with MSEB

energy major En ron Godbole Review Committee has recommended outright privatisation of the lossmaking state electricity boards distribution network and generation unit in the second part of its report to be submitted on July The repo rt outlines path breaking reforms which not only suggests restructuring of MSEB but also makes its clear that its onceaverygood board will be des troyed if it continues as a government body official sources said here o n Sunday The report would be submitted to the state chief minister Vilasra o Deshmukh on Tuesday morning sources said The committee has recommended that MSEBs government ownership should be dissolved however the control of transmission network should rest with it MSEBs current assets are c lose to worth Rs crore and once Cabinet approves the proposal follow ing submission of the report process like inviting tenders from private pa rties may be taken up officials said According to the report the interested companies would have to infuse capi tal investment in the distribution and generation networks with an increase d rate of return at about per cent sources explained The plus pag es report draws a detailed road map for the need to privatise MSEB a diffe rent model from what was implemented in other states sources added The so urces said experiences of Orissa Haryana Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh wer e closely studied by the panel and then it decided to recommend this model of privatisation The mantra of privatisation of only distribution network has failed all over the country official sources said The report has em phasised on creating distribution network zones in the states urban and ru ral areas respectively bids for which could be invited for they said Th e rural zones are very crucial for us sources said adding the report re commends that these should be handed over to any private party be it a co operative like the Pravara Electricity or a nongovernmental organisation w ith a clear cut subsidy payout The committee has also worked out a subsid y model which would intersperse with a special transmisssion charge levi ed by the state government after privatisation to the companies official s ources said The report suggests that the transmission company should levy a surcharge over an above the billing chargs which would be used for reco vering the crosssubsidies the sources said The aim to privatise only di stribution and generation is to facilitate pure trade of power and avoid an y kind of other interferences mainly political the sources added PTI MID DAY Monday July Dabhol employees sure company will pull out Deepak Lokhande When Enron Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay arrives in India today to tr y to renegotiate the Dabhol power project he will find that his employees are certain the company will pull out of the venture Everyday the govern ment adopts a new stance We have been given an indication that the company will pull out said a senior officer working with Dabhol Power Company D PC Enron s Indian subsidiary When the company was ready to renegotiat e the state government was adamant that it wouldnt hold any discussions Now when they are pressing for renegotiations and a reduction in tariff t he company is not willing Lay will meet Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpaye e and apprise him of the state government s changing stands he said The atmosphere at the Veldoor plant near Dabhol is one of gloom Recently sev eral thousand workers were laid off when the plant was forced to shut down because the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB refused to purchase electricity MSEB claimed that DPC did not fulfil conditions of the Power P urchase Agreement PPA There used to be labourers working at the plant either on the construction of the second phase which is per cen t complete or for the first phase generating electricity Today the plant looks like a smashaan cemetery Workers keep asking each other who is th e next to go It is sad he saidTill recently the main gate of the plant would be thronged by daily wage workers Today there are hardly any Even those having permanent jobs with DPC are not sure if their jobs are safe Stories of how even senior officers were shown the door in an unceremonious manner are making the rounds The other day a very senior officer was to ld that he was not required any more By the time he reached his residence provided by the company his phone lines were cut He had to go out and pho ne relatives and friends He was asked to collect his dues the next day On arriving at the gate he was in for another shock He was asked to get him self a visitor s pass with restricted access It was shocking said a con tractor MID DAY Sunday July Villages suffer with Enron shutting shop Enron is going back and going back with it are the riches it brought to Gu hagar and Dabhol talukas Most hit are traders at Shringartali Tali a ma rket that is km away from Veldoor where Enron built its plus mw th ermal power plant The crash here has been more severe than the dotcom cras h as business volumes have reduced by more than per cent and the real estate market has hit rock bottomSays Uday Deolekar who owns a building m aterial shop at Tali It used to be Diwali time while the project was on On Sundays the fourlane road would throb with buyers The party was over however with the state Government pulling the plug on Enron Gloom took over as workers started leaving the project site around February There has been little business activity since thenDeolekar used to run a small shop of panbeedi and groceries till about eight years ago when Enron came to D abhol Construction activity picked up in the area and Deolekar with his b rotherinlaw Mohan Sansare seized the opportunity and started supplying b uilding material Business flourished and the Sansares took over a plot of land to open four more shops Sitting at one of them Deolekar is waiting f or customers todayVillagers in Tali and nearby areas wanted to refurbish their houses to accommodate paying guests coming in hordes There was great demand for accommodation and hardly any supply While bluecollar workers were happy with dormitorytype arrangements whitecollar officials wanted oneroom kitchen attached bath type apartments Many villagers started co nstructing lodges and boarding houses to cater to demand Little did they r ealise that the party would have come to an end in any case once the constr uction was over says Deolekar However his brotherinlaw Mohan is happy that Enron is going back They were quite arrogant They may have brought money to this area but they als o brought all the vices booze gambling and what not Enron will go back cash flow will dry up but these vices will now remain with us forever he says He wants an Indian company to take over the plant and run it Naseem shet owner of Kasam Mohammed Memon shop is one of the biggest traders in Tali I used to work for the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP When Enron offi cers came here in they stayed in my guesthouses I was pressurised by the party then to break off my ties with them but I told myself I must ke ep politics out of business I am happy I did that See how BJP leaders are now backing the project to the hilt I received bulk orders and business s hot up Last three years were crazy Now we are back to square one cateri ng to around buyers from nearby villages he says The Memons rented out an entire building accommodating around nine persons for Rs a month during boom time Now the building does not have any takers even for Rs per month The Memons had also started a transpor t business seeing the vast money involved Dabhol Power Company DPC used to pay Rs per month to hire a Tata Sumo Our drivers started their own business After the crash they have come back to us begging for Rs amonth job But now I cant afford them he says Nandu Bartakke who owns a grocery shop in Guhagar recalls how Rs per kg rice would be term ed as expensive by locals After they got jobs at DPC however their li festyles changed They wanted Surti Kolam rice which costs Rs per kg I f I said it was costly they would tell me they couldnt digest the Rs p er kg rice They forgot that they grew on that rice he says Most of thes e locals who had suddenly become rich with their Rs amonth jobs wi th DPC are yet to get over the crash Bartakke claims traders from Chiplun market which is km away from DPC site reaped rich dividends They kn ew what an industry requires They have been catering to MIDCs industrial estate at Lote Parshuram for years now They carefully invested their money and focussed on what DPC needed Hardly any of them ever indulged in tempo rary markets such as real estate or transport he saysAgrees Shailesh War watkar a shopowner in Chiplun market We concentrated on chillar items s uch as plastic bags ball pens and stuff like that It was astonishing to s ee DPC paying Rs for used gunny bag otherwise priced at paise in t he market DPC always wanted huge quantities in real quick time and they p aid any price that was quoted Not all have made money though For Hari Babu of S N Instrumentation the e xperience has come as a shocker His company was awarded a subcontract by PunjLloyd Babu came in February and by April DPC was sailing in troubled waters Since midJune Babu has hardly had any work He has sent back p eople from his team and is awaiting further instructions from his companys office in Kolkata We will sue them How can they a terminate six months contract just like that says a livid Babu But he knows the futility of his anger We will sue PunjLloyd PunjLloyd will slap case against Sansc ra the French company Sanscra will start legal proceedings against Bechte l Bechtel will file suit against DPC and DPC will go in arbitration agains t Maharashtra Government Its a long and neverending chain DPC auctioning jeeps computers at throwaway prices Dabhol Power Company DPC and several other companies who were involved in the setting up of Dabhol Power Project have started auctioning fourwheel ers computers and are likely to put on sale refrigerators and airconditio nersThe buzz in the area is vehicles like Tata Sumos Mahindra Armada Com mander and Jeeps are available at throwaway prices They are selling vehic les kilo ke hisaab se I heard a jeep was available for just Rs sa id Warwatkar Indeed there were a few vehicles put on sale at the site car rying a price tag of Rs for Commanders But the tag also mentio ned of major breakdown of engine as known defects Most other vehicles were available at a minimum bid price of Rs onwards and looked in bad sh ape after a rough use in difficult terrain Bodywork was required in most c ases Locals however believe its still a good buy The goods are however are offered to employees first who bid their price Some of them have started selling these goods at higher prices to others Naseem Memon bought a Mahindra Marshall for Rs lakh through one of th e employees who had bought it at company auction and immediately got an of fer of Rs lakh Memon is not selling it just now I will repair it an d I am sure it will fetch at least Rs lakh to Rs lakh he says Th e area is flooded with buyers from Mumbai Karad Satara and Pune Shortly computers fridges and ACs will also be put on sale and DPC employees will have their hands full with requests from outsiders

think that by pure coincidence one day a chicken would back into a stick and invent the broom Maybe when the dirt builds up gradually you dont notice a problem until your house disappears I can imagine the conversation on the day they figured out what was happening Ixphalup Hey Fnorkzak be a dear and go downstairs and get my stone bowl the crude one Fnorkzak Downstairs is gone Its all dirt Ixphalup Uh oh fetch Grandpa its time to abandon the city Fnorkzak Hes downstairs most of him anyway except for the top of his head Ixphalup Hmm It sounds like I found a new bowl I like to mock the ancients but Im a bad housekeeper myself albeit not on the lost city scale Sometimes Ill lose a pencil at most a sneaker to the growing sediment layer before Im forced by the homeowners association to sell the house But Im too fastidious to lose anything big like a car or sofa Fun fact Until Mayor Giuliani cleaned up New York City the highest building was two stories tall and no one could remember

this line of reasoning Vice President Dick Cheney recently got a defibrillator to keep his heart beating He also has corrective lenses to enhance his vision He has fillings in his teeth so he can eat and he has a cell phone in his pocket Individually these items mean nothing but collectively they raise an important question How much hardware can you have attached to your body before youre technically a cyborg Im worried that Cheney is already a cyborg Without the hardware hed be a blind starving bald guy with no pulse Thats a pretty good argument for defining him as part man part machine The disturbing thing is this To whom does he pledge his allegiance machines or people If Im right within two years Cheney will be living inside a hardened mountain in Wyoming hardwired into the national missile defense grid And well all become slaves to our machine overlords Highways will be filled with humans carrying SUVs on their backs Television sets will make you dance for their amusement It wont be pretty Before you rush to label me paranoid consider who elected Cheney in the first place Sure we humans pulled the levers and poked the chads but in the end the machines did the counting and elected one of their own And youll notice that Cheney supports any policy that results in more hardware like the Star Wars missile defense shield and more oil drilling I think this is how machines reproduce First they conquer the humanoid government and then they create tax incentives to produce more machines The ants are milking the aphids and were the aphids I dont know what George W Bushs role is in all this but if you look at his recent photos youll see that he always has a little oil can with him The irony is that Al Gore lost the election largely because he looked like a robot In fact he was only an advanced android from a distant nebula sent here as a prank Anyway Im worried that somehow Cheney will get control of the Internet and BULLETINWE ARE YOUR MACHINE OVERLORDS

more truelife quotes from bosses and coworkers submitted by DNRC members During one meeting with clients my boss told them to Cut the cake a different way and go for the lowest hanging fruit I told

one boss Thats just cutting your throat to spite your face We have to be careful not to put all our apples in one cart This project is like pulling hens teeth Im being raped over the coals In a

from my sisters pointyhaired boss I dont want to throw another monkey at the wrench right now My boss was pleased that with one phone call we had killed two stones A good PHB misquote if we pass mustard At one meeting my boss said Thatll put the can amongst the worms I have a friend whose supervisor proudly proclaimed that her new car was a Honda Accordion Hunchback By the way she was the supervisor of the Customer Service department Lazy Entrepreneur comicsdilbertlazyentrepreneur The Lazy Entrepreneur feature on Dilbertcom has over brilliant ideas submitted by DNRC members I just submitted a new one that I call BIG DOG SHIELD Its a Plexiglastm shield you can use when visiting the home of someone who has a huge exuberant slobbering dog who insists on jumping and drooling all over your good clothes Youd only need the shield for the first five minutes of the visit until the dog calms down Florist shops could rent the BIG DOG SHIELD to young men on prom night when they pick up their corsages When the young man arrives at his dates house and her big slobbering dog lunges toward his rented tuxedo with forty toenails and nine pounds of wet tongue the young man can toss the corsage in the foyer and hide behind the BIG DOG SHIELD until his date is ready to go Its not the most macho way to start a date but its better than wearing slobber to the prom True Tales of Induhviduals Induhviduals continue to amaze and amuse Here are more True Tales submitted by DNRC members Actual conversation I overheard in school Induhvidual If the Eiffel tower is a bridge how come you cant drive on it Induhvidual The Eiffel tower isnt a bridge Induhvidual Yes it is You can walk across it and it has two tall block things Induhvidual The last time I was in New York it wasnt a bridge Heres a true Induhvidual story that I found in the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenska Dagbladet Four people were chosen randomly and asked if they were concerned that they might buy products produced by children Three of the four people said they think child labor is horrible and that they would never buy products made by children The fourth person missed the point entirely and said that she wouldnt buy these products since children have no feeling for quality which will result in poorer quality of the final product A few years ago as a solar eclipse approached some planetarium directors in Southern California sent out warnings to the community about the eclipse Experience shows that daytime darkness leads to accidents among Induhviduals and also they have been known to stare at the partially eclipsed sun and blind themselves Honest It really happens The planetarium received an indignant letter from a local Induhvidual She said that if an eclipse was so dangerous they never should have decided to hold one and ought to cancel it My dad always locked his keys in the car by accident He had been doing this for about a year when one day he approached my mom and said You know what Im going to leave the coat hanger in the trunk so I can unlock the car the next time this happens Our company accountant came and asked for a new power strip and I gave him one Then he asked if I could come and install it for him I told him it was pretty simple shutdown computer unplug everything remove existing strip plug in new strip plug in computer turn it on He said Really Recognizing the opportunity I said Well you also have to Telnet into the device and make sure its set for English voltage and not metric or else youll burn up the motherboard He looked confused and said Ill wait until you have time to install it I saw a lady on TV who liked to collect Nativity scenes She proudly showed off one of her favorite sets where the figures according to her description were AfricanAmerican We had a CONsultant come in to our company who helped us determine our personality types so that we could learn to work together better She uses the JungMyersBriggs Typology and one of the continuums it ranks you on is Judging versus Perceiving J vs P She paired up people who fell into the P category with people who were in the J category for an exercise in which they were supposed to try to think like the other The president of our company said he didnt understand the purpose so she tried to explain it to him You have a lot of Jness but not enough Pness Needless to say the exercise was never completed Recently the teachers contract in my school district ran out and the teachers demanded a raise Two weeks before the strike date the school board passed out an exam to all students the average grade was The school board told the teachers that this was unacceptable and there would be no raises But they offered that the teachers could get pay increases for every the average test score increased on the next test The union came back with one demand that the teachers create the tests The next test average was which the school board credited to our ability to motivate our teachers And how A couple of years ago at college I went to the library to get a signed statement that I did not have any unpaid library fines This was required to get my exam results The woman at the counter wrote down my name and student ID followed by does not have any fines at the libara She crossed off the last word and tried again with liberery then crossed that out and wrote here I wonder what she uses as her job title One day in the cafeteria at my school a girl was asking for donations for a foundation named after a boy who had a terminal illness Unfortunately the boy had recently died so she was asking us to donate money for this dead kid My Induhvidual buddy actually asked her how money could help a dead kid When she said get this It might help with the autopsy he responded Oh so they might still be able to cure him My friends sevenmonth pregnant wife was returning to her car with her threeyearold daughter after shopping in the mall The daughter wanted to play driver so Linda not her real name allowed her daughter to sit in the drivers seat The daughter insisted that Linda sit in the backseat of her fourdoor Honda After a couple of minutes of playtime Linda decided it was time to go home She tried to get out of the car but the childproof locks wouldnt let her open the back doors of the car So Linda crawled between the two front seats then crawled headfirst out to the parking Upon returning home she told her tale of woe to her husband who being the sensitive guy he is said Why didnt you roll down the window and open the door from the outside When I worked at Barnes Noble years ago I had a customer ask where we kept the largeprint audio books My teenage daughter sometimes forgets her house key and is locked out after school Her first choice of entry is to ask our neighbor to get out his ladder and climb in a window on the second floor and unlock a door Shes done this several times We get to tease her a lot about being an airhead So one day I locked myself out on the way to do errands I was in the car before I even realized I had left my keys inside So thinking of my daughters solution I asked my laughing neighbor for help Being a nice guy he obliged with his ladder climbing to the second story etc Later that day I was relating the story to my husband When I got to the part about sitting in the car without the keys he said And then you took the garage door opener out of the glove compartment and let yourself in My local supermarket recently had a campaign to raise money for the Jimmy Fund a New England charity for children with cancer At the checkout clerks asked customers if they wished to donate a dollar to the Jimmy Fund As I left the store I noticed the handlettered sign by the door Fight Children With Cancer Geez I thought dont those poor kids have it hard enough already My first year of graduate school I moved into an apartment that didnt have a smoke detector After doing some checking into state landlordtenant law I confirmed my suspicion that the landlady was required to provide us with a smoke detector so I took the issue up with the landlady My Induhvidual of a roommate was upset with me for this fearing that by rocking the boat I was going to get us kicked out of the apartment She summed up her arguments to me by saying Besides which I dont see why we even need a smoke detector Back home in Kentucky we never had a smoke detector at our house and we never once had a fire My company experienced a power outage California When all was dark several employees grabbed the flashlights that are stored in boxes in the hallway for just such an occasion One employees flashlight was very dim suggesting that the battery was not fully charged I noticed that he was repeatedly holding his hand over the front of the flashlight then pulling it away When I asked him what he was doing he explained that he was trying to build up a lot of light At Badwater Death Valley theres a sign on a rock to indicate sea level I overheard a couple of Induhviduals who were looking at the sign and talking The woman says I wonder if its the top or bottom Of the sign her husband asks No of the sea she replied Being the scientific one around the office an Induhvidual asked me if I knew about telescopes I said yes and she explained that she bought her son a telescope but she couldnt seem to get it to focus on any stars I told her to point it at houses down the street with lights and see if she could see anything She said You can use a telescope to look at things on the ground As it turns out focusing wasnt the problem It had been an overcast evening and she thought the telescope was strong enough to get through the clouds to see stars I saw this sign on a Chinese restaurant KING CRAP for I think they meant King Crab but I cant be sure A Burger King restaurant in Rome NY was advertising for Closers but the C was removed or blown away from their marquee so it read Losers Wanted I heard this from an Induhvidual standing near the Continental Divide at Yellowstone Park On which side of the Continental Divide does the water flow uphill There is a locked suggestion box in the cafeteria of my company I just found out from HR that no one has a key for it My wife manages a convenience store Yesterday a mother and daughter maybe two years old came into the store When the mother was ready to go to the register she called to her daughter Ampersand Ampersand Lets go honey My wife couldnt believe what she heard so she asked the customer Whats your daughters name and the Induhvidual replied Ampersand I dont know what it means but I think its a lovely girls name With the recent and spectacular downturn of the stock market there has been a lot of concern in the mutual fund industry as assets under management shrink While we havent experienced layoffs the environment has been eroded to the point where many people have left the company of their own accord In an effort to bolster morale the marketing people and HR teamed up and delivered bunches of those sportingevent foam hands with the index finger sticking up to proclaim our company as Number one But it seems that the legal

Midwest ISOs proposal to become an RTO while rejectin g a similar plan from the Alliance Companies to form the Alliance RTO In reversing prior policy FERC concluded that the ARTO proposal lacked suffi cient scope and size to exist as a standalone RTO and told the Alliance C ompanies to explore how their business plan can be accommodated within the MISO structure Allowing two RTOs in the Midwest would be a secondbest solution that would compromise customers interests FERC stated In related developments FERC also approved International Transmission Com panys request to transfer operational control of its transmission facilit ies to MISO and accepted an agreement between MISO and International Trans mission that would allow the company to be an independent transmission com pany that would share certain RTO functions with MISO Finally in a relat ed docket FERC granted in part National Grids request for a declaratory or der that it is not a market participant but dismissed the Alliance Compan ies business plan without prejudice as unneeded given the other Alliance o rder thus nullifying Grids proposal to manage ARTO More detailed RTO su mmary provided below FERC Delays Implementation of New Market Power Rules FERC announced that it would delay the effects of its November market p ower orders In FERCs December order it recognized the Alliance of En ergy Suppliers filing requesting FERC to vacate or stay the effects of it s market power orders and initiate a rulemaking proceeding to allow for co mments by affected industry participants as basis for its change in policy action We should claim this as a victoryfor FERC has announced an upco ming technical conference to discuss said orders and allow industry to voi ce its concerns over the implications of such measures on the competitive wholesale markets Although a date for this technical conference has not b een announced Chairman Wood said that details of the conference will be r eleased in a notational order FERC has also delayed implementation of cer tain aspects of the new Supply Margin Assessment SMA market power screen test FERC Sets Schedule for Electric Market Design Industry Told to Select Who lesale Market Standards Body or FERC Will Do So FERC outlined a schedule for a rulemaking in the Electric Market Design do cket and announced the release of a staff white paper to serve as a strawm an piece for continued collaboration with interested parties on standardiz ed electric market design FERC stated it expected to host industry worksh ops in early tentatively set for January and February t o further develop ideas on market standardization and issue a NOPR in March The NOPR would be followed by additional workshops in April and May to discuss NOPR inclusions and workshop developments Written comments on the NOPR and workshop progress will also be due in May A final rule is e xpected to be issued in July Although FERC staff recognized that thi s was a very ambitious schedule the FERC presenter said they wanted to g et done before summer break Meanwhile FERC said interested parties should evaluate NAESB NERC and a lternative proposals for an organization to develop wholesale electric ind ustry business practice and communication standards and agree on a single consensus industrywide organization to develop these standards by March The Order indicated that should industry not agree on a single organization by that date FERC would either choose an organization or ins titute a proceeding to develop the necessary standards Commissioner Brownell reiterated her dismay and disbelief with industrys lag in progress lets get this done I cant believe were still debating the who The other three Commissioners indicated their general support for the Order Commissioner Breathitt believes that this ANOPR proc ess is working well because it gives industry something to coalesce aroun d Breathitt was also in favor of industry answering the question of how much standardization do we need and how much do we need to leave to creati vity and innovation Chairman Wood concluded his remarks saying the GIGANOPR is on its way The staff white paper covering these issues is available from the FERC web site at electricrtomrktstrctcommentsmrktstrctco nceptPDF FERC Largely Reaffirms Prior Western Market Price Mitigation Orders Modif ies Price Cap to Account for NW Winter Peaking Concerns In a broad rehearing order that addresses a wide range of issues related t o California and the western energy markets FERC generally denied reheari ng requests and reaffirmed earlier decisions on pricing and price mitigati on measures The order addresses rehearing and clarification requests for the Commissions August November December and December o rders along with its March June and July refund and price mitigation orders Among adjustments made to previous orders FERC modified the scope of price mitigation and mustoffer requirements especially as applied to governmental sellers and cooperatives eliminated the undersche duling penalty established in the December Order and provided an oppor tunity for certain entities to submit evidence that the refund methodology results in a revenue shortfall FERC also modified and provided clarifica tions on setting of the mitigated marketclearing price In particular FERC clarified that government sellers and cooperatives are excluded from price mitigation as its applies to bilateral transactions outside the ISO spot market and also with the mustrun requirement outside of California units operating outside of California may set the mitigated marketclearin g price the mitigated marketclearing price is to be set by the proxy price of the last unit dispatched rather than the lower of the proxy price or the actu al bid of the marginal unit and generators subject to the mustoffer requirement should be able to rec over their costs for complying with the ISOs instructions to keep their u nits at minimum load status and that the ISO must pay these costs regard less of whether the ISO buys the power Modification to WesternWide Price Mitigation Measures In a separate order FERC responded to industry recommendation from its Oc tober technical conference and modified the price mitigation methodolog y for spot market transactions for the westwide market for the winter sea son FERC stated that changes would support continued price stability and balance in the western markets The changes were called for in part FERC said since the area the California ISO serves is a summer peaking system and a large portion of the state Western Systems Coordinating Council consists of winter peaking systems The changes extend from the date of the order through April at which time the summer mitigation measure s will be reinstated Most notably the new cap levels take into account f luctuation in natural gas prices Modifications to previous mitigation measures are raises cap level from to continues to apply percent credit worthiness adder sets February as date that final outstanding payments be made to West ern sellers of power FERCs objective through these order was to allow FERC and affected partie s in the West to move forward on calculating any refunds owed and to provi de greater rate certainty and stability to the market according to the co mmissioners More information on the California and western market changes is available in FERCs press release newspressreleasescalifde cPDF and the full order electricbulkpowerel PDF both available in pdf format from FERCs websi te RTO Developments MISO Approved As Nations First RTO In approving MISOs RTO application as the nations first RTO FERC said tha t it complies with the vision and requirements of Order No in parti cular the requirement that an RTO be of sufficient scope FERC cited favor ably MISOs announced merger with the Southwest Power Pool and said that it was particularly encouraged by MISOs planned accommodation of flexible bu siness plans and innovation as well as its considerable geographic span For the most part FERC found that MISO satisfied the four characteristics for an RTO independence scope and configuration operational authority a nd shortterm reliability as well as key functions FERC did however di rect MISO to submit a number of revisions FERC found MISOs independence satisfactory in most respects but said that transmission owners cannot be permitted to have veto privileges on filings that affect pricing FERC co nditioned MISOs RTO status on modification of the MISO Agreement to give it the authority to propose rates terms and conditions of transmission se rvice under the MISO tariff On the scope and regional configuration chara cteristic FERC told MISO to present recommendations within days addres sing the question of its eastern seam prior to the integration of the Alli ance Companies into MISO FERC also indicated that MISO should participate in its recently announced rulemaking proceeding to standardize market des ign rules However FERC said MISO should also address certain congestion management issues prior to implementation of standardized market rules F ERC also directed additional changes to ensure the independence of the mar ket monitor and required modification of the planning framework to reflect that it will consider all market perspectives and to accommodate thirdpa rty investment construction and ownership of transmission facilities Alliance Companies Told to Work Under MISO FERC Finds IRCA Efforts Insuff icient Citing in part strong support from a majority of the Midwest state regulat ors for a single Midwest RTO and Alliance RTO ARTOs failure to achieve t he necessary close coordination with MISO FERC concluded that the ARTO lac ked sufficient scope to exist as a standalone RTO FERC expressed confide nce however that the Alliance Companies desire to be a viable forprof it transmission business can be accommodated under the MISO Appendix I str ucture FERC emphasized the importance of fostering RTO development design ed to provide a seamless and robust market for millions of customers Allo wing two RTOs in the Midwest would be a secondbest solution that would co mpromise customers interests concluded FERC The Commission ordered the Alliance Companies to file a status report on their efforts to join MISO w ithin days In the Order FERC acknowledged the significant time and ex pense incurred by the Alliance Companies to date adding that it would con sider proposals for recovery of all prudently incurred costs International Transmission Approved As ITC Under MISO In a related order FERC said that International Transmission Company Int ernational Transmission a subsidiary of DTE Energy could join the new RT O as an independent transmission company that will be able to pursue innov ative business strategies International Transmission proposes to maintain and develop transmission while turning over to the RTO such functions as congestion management and curtailments tariff administration and securit y coordination DTE Energy has indicated its intention to sell Internation al Transmission to a third party FERC gave preliminarily approval for the divestiture of the transmission facilities FERC however deferred rulin g on several contested RTOtransco function issues until International Tra nsmission becomes truly independent National Grid Meets Independence Criterion as FERC Dismisses Alliance Com panies ARTO Business Plan FERC granted in part and deferred in part a National Grid proposal to mana ge the RTO transmission system FERC found that National Grid is not a mar ket participant by virtue of its retail obligations in New York and New En gland FERC directed the Alliance Companies to explore how their business plan including National Grids proposal could be accommodated within the MISO RTO FERC expressed its intent to provide more guidance on this matte r in future proceedings General Discussion Signaling a deference to Midwestern state commissions Chairman Wood said we have brought order out of an array of various and sundry efforts in the middle of the country Its a good Christmas gift to the nation Wood cautioned that the orders findings are based on what best serves the public interest in the Midwest and that FERCs actions should not be const rued to prejudge other types of RTOs in other parts of the country includ ing a structure in which a forprofit transmission company could be an umb rella RTO For her part Commissioner Breathitt dissented on the Alliance Order stating that after the Alliance Companies have already spent over million in startup costs and its plans were given tentative approval b y FERC over the past two and a half years she saw no reason to abruptly c hange direction and deny Alliance Companies an opportunity to implement th eir business model The Commission has not done all it could or should do to allow Alliance to develop Breathitt said Addressing the nearunanimo us support among Midwest regulators for a single Midwest RTO Commissioner Massey stated we are heeding that advice and moving forward accordingly For his part the Alliance Order did not represent a change of position he said noting that he has long favored forcing a consolidation of the tw o RTO proposals Additional details on these orders can be found in the FE RC press release which is available from FERCs website at govnewspressreleasesmwestxpressrelPDF PJM PJM West Denied on a Procedural Basis Chairman Wood in meeting discussion stated that the rejection was on a pr ocedural issue only with a delay required only because of provisions pend ing in other dockets In a twopage letter order FERC rejected the reques t of PJM and PJM West to integrate but Chairman Wood assured the parties that FERC remained committed to the expansion effort and wants to see it m ove forward very quickly All indications are that once the other provision s have been addressed FERC would be ready to move forward on the PJM West effort FERC Directs PJM To amend Tariffs to Include New Oversight Measures FERC terminated its investigation into allegations that PECO Energy Company had operated its transmission system in a manner that illegally advantage d a corporate affiliate FERC staff indicated that the record in the proce eding did not establish a violation of the Federal Power Act or FERCs Sta ndards of Conduct sufficient to warrant further enforcement proceedings an d that further investigations into the matter were not warranted or necess ary Simultaneously FERC accepted a report from PJM outlining a series of improvements to its current procedures for reporting of transmission outa ges and the rating of transmission facilities FERC directed PJM to file a mendments to its tariffs to reflect the new procedures Commenting on the swift resolution of the matter Chairman Wood noted the importance of lift ing the cloud of an investigation promptly when the evidence warrants it Staff Reports High Cost of Congestion Need RTO Congestion Management Mor e Investment A presentation of a FERC staff report on electric transmission constraints detailed the high costs of congestion and suggested that building more tr ansmission would likely lower overall consumer costs The report which FE RC staff acknowledged suffered from certain data limitations found that b ottlenecks in the transmission system cost consumers more than billion over the past two summers The report also demonstrates the need for stron g congestion management systems at RTOs FERC staff said FERC commissione rs commended staff on the presentation and seemed supportive of the conclu sion that building additional infrastructure would bring benefits to energ y consumers FERC staff also noted that a parallel DOE National Grid Study should be completed and released before the end of the year The staff presentation is available in MS PowerPoint on the FERC Discussi on Papers page at calendarcommissionmeetingsDiscus sionpapershtm Additional Commission Action FERC Issues Accounting NOPR with Question to Industry FERC issued an accounting NOPR Docket No RM seeking comment on whet her to require unregulated energy marketers and traders to disclose holdin gs in derivative financial contracts used to limit risks of volatile price swings in energy purchases and sales Chairman Wood said he looks to indu stry to answer the question and tell FERC that the current exemption and b lanket waivers and authorizations should remain or not Commissioner Breat hitt pointed out that the current entities that must comply with reporting requirements of derivative activity are not major players in the derivati ve markets but the openended question if answered in the affirmative w ould place burdensome requirements on a sector of the market ie power ma rketers that most delve in that arena Chairman Wood said that he might b e in agreement with possible responses from industry that say that maybe t hese processes are for another agency to do eg SEC CFTC etc Separately the NOPR proposes changes to the Uniform System of Accounts U SA to record transactions required under Financial Accounting Standards Bo ard FASB Statement Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and E quity Securities FASB Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income and Statement Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitie s The NOPR also proposes changes in the annual reports to the Commission including the Form to conform to recent actions by FASB to tighten dis closure rules The proposal follows up Commission guidance issued in Augus t for using the existing USA for recording transactions covered by th ese FASB Statements All four commissioners endorsed the NOPR Chairman Wood said the new rules would focus more on providing transparency to investors than broadening F ERCs regulatory authority Commissioner Breathitt commented that the new rule would seek to collect annual data not give FERC the ability to acti vely monitor the complicated transactions We would be obtaining a yearl y snapshot of derivative positions Breathitt said I think this is a go od step FERC Staff Provides Update on Development of Standardized Interconnection Policy FERC staff reviewed the process and progress of the collaborative efforts to develop a standardized generation interconnection policy While interco nnection documents were filed on December th as required by the ANOPR p articipants noted that the documents remain a work in progress Participan ts had requested and FERC granted on December an extension of time to file the consensus documents to January and to January to file fina l comments in

earnings estimates ratings and price targets for a number of our companies who are long power In all we are lowering ratings on seven companies price targets on thirteen and earnings estimates on sixteen This follows our call Power Curve published May where we established a more cautious outlook for Power Producers versus Energy Merchants Since our last Power Curve analysis on May we have seen the continued deterioration of both forward power prices and spark spreads June was the first period in which we have seen yearyear declines in power prices and spark spreads We had expected to see these signs first in Q We maintain a bullish outlook on those companies that are not leveraged to power prices whether through strong risk management skills or through a lack of generation Our top two

Curr M E E TE Prev M E E POWER PRICES HAVE PEAKED WE ARE CROSSING THE MOUNTAINTOP AND NOW EXPECT A DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT June is the first month that we have seen negative yearonyear comparisons in the commodity drivers that underlie earnings Based on work in our last Power Curve report Power Curve we had not expected the commodity drivers of earnings to turn negative until Q Instead we see commodity comparisons turning negative in June and on a full quarterly basis Q June June Change Power Prices MWh Spark Spread MWh In our view the most important measure for earnings particularly for Power Producers is the Spark Spread which shows the gross margin potential for power generation in the spot market Hedging trading and the sale of other services such as capacity availability and spinning reserves offsets the impact of a decline in this number Most companies with generating capacity are at least hedged for hedged for and hedged for NEGATIVE QUARTERLY COMMODITY DRIVERS BEGINNING Q TWO QUARTERS AHEAD OF EARLIER EXPECTATIONS Forward power and gas markets suggest that Q will be the first full quarter of negative commodity comparisons Earlier in PC we had expected this would not occur until Q What has surprised us is the swiftness and breadth of the decline in the power pricing environment Unlike Q which had two good months April and May to buoy earnings forward markets suggest yearyear declines in power prices and the spark spread for all of Q and continuing into Q June is an important swing month in what is normally a relatively volatile earnings quarter So far because of lower realized prices and a declining power price outlook a number of companies have either pre announced or guided to reduced earnings expectations including PPL PNW PNM NRG KSE and CEG Quarterly Comparisons Power Prices and Spark Spreads DOWNGRADING STOCKS DECLINING POWER PRICES ARE NOT GOOD FOR EARNINGS In a declining power pricing environment investors should take a more cautious stance on companies who are long the commodity ie companies who because of their business model are making a long bet on commodity prices Within this constraint we look for signs that mitigate this exposure Furthermore we are positive on the longrun case for aggressive companies who are building newer more efficient power plants and replacing the aging plant that has built up under years of regulation As longrun bets companies such as Calpine CPN downgraded to H from H offer an excellent play on deregulation although we temper our outlook due to declining power prices Certain other Power Producers are better positioned than others and when we add the valuation component to this discussion the stock prices of many Producers peaked in late Aprilearly May we think a number still offer attractive value However our broad thrust is to recommend companies who are not long power or have small exposure whether because of strong trading and risk management skills or a lack of generating capacity In Power Curve when we first wrote about the declining price curve we suggested a more cautious stance towards Power Producers versus Energy Merchants We stand by that advice We are downgrading the rating on only Merchant vs Producers and Integrated Utilities who are exposed to power prices In terms of estimates only Merchants are being reduced while we are reducing Power Producers and Integrated Utilities Our top growthoriented picks for investors who want to avoid the impact of declining power prices are Energy Merchants ENE DYN and ILA For dividend or totalreturn investors we recommend Integrated Utilities EXC ETR and AEP MACRO VIEW WHY ARE POWER PRICES DECLINING Figure The Forward Power Curve MWh US F F F MWh The forward curve for power shows a rapid decline from peak levels achieved in and E Rapid growth in construction of new generating capacity is the primary cause of the decline in forward price expectations with the slowing economy an additional factor in the nearterm See Figure Additionally we cite two reasons why plant builds tend to overshoot either on the upside or the downside changes in the demand for power These are because electricity is capital intensive and a commodity each of which creates cycles of over and underdevelopment Incremental Capacity Exceeds Incremental Demand The cause of the current decline in prices is the rapid addition of new generating capacity in all regions of the country Additions to capacity are exceeding increases in demand for power by a wide margin in most regions This has caused the supply and demand balance to shift from a shortage to a growing surplus Additional factors have hastened the decline in prices A slowing economy has reduced demand as has the absence of last years hotterthannormal weather So far this summer weather has been approximately normal Capacity additions exceeded incremental demand in We think was the first year when incremental capacity exceeded incremental demand We still have an underlying power shortage which has lasted well into However the market is adding capacity in a manner which should relentlessly lessen its severity and even potentially create overcapacity within the next several years In megawatts MW of capacity was added up from in and less than MW during most of the s We expect approximately MW of capacity will be added in and a similar number in Since this amount exceeds the amount required to meet growth in demand we project a rising reserve margin The reserve margin is the best fundamental indicator of the balance between supply and demand with a high reserve margin indicating overcapacity falling power prices and a low reserve margin indicating undercapacity rising power prices We tentatively project a bottoming of the electricity commodity price cycle in if enough developers scale back their plans to build new plants Figure US Capacity Additions and Reserve Margin P E E E MW Additions Reserve Margin TWO REASONS FOR BOOM AND BUST CYCLES IN POWER Electricity is a cyclical commodity industry We have reached the peak of the firstever cycle in the history of the industry We put first in quotes because we think the cycles were always there except they were hidden by regulation With deregulation of the wholesale power market in marketclearing prices reveal the balance between supply and demand From until mid we were climbing the mountaintop of the electricity cycle Now we are on the downside Electricity production is capitalintensive We think the cycles will last a number of years years in the current cycle we put the first year as when enough liquidity existed in the newly deregulated market we see the bottom as driven by the capitalintensive nature of the industry Power plants take a long time to build Planning decisions must be made between and years in advance of the actual day when power will be produced This is a much slower process than the market and pricing expectations at the time of planning will have no doubt changed by the time plants are upandrunning We think it is difficult for individual company executives to fully anticipate the development plans of their competitors and in the quest for market share the tendency is to build in a manner which is often too aggressive when viewed on an industrywide basis years later GUIDE TO INVESTORS INDUSTRYLEVEL TRACK THE SPARK SPREAD A primary metric for investors to track is the spark spread The spark spread measures the difference between power prices revenues and natural gas prices cost This is the critical metric for tracking earnings power of generating companies The gross margin of Power Producers in the spot market will be determined by the spark spread and when these companies hedge they will have to hedge using the forward spark spread available at that time Thus a declining spark spread affects the earnings power of all companies even those who are well hedged Only if they could hedge would their earnings be unaffected by declining prices No company we are aware of has been able to hedge of their output The forward spark spread actually suggests a worse commodity price environment in the period than existed in prior to the runup in prices in Figure The Forward Spark Spread US F F F MWh GUIDE TO INVESTORS COMPANYLEVEL STOCKS THAT CAN WEATHER THE STORM The following factors will help companies weather the storm from most to least importance Trading and risk management skills A strong trading desk acts as the eyes and ears to the market often providing advance warning of changes in the commodity price outlook Companies with generating plant portfolios can use a strong trading desk to lock in power and gas prices earlier than their competitors The pure play Energy Merchants derive the bulk of their profits from trading and risk management activities own little if any generating capacity and are characterized by a commodity priceneutral earnings model All of our Energy Merchants have trading and risk management skills that help their overall activity Our top pick and a pure play Energy Merchant is Enron ENEH We do not see their earnings being affected by a declining price environment Other companies with strong tradingrisk management operations include Dynegy DYNH and Aquila ILAH Duke Energy DUKH and Mirant MIRH also have strong operations In terms of vulnerability to power prices we think ENE and ILA have the strongest positions owing to the lack or nearlack of generating capacity owned Contractinghedging activity The more aggressive a companys moves were to lock in power prices earlier this year the better positioned they are Nevertheless the unhedged portion of capacity can have a significant affect on earnings particularly in the longrun We note that Calpine CPNH which we have downgraded to H from H has aggressively stepped up its hedging activity in recent weeks signing a MW deal with Shell a MW deal with Reliant Resources RRINR This activity appears to coincide with the rapid declines in the forward curve we have seen over the past two months Offsetting short positions This is a characteristic typical of electric utilities who in many cases offset their long positions in generation with the short obligation to sell power to their customers Utilities that are well positioned in this regard include EXC and AEP Utilities that are most vulnerable are those who have aggressively developed generating capacity in an effort to capture some of the earnings and growth visibility of the pure play Power Producers These include AYE CEG and PPL We are particularly concerned about companies that have invested in peaking capacity or separately relatively inefficient plants that require a lot of capital dollars to upgrade These plants are often the marginal unit providing earnings in tight pricing environments but having significantly less value as prices decline Backlog of plant development We also think that companies with significant plant development backlogs can muscle their way through a weakened commodity price environment In particular we note CPN whose plants in operation grow as follows Figure Calpine Earnings Metrics E CAGR YE MW in operation of portfolio hedged EPS They have hedged aggressively their output from their plants so even though future plants have lower margins overall EPS growth can still be impressive Nevertheless we have also lowered our EPS estimates for CPN reflecting the impact of lower spark spreads on the unhedged portion of output Our revised Outperform rating for CPN reflects the likely strong visibility of EPS growth over the period SUMMARY OF RATINGSESTIMATESPRICE TARGET CHANGES REVISED VALUATION TABLE RISKS TO OUR MORE CAUTIOUS STANCE We see four principal risks to our more cautious stance Some horses are already out of the barn Power Producers and selected Energy Merchants those with exposure to power prices are down since peaking on May Some of the risk of declining forward power prices is now reflected in the stocks However we do not think all of the horses are out of the barn and advise cautiously shutting the barn door on selected stocks at this time The next leg that could drive stocks downward is declining EPS estimates We think this is likely particularly for and if power prices continue their decline We think when this happens stocks are likely to go down further Hotter Weather So far in weather across the country has been near normal vs hotterthannormal weather last year The yearonyear moderation has affected the forward curve Should August become hotter relative to last year the forward curve could temporarily strengthen boosting power price and earnings expectations nearterm Ultimately we think the principal cause of the decline in power prices is the dramatic build in power plants Even if the curve temporarily strengthens due to weather we still expect it will be downward sloping for the next several years A Rebound in the Economy A weak economy has certainly affected power demand which in turn has affected the forward curve When the economy eventually rebounds which some are predicting by Q or early the forward curve should strengthen We will watch for these signs and adjust our outlook accordingly Cancellations of plant development plans This factor is a wildcard for the group in our opinion We expect to see a number of weaker developers begin to cancel plant development plans So far sources such as turbine manufacturer GE has not given any indication turbine orders are being canceled Ifwhen they occur the cancellation of development plans will have two effects First it will confirm the increasingly difficult industry environment and would likely be perceived as negative Then following the cancellation of enough development plans it will sow the seeds for the recovery of power prices in the future This is why we think power prices will bottom in The mechanism for rebuilding the forward curve will in part be driven by cancellation of plant development plans and the restoration of a tighter supplydemand balance SUMMARY BECOMING MORE CAUTIOUS ON GROUP We are lowering ratings price targets andor estimates on companies with exposure to the declining trend in power prices We advise investors to be more cautious on the group However we continue to advise a shift toward Energy Merchants who have little or no commodity price exposure and away from Power Producers who are long power as well as those Integrated Utilities who are long power Additionally we see several factors that also merit a cautious outlook apart from the declining trend in power prices and its adverse effect on earnings Utilities as a defensive play may become less valuable if the broad market begins to recover andor tech stocks begin to outperform Growth Energy stocks have benefited from strong earnings visibility at a time when many other SP sectors have rolled over The resumption of earnings growth in any of these other sectors could draw growth capital away from our Growth Energy names particularly if their earnings is now under challenge QUARTERLY ESTIMATES PER SHARE DATA Current Year Next Year Next

mailtoIMCEANOTESLorenzoPascualCaneiroCLorenzoEPascualECaneiromorganstanleyEcomE NRONcom Sent Wednesday July PM To Subject EPRM course Dear Prof Kaminski first of all let me introduce myself My name is Lorenzo Pascual and a collegue of mine and I attended the Energy Power Risk Management course that took place in London some weeks ago About my CV I have finished a Ph D in Mathematics Statistics and Econometrics at University Carlos III in Madrid Spain as well as a master degree in Mathematical Finance both of them two months ago In particular in my dissertation I have developed new statistical techniques using bootstrap methods for forecasting returns and volatilities in the GARCH and Stochastic Volatility family of models I have already one published article at the International Journal of Forecasting and I have three more papers under revision in other international journals Of course if you are interested in this kind of research I can send to you a copy of the working papers Since then I work for Endesa Trading spanish electricity company based in Madrid However at this moment I am based here in London for two years working in a joint venture with Morgan Stanley During the course I had the pleasure to talk with you and you gave me the opportunity of asking you some of the questions and doubts I have about energy derivatives We did not have enough time to discuss anything deeply so you asked me to send all the questions by email If you are in London it would be for me a pleasure to meet you here for lunch some day and then we could talk much better about everything If you can not it will be ok to use the email I hope you can find some time to help me with this Of course I thank you very much in advance for your help because I understand you are very busy The main questions I need to be solved are the following This first question is very important because I want to know how to use Monte Carlo methods for pricing all kind of options on the forward price when no analytical formula is available To understand the procedure I have compared the analytical formula with the monte carlo results For example when the price follows the geometric brownian motion I have programed the analytical expression for a call on the forward price see attached file in matlab pricegbmm which corresponds with formula in the book together with the monte carlo method proposed in your book with Clewlow and Strickland chapter see attached file pricegbmMCm In this case I achieve the same results However if I try to do the same exercise when the underlying follows the simplest mean reversion process formula I obtain very different results using formula in the book I think there is a printing mistake on it and the Monte Carlo techniques I do not really understand what might be happening You suggested me to send to you the matlab files to check them more carefully The names are pricemrm and pricemrMCm for the analytical and monte carlo respectively Could it be possible to have some of the data sets you use in the book to check if I achieve the same estimated parameters with my programs estimacionmbgm and estimacionmrm Once you have estimated the unknown parameters from the data set in particular the speed of meanreversion and if you want to use the option formula under meanreversion which is the value for this parameter to introduce in the formula the annualized one or not In case I have to use the annualized value into the pricing formula I have a very important question which is driving my crazy In the particular case of electricity price series the estimated annualized speed of mean reversion I obtain are really very high and very far from zero In this case if you compare the pricing values obtained using the usual black formula and the one obtained under meanreversion we achieve very different values Is that correct Did you have similar results to mine when working with electricity series I computed these two values under the same volatility Going back to the previous point why do we have to use the spot price volatility and not the forward volatility in the pricing formula I do not understand why since the underlying in this case is the forward price If I compute the speed of meanreversion for the same data set working with hourly data and with daily data constructed as the sample mean of the hourly observations I obtain very different values for this parameter for the annualized value Is that normal Can be the different volatility values in these two series the reason of that Should not be both numbers very similar the annualized ones of course If the estimated numbers we obtain for the speed of meanreversion have to be different depending on the time between observations has it sense the following question if the underlying of my product is a monthly forward price should I compute the speed of meanreversion I mean the annualized value with monthly spot prices In such a case I expect to obtain a value closer to zero than in the other cases with hourly and daily data and then I will obtain a pricing value not as different to that obtained with the usual Black formula Finally can you give me references papers working papers about who to value swing options Thank you very much in advance You can not imagine how much I appreciate your answers Looking forward to hearing from you Best regards

as provided for Int arbitration INTERNATIONAL lenders of Enrons Dabhol Power Company including the US gov ernments Overseas Private Investment have said they extended loans worth about million to the project only because the PPA provided for settlem ent of disputes by neutral international arbitration Had the PPA not prov ided for settlement of disputes before arbitration panel in a neutral forum we would not have disbursed loans worth about USD million DPCs foreign lenders have submitted in an application seeking intervention in th e energy majors petition to be heard by the Supreme Court next week The PPA constitutes the projects backbone as DPCs entire revenues were to be received from Maharashtra State Electricity Board and were the basis for o ur decision to extend the said loans to the billion project The FIIs s ay that MSEB knew that the cost of developing and building the project woul d be obtained in substantial part from loans provided to DPC on a nonre course basis by them and other lenders MSEB had expressly confirmed agr eed and acknowledged that monies due to DPC from itself would be paid direc tly to an account escrow in this case created for our benefit and securit y they said Emphasising for international arbitration in dispute resolut ion between DPC and MSEB the FIIs submitted before the Supreme Court that the arbitration provision to be held in London a neutral international loc ation under the UNCITRAL rules was critical factor in their decision to f und the project PTI THE ASIAN AGE Monday July DPC lenders offered loan on neutral basis

and other lenders PTI BUSINESS STANDARD Monday July Centre to keep off Dabhol spat The Centre is unlikely to intervene directly in the Dabhol problem despite Enrons willingness to sell its interest in the mw project to the gove rnment Power ministry sources said the government has made its intentions very clear on this issue on several occasions that any direct intervention by the Centre was highly unlikely as it would face severe opposition from o ther states There is absolutely no change in that stance at present sai d an official The Centre was inclined to play the role of facilitator only in arriving at a solution to the problem and the central governments rep resentative in the renegotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra gover nment had already been asked to expedite the proceedings he said Enron in a statement on Saturday said that as the largest shareholder in Dabhol Pow er Company DPC the company believed that selling its interest either to the central government or to the projects lenders was the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute between DPC and the Maharashtra State Elect ricity Board MSEB It stressed that any sale would need to be on terms pr oviding a complete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures The company pointed out that the Dabhol issue was clearly having an adverse eff ect on the confidence of potential foreign investors to India Pursuing a buyout option could help resolve the dispute in a timely manner protecting Indias investment climate and interests of DPCs stakeholders said the s tatement The company said that while DPC remained open to discussing other viable solutions it had serious concerns about getting embroiled in a ser ies of renegotiations It pointed out that no realistic proposal was offer ed to the company as yet and no progress had been made in securing creditw orthy buyers that can purchase power at a price that was reasonable for new generation plants The statement said that until the issue was resolved DP C intended to continue pursuing all other remedies under the PPA such as i nternational arbitration to resolve the issue in a way that protected the rights of DPC sponsors lenders fuel suppliers and LNG ship owners Pressure tactic says lenders Lenders to DPC are unmoved by the companys demand that they take over the project and dubbed it as a pressure tactic The company had said in a press release on Saturday that the best solution would be for the Union governme nt or the lenders to take over the project We need to run our banks and i nstitutions and not a power project said one senior banker involved in th e project The lenders however accept the fact there is a sense of urgency and the government must get into the act faster At the London meeting last week DPC showed its willingness to run Phase II of the project on naphtha but MSEB is not willing to give its nod to commissioning of the Phase II THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Monday July MSEB FIs plan roping in Centre for picking Enron equity in DPC Sanjay Jo g Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB and Indian financial institution s IFIs are planning to make a last ditch effort to rope in the BJPled go vernment at the Centre for picking up the Enron equity in the Dabhol projec t through its undertaking as their funds amounting to over Rs crore i n addition to a guarantee of Rs crore to offshore lenders are involve d in the projectThe MSEB has contributed nearly Rs crore to pick up per cent equity in the Dabhol phaseI and the IFIs have collectively lent Rs crore for both the phases plus a guarantee of Rs crore to of fshore lenders MSEB and IFIs sources told The Financial Express that the E nron chairman Kenneth Lays statement on Enrons desire to pull out of Dabh ol project has not come as a rude shock but as an expected one However t hese sources said that if Enron wants to be out of mw Dabhol project their exist should take place after tough negotiations with an active in volvement of the Union government They have projected various scenarios including the Enron General Electric and Bechtel collectively agreeing to recover about to per cent of th e total equity of million in the Dabhol project from the Industrial De velopment Bank of India which is a rupee lender consortium leader The MSE B and IFIs are aware that the Enron and other equity holders will insist on the full capital recovery and that they will be quite keen on purchase of their equity with interest at par by the new buyer However MSEB and IFIs sources are of the view that due to their hard barga ining in the presence of the Centre the Enron and other stakeholders may a rrive at certain compromise so that they can recover a substantial amount b locked in the project Secondly in view of cut in the equity the loan amo unting to over billion could be restructured at the lower interest of per cent and that the moratorium period should be increased Thirdly th e Centre will lend a financial support to its undertaking to pick up majori ty equity and take over the Dabhol project they feel According to MSEB an d IFIs in another scenario the staterun Gas Authority of India Ltd Gail and Indian Oil Corporation IOC should be asked to take over the liquifi ed natural gas LNG project in a serious bid to cut the tariff The per un it tariff which has been average at Rs may come down to Rs to R s per unit The Dabhol Power Company is believed to have spent nearly Rs crore on the LNG project Moreover the MSEB which is at present doubtful over the fate of its equit y of Rs crore may pick up per cent equity and appeal to the Mumbai based utilities Tata Power and BSES for taking up the balance equity in the Dabhol project The MSEB and IFIs are keen that the impending issue be res olved amicably especially to avoid the legal battle in India and arbitrati on in London A section of MSEB is confident that the power purchase agreem ent PPA on the issue of misdeclaration and default on the availability of power by DPC can be proved null and void and there will be no need for the payment of any compensation to DPC This will enable the take over of Dabh ol project by an Indian entity quite possible Lay seems using pressure tac tics Mr Lays statement on Enron pull out is being seen in the political ci rcle as a pressure tactic especially when the Supreme Court is hearing the DPCs petition on August THE TIMES OF INDIA Saturday July Four states not to buy power at current rates Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Saturday that tho ugh four states have expressed their willingness to purchase power from the Enronpromoted Dhabol power project they are not in a financial position t o buy them at the prevailing tariff All wish to purchase power but not at the current rate Bhujbal said after a function organised by exserviceme n Four states Madhya Pradesh Delhi Karnataka and Punjab had agreed to b uy power from Enrons troubled Dabhol Power Project at a tariff as low as R s to Rs per unit during a meeting Godbole Renegotiations Committe e had with prospective buyer states on July here Replying to a query re garding the US giants desire to pull out of the power project in India he quipped jinko jaana hai wo jayenge unko koi rok nahi sakta those who wish to leave will leave no one can stop them He however expressed hop e that the current Enron imbroglio would be settled after the Supreme Court delivers its verdict The state government would deal with the issue depen ding on the verdict of the Supreme Court Bhujbal added PTI THE TIMES OF INDIAMonday July Maharashtras offer unrealistic DPC US energy major Enrons Dabhol Power Company DPC on Friday said that pric e proposals made by four states to draw power from the Dabhol project were totally unrealistic even as Godbole renegotiations committee reported a stalemate in the talks with DPC Referring to the offer of Karnataka Delhi Madhya Pradesh and Punjab to buy power at a tariff as low as Rs and Rs DPC said unfortunately these are totally unrealistic proposals unattainable by new generation liquid plants including those set up by the public sector On the other hand after meeting DPC officials on Friday m orning Madhav Godbole told reporters that currently talks with DPC had rea ched a stalemate with interested states quoting lower prices than the US en ergy majors expectation After discussions with four states and receiving communications from Haryana and Rajasthan he said that all these were read y to draw DPCs mw phaseII power at an average rate of Rs to Rs per unit An overall demand for DPC power is at around mw to mw but not all of these is a base load one Moreover it is for more than half a year mainly nonmonsoon months of November to May Godbole said H e added that the states had informed the commission that each of them had a regulatory framework in the form of an electricity regulatory authority in place and was bound by a merit dispatch order which did not allow them to buy costly power like DPCs so long as cheaper tariff was available in t heir own state PTI THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE Saturday July Demand for DPC power only at particular price THE Godbole panel today conveyed the powerofftake proposals of six States to Dabhol Power Company DPC officials The company was told that there wa s combined demand for MW power at not more than Rs per unit One thing is abundantly clear There is demand for DPC power at a parti cular price If the price increases the demand may not be large Dr Godbol e told reporters We have told Enron that the need for to MW DP C power is not at baseload nor is it an allyearround demand The States will require this power only between the months of April to November and th e demand will fall during the rainy season he said Karnataka Punjab Delhi and Madhya Pradesh made representations to the pan el yesterday Rajasthan and Haryana have presented written proposals asking for and MW each While Madhya Pradesh has asked for power at Rs per unit other States have said they will not pay more than Rs to Rs per unit According to Dr Godbole the company officials will tak e up the matter with lenders and collaborators before the next meeting wh ich is expected to be held in August Meanwhile according to DPC the powe r purchase proposals presented by various States are totally unrealistic and unattainable by new generation liquid fuel plants including even those in the public sector such as NTPCs Kayamkulam Dr Godbole had suggested that DPC power at competitive rates could replace captive power in a nu mber of States He said though DPC had earlier agreed to reduce tariffs by paise this would no longer be easy as the project has seen cost escalat ion after stoppage of phase II work Our dialogue with Enron is bogged d own by two issues the plant load factor at which the unit is run and the price of power Dr Godbole said He said there was a need to take a se rious look at whether demand projections in the country are realistic THE ECONOMIC TIMES Monday July Maharashtra to pay Rs cr penalty to MSEB Girish Kuber MAHARASHTRA has decided to pay Rs crore to the ailing Maharashtra State Electricity Board to compensate it for the damage it has caused the power utility through tariff concessions to various sectors Padmasinh Patil the states energy minister had wanted to give tariff concessions to farmers which was objected to by MSEB Even the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission asked the states energy department to restrain its generosity The MERC had asked the government not to offer concessions at the cost of its SEB and directed it to make a budgetary provision if it wanted to go ah ead with its plan Accordingly Mr Patil announced last year that the state government will compensate the board The MERC had set a deadline of Octob er for sanctioning the compensation The supplementary demand presente d to the state assembly makes this provision It has been decided to give subsidy to MSEB to compensate the loss arising from supplying electricity a t concessional rate to agricultural and powerloom consumers with effect fro m May said the demand by the states finance ministry Currently concessions of per cent and per cent in the electricity bills is given to powerloom and agricultural consumers The total expendit ure involved in the proposal is estimated to be around Rs crore The is sue of offering concessions to powerloom and agriculture consumers has been hanging fire for the last couple of years The board last year had raised the tariff for agriculture and powerloom consumers which was opposed by the state government for obvious reasons The government announced a rollback of the tariff hike only to be prevented by the MERC from doing so The MSE B will now be charging Rs per one horse power pump bringing down the r ate from Rs and Rs per loom down from the earlier rate of Rs The government has also decided to waive per cent of the Rs crore unpaid dues from powerlooms Delayed payment charges for the defaulters has also been waived and they have been granted three instalments for clearing old dues According to MSEBs own admission more than lakh of the tot al lakh consumers are being supplied subsidised power

The tropical wave in the Caribbean near Hispaniola does not look as organized as it did yesterday This will result in a delay of naming it a storm with the distinct possibility it never develops Most

Range StDP Cou nt Day Discussion All of the models point to a ve ry warm period for the day outlook and likely beyond The early stag es of my predicted warmer than normal August appear to be setting up as pla nned What seems to be in disagreement is where the hottest air sets up It has been the Plains primarily this summer The most recent runs of the Eur opean and Navy models suggest that the hottest air especially relative to n ormal shifts to the Lakes and NE as a monster of a ridge forms in the area The Canadian and MRF models look more like a flat broad ridge East of the Rockies which keeps the heat core West of the Mississippi If any of these verify close to reality most all of the Eastern of the country will be above normal anyway but I like the large ridge idea the European seems o verdone The pattern continues to be favorable for t ropical activity but something out in the tropics has to get cranked up first The last couple of years most tropical activity has been recurved NE away from the US du e to a trough in the Atlantic It currently is no where to be found but at the moment neither is the tropical activity Day Sunday August Syncrasys Choice Delta Temp

expected for mo st areas through the end of the week and beyond Tropical wave in the Carib bean has become more organized over the past hours The ridge in the Plains and building East looks quite strong to me In an ordinary August this should have more triple digit heat than we are seeing The humidity an d associated heat indices are more than making up for this Consistent rain from earlier in the summer seem to be still having an impact on temperatur es The only shower activity of note this morning is in the Upper Midwest w ith a weak cold front pressing down from Canada This will reach the NE by the weekend but cooling will be less dramatic than recent episodes There will be some subtle sh ifts with the Plains ridge but not a huge effect o n sensible weather A weak monsoonal flow continues in the West especially the SW We also have a trough supplying cool air for the NW This trough s hould weaken considerably late in the period with signs the Plains ridge ex pands into the West As for the tropics I still see a potential for Bar ry to form late this week in the Southern Gulf The wave from this in the Caribbean looks healthier today Rains from this will spread into the South ern half of Florida today The hurricane models have been run on this syste m and one of the intensity indicators predict a minimal hurriczane by Frida y I caution that to be way overblown

another major trough and subsequent cooldown for the Great Lakes and North east There is no other model support for this at this time and it is my op inion that those forecasts will bust in a big way Now having said that t here is some support for the ridge to shift West temporarily into the Rocki es That often results in a trough in the NE which is climatologically favo red I just think the magnitude of the MRF is way overdone I am maintainin g earlier forecasts of largely above normal temperatures East of the Rockie s until further evidence indicates otherwise At the same time the West

William Wise will testify for a sec ond time Monday in FERCs investigation into alleged manipulation of Califo rnias energy market The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly award ed Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate El Paso Merchant Ener gy Before the start of testimony the FERC ALJ said that an April mem orandum sent between Wise and another official relates the minute details of everything that is happening in the company showing that Mr Wise was w ell aware of everything That seems to run contrary to Wises testimony at the previous May hearing where testified he did not micromanage the affai rs of El Pasos subsidiaries The California PUC testified that El Paso awa rded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season sayin g it biased the open season in favor of the total package bid If a singl e bid for all of the capacity exceeded million then individual bids could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to E l Paso Therefore even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonab ly high rates their success was totally dependent upon the other partial p ackage bids by other shippers A total of shippers submitted partial bid s and none of them were awarded any capacity the PUC said But El Paso di sputed those claims saying that it made the minimum economic criteria befo re the open season thus giving no one an advantage YOU DESIGNED IT WE BUILT IT ZaiNet GasMaster II Todays most comprehensive gas trading scheduling and accounting system CAMINUS Your Competitive Edge in Energy Call us at or visit us at the

understand about valuation Also do you think it is an advantage that you are doing business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage Im thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies and financial institutions Let me know if you think you could get support for this at Enron By the way I still need a name and address to send my check back I think Shirley can take care of it Thanks regards Sheridan Sheridan I am aware of the duplicate check problem and I owe you phone call about this I am still trying to mobilize internal support for the valuation study we discussed at San Antonio Mark Ruane whom you met moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study Internal Enron perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big financial institutions or lack of it especially in the energy area regarding valuation of investment projects Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values It will help if I get the agenda of the conference soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him Vince Original Message From

to mention it to Shirley before I left I just got back last Friday Shirley left me a phone message to mail the check back to her If you can email Shirleys last name and mailing address to me Ill send her the check Also if you are interested in having me do some work on the valuation issues we discussed at the Texas Finance Festival please let me know One more thing The university that Im affliliated with in Hong Kong HKUST just hired a new president Paul Chu who is from Houston and has some sort of relationship with Ken Lay The Dean at the HKUST business school mentioned that Paul Chu was meeting with Ken Lay this summer and would discuss possible avenues of collaboration If you can think of anything that you would be interested in let me know and I can discuss it with the Dean I

Find Output Targets Elusive Big oil companies are failing to meet production growth targets because they are using up mature fields faster than they can find and develop big enough new ones to replace them according to analysts ExxonMobil Shell and Chevron have all missed output targets despite the incentive of two years of high oil prices ExxonMobil planned a annual growth target last year but its output for the second quarter of was flat versus a year ago Shell reported that its nd quarter production increased by only well short of the target Depletion from existing oil fields runs at an average rate of about per year and that has to be replaced by an equivalent amount of new production just to keep output steady From t o the six biggest publicly traded companies largely failed to replace th e oil and natural gas they produced with new reserves after stripping out th e effect of acquisitions and revisions according to Andersen management consulting BP posted one of the best performances replacing of its natural gas production and of its oil Shell replaced only of its natural gas and of its oil according to Andersen BP has set the most ambitious production growth target

and were shocked by the minus Bcf storage number reported for the East They coul d not entirely dismiss it however They noted that in the last years all the new plants that have been built are natural gas only facilities Last week could have been a good indication of what that could mean to the marke t The AGA says they checked and rechecked when they came up with the unbe lievable number The AGAs numbers have always lined up with the more exten sive EIA reports It is possible that a number of factors came together all at once with the impact of Barry on production and an higher generation l oads because of Eastern heat wave However the curve in the cash market ha s been going down That may mean that if there is a market opportunity to m ove volumes from storage to a consumer right now that could be done assum ing or weeks later it could be replaced at the same price or maybe even less Also there is speculation that the pipelines were repacking their lines with volumes out of

the single largest component in the travel mix In recognition of this fact a number of significant discounts have been negotiated with all of the major carriers There are two separa te channels available to employees to access the Enronnegotiated fares T he first is Travel Agency in the Park TAP or the GSSapproved preferre d travel agency for your location and the second is the new Enronmanaged online travel booking service ClickTrip located at ncomenron Over the coming weeks GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri p as the primary method of booking domestic US

the Enronnegotiated fares Second industry data shows that employees will generally make the most costeffective trave l decision when presented with the relevant facts Conservatively speaking we

Germany Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph ysical supply contract with an industrial customer The customer based in Stendal Germany operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta king gas from Enron for a contract of MW of interruptible oneyear base load In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co mpleted a gas supply transaction the first inside Germany by a nonincumbe nt player with EnBW at Steinitz to overcome capacity constraints expected in Q this year Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany Enron had to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German y in order to close the gas supply deal Although we are happy that we ha ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac tual obligations it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net work operators while this was a transaction only within Germany the neg otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France commented Carsten H aack who closed this deal together with HelgeJuergen Beil Ulrich Finke a nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team Another important el ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran sportation contract for VNG Germanys largest German import company after Ruhrgas This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals especially in East Germany said Haack But more importantly this deal will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo mers it can deliver on its promises and of equal importance that network operators had better take our transportation requests seriously he added

Vidyadhar Date THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Tuesday August Enron impact takes its toll FI lenders scrips plunge on bourses Sharad Mi stry Laxmikant Khanvilkar THREE major financial institutions ICICI IDBI and IFCI are witnessing an increased selling wave on the bourses over the past few trading sessions thanks to their collective exposure in the controversial Enronpromoted billion Dabhol Power Company DPC The total exposure in DPC of these FI s and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank including foreign currency guarantees works out to over Rs crore Little wonde r therefore that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sh eets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these FIs The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding While the stock pr ice of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs and Rs respective ly that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs levels Early this mo nth IDBI was quoted at Rs IFCI at Rs and ICICI at Rs IC ICI however had touched Rs on August a new low from previous levels This clearly indicates that plagued by the rising share of nonperformin g loans NPLs to total assets of all the three FIs the share prices of th ese FIs have came under severe pressure Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead especially because o f the tightening of the nonperforming assets guidelines by the Reserve Ban k of India RBI Moreover the kind of trading activity witnessed at these counters is alarming While the volume of share trade is substantial ther e is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks Quite clearly these are no good indicators at least for the time being However these compan ies disbursalapprovals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms i e per cent of total disbursal approvals For example ICICIs gross NPL as of March stands at a whopping Rs crore Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs crore and Rs crore respectively Its exposure in the power se ctor which stood at Rs crore or per cent of the total exposure of Rs crore has been on the decline Last year they stood at per cent of Rs crore On the other hand IDBIs stock price is on the s lide since the beginning of this month It is currently quoting at Rs T he counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the ra nge of plus The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below par for quite sometime now Further the scrip has been losing steam since August when it was quoting at Rs Currently it is quoting below Rs THE ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday August FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake Samik Dasgupta Soma Baner jee THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enrons equity in the Dabhol power proje ct has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with pote ntial buyers FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing a roadmap for Enrons exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete the Dabhol project Although about per cent of the project is complete the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of co ntracts and possibilities of the cost escalating With Enron having already announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources the new inves tor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the projects co mpletion Speaking to ET finance secretary Ajit Kumar said FIs have been told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buye r can offer for the Dabhol project Since it is totally buyer driven FIs w ill have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the potential buyers Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers f or that too Tata Power Hindujas and some other leading industrial house s are interested in buying out Enron FIs are going to talk individually to all the interested companies and the equity will be sold to the highest b idder Kumar said According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angle s are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invokin g legal provisions The aim is to work out an out ofcourt settlement to the issue Valuation is not an issue as the project has a year life cycl e an official said FI sources claimed that their role is that of a faci litator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common poin tFIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get a cover for the second phase of the project As of now the first phase of the project has been given the counterguarantee while the promoters are p ushing for a similar cover to ensure payments THE ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday August Dabhol dispute unfortunate Govt THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enronpromoted Dabh ol Power Project as an unfortunate experience in foreign investment in th e countrys infrastructure sector Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial i

favour thereby pro ving its fair and independent nature he added Speaking after launching th e Confederation of Indian Industries International the international arm o f the chamber he said Indian industry has had enough protection and should not ask for more Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping ne w markets abroad our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its po tential Abdullah saidIndian missions abroad have to realise that their role is changing he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integr al to foreign policy and a key determinant of a countrys political and str ategic influence He said the ministry of external affairs had also started working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide nec essary support to the countrys business chambers and industry to position itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS Tuesday August Omar terms Dabhol unfortunate experience THE Centre has called the Enronpromoted Dabhol power project controversy a s an unfortunate experience Enron is a very unfortunate episode in our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial infras tructure sector and I wish it had never happened minister of state for ex ternal affairs Omar Abdullah said here on Monday Nevertheless the country s judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enrons favour thereby proving its fair and independent nature he said while launching Confede ration of Indian Industrys CII international arm CII International CI II Stating that there is no alternative to globalisation Mr Abdullah sa id Indian industry has had enough protection and should not ask for more Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping new markets abroad our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its potential he added The new outfit CIII created to facilitate the process of internationali sation of domestic companies will have a budget of Rs crore which is a lmost per cent of the Confederations total budget CII president Sanjiv Goenka said Institutionalisation of CIII is part of the value addition exercise of the Confederation to accelerate the process of globalisation he said adding t hat CII will leverage its partners in countries to the process CIII will be headed by Arun Bharat Ram Piyush Bahal has been appointed head of the CIII secretariat Speaking on the occasion Arun Bharat Ram said CII I will take proactive initiatives to enhance the countrys share in interna tional trade He said that CII already has a dedicated WTO cell to facilit ate the process of internationalisation of domestic companies Write to the Editor THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August Power Play Editorial With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue Enron chairman Kenneth La y understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threa tened India with sanctions In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee Mr Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such a ction and is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mec hanisms Fair enough But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making them out to be Consider the facts In the course of the controversial inte rview Mr Lay said that if Enron was squeezed to accept less than the co st incurred by it on building the power plant that would amount to exprop riation by the Indian government He added for good measure that US laws prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property of American companies Significantly an Enron team is slated to negotiate with Indian lenders this week One of the proposals doing the rounds is th at the financial institutions FIs buy out Enrons stake in Dabhol Power C ompany DPC and warehouse the shares till they can find another buyer T he FIs on their part have indicated their willingness to slash interest r ates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable But theyre n ot willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice So theyre expected to ask Enron to accept a discount of to per cent on its asking price T he bargaining is likely to be tough and savvy negotiators routinely try to psyche the opposition beforehand Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bus h administration In the light of all this is the timing of his remarks pu re coincidence Mr Lay of course has his own compulsions While the Dabhol imbroglio has undoubtedly hurt India Enrons armour is not without some chinks which In dian negotiators would do well to note The company faces accusations whic h it denies that it manipulated power prices in California Its share pric e has fallen more than per cent since the start of the year and chief e xecutive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly forcing Mr Lay to take over the CEOs job as well Unfortunately Indian negotiators are unl ikely to use what should be their trump card the Godbole Committees obser vation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of th e decisionmaking process Because doing so could embarrass too many promin ent people on both ends of the political spectrum Even so the Indian side should hang tough There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun off as a separate power centre Enron let out its harbour facilities to oth er LNG importers and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee lo ans These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in Hopefully the Dabh ol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians an d multinationals about the perils of nontransparent negotiated deals as opposed to a genuinely free market If it does and if India gets its act t ogether on power sector reforms we may yet see some light at the end of th e long long tunnel THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol Sanjay Dutta US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seekin g sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government over the billion Dabhol power project even as domestic financial inst itutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about m illion Rs crore for its completion In a letter to Prime Minister A tal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday a copy of which was available with The Tim es of India Enron CEO Kenneth said A recent story in the Financial Times which mischaracterised discussions with me appears to have caused signif icant unintended concern Counter to the impression given in the story I have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions Lay said in his letter that Enrons approach was to settle the issue amicab ly by selling its stake Furthermore I did not say that the Dabhol power plant had been expropriated Upon questioning from the publicator publishe r I did factually explained the several possible options available includ ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr otect its businesses However that is far from suggesting that we have dec ided to pursue these mechanisms Lay said Our preferred approach approac h continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to In dian governmental and financial institutions Lay said However Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding Without agreement on that we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement Lay also sent copies of th e letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabh u PTI ADDS The IDBIled FIs consortium may increase their exposure to en able the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Companys equit y at a per cent discount to its face value The FIs are exploring a poss ibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilit ies after months from PhaseII completion the report said If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs then IDBI s revised exposure would be at Rs crore from existing Rs crore ICICI Rs crore from Rs crore SBI Rs crore from Rs crore IFCI Rs crore from Rs crore and Canara Bank Rs crore f rom Rs crore Even in the best case the exposure requirements from do mestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms the report quote d FI sources as saying Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks like IDFC PFC PNB Union Bank Bank of India among others would be accru ed through syndication FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a backup for their exposure the report quoted the sources as saying Last we ek the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible b ailout package for Dabhol The proposals envisage concessions from stakehol ders around per cent concessional duty on the energy majors liquefi ed natural gas plant a mega power project status and offset of custom duti es on LNG supply THE TIMES OF INDIA Tuesday August Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush Vidyadhar Date Enron has denied that it had approached the US government in an effort to obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec t The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay The repor t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are US laws that could prevent the US g overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated properties of US companies An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush Meanwhile the legal tussle between energy activists the Maharashtra gover nment and Enron continues in India The state government is preparing a fre sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions CITU which is the lab our wing of the Communist Party of India Marxist and activist Abhay Meht a against the Dabhol project The affidavit will make a strong case against Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv SenaBJP dom inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve rsial multinational The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and more evidence emerging against the project The government will rely substa ntially on the MD Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities In the petition CITU and Abhay Mehta author of the book Power Play whic h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama have challenged the clea rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority They argue d that since the project had been renegotiated it required a fresh review by the CEA They described as false the claim of the previous government th at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff AntiEnron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen t setbacks received by the company Regarding the explosion in Enrons Tees ide plant in England which left three workers dead Mr Pradyumna Kaul ener gy activist said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for the Dabhol plantEnron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling the drastic fall in stocks and the explosion in the Teeside plant Mr Kenneth Lay the companys chairpers on is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the US explaining the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St reet While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India it is also re ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity being voiced in other parts of the world Antiprivatisation activists inva ded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last

University Department of Administrative Sciences Buyukdere Caddesi Ayasaga Maslak Istanbul TURKEY Phone Fax ABSTRACT In earlier work we showed we could not reject the hypothesis that returns to investments in Turkeys stock market were positive functions of risk generated by the World outside Turkey and by risks unique to Turkey We found statistical evidence of Turkeys internal risks producing substantial returns and changes in returns over time This article carries the analysis further by bringing our earlier results into a more concrete environment asking whether these risks can be profitably managed as a practical matter In particular we consider results of two strategies in trading crossmarket portfolios We examine a long position in the ISE Dollar Return Index offset by a short position in the SP Composite Total Returns Index In this analysis we verify profitability directly by computing actual profit produced by an implementable trading strategy We identify our two portfolio management strategies using ValueatRiskinspired measures of risk and return We also examine the importance of secondary issues in portfolio management such as identification of buy and sell signals and selection of a trading position We examine two issues determining the performance of a trading position in this crossmarket portfolio First are there predictable and substantial periods of time when it is good to be long Turkey and short the Rest of the World and the reverse Second how important is it to monitor the time path of the risks unique to Turkeys Financial Markets in comparing

Mailto Postal Erasmus University DR Rotterdam THE NETHERLANDS ABSTRACT Electricity prices are known to be very volatile and subject to frequent jumps due to system breakdown demand shocks and inelastic supply As many international electricity markets are in some state of deregulation more and more participants in these markets are exposed to these stylised facts Appropriate pricing portfolio and risk management models should incorporate these facts Authors have introduced stochastic jump processes to deal with the jumps but we argue and show that this specification might lead to problems with identifying the true meanreversion within the process Instead we propose using a regime jump model that disentangles meanreversion from jump behaviour This model resembles more closely

generates stock return predictability on both the time series and the cross section In our model investors income has two sources wages and dividends that grow stochastically over time As a consequence the fraction of total income produced by wages changes over time depending on economic conditions We show that as this fraction fluctuates the risk premium that investors require to hold stocks varies as well We test the main implications of the model and find substantial support for it A regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor income to consumption ratio produces statistically significant coefficients and adjusted R s that are larger than those generated when using the dividend price ratio Tests of the cross sectional implication find considerable improvements on the performance of both the conditional CAPM and CCAPM when compared to their unconditional counterparts JEL Classification G Earnings Quality and Stock Returns BY KONAN CHAN National Taiwan

flow are reliably negatively associated with future stock returns Earnings increases that are accompanied by high accruals suggesting lowquality earnings are associated with poor future returns We explore various hypotheses earnings manipulation extrapolative biases about future growth and underreaction to business conditions to explain accruals predictive power Distinctions between the hypotheses are based on evidence from operating performance the behavior of individual accrual items and discretionary versus nondiscretionary components of accruals JEL Classification G G M M

opinionproducing agents We find that career concerns can create an incentive for exaggeration or antiherding since highability agents will have opinions that are more different from the consensus on average and potential clients will learn more quickly about how different an agents opinions are from the consensus on average that about whether or not they are exaggerating The model predicts that agents should exaggerate more when they are underrated by their clients when the realizations of the variables they are forecasting are expected to be especially noisy and when they expect to make fewer future forecasts We find that these predictions are consistent with the empirical data on equity analysts earnings forecasts Keywords Herding Career Concerns Reputation Learning JEL

American Depositary Receipts ADRs These ADRs are issued by the same foreign firms against shares with different voting rights Though superior and inferior voting siblings begin their US trading experience at nearly equal values relative prices of Mexican and nonMexican sibling ADRs quickly move in opposite directions Superior voting ADRs command a median premium for nonMexican firms but a median discount for Mexican issuers The Mexican evidence represents an extreme exception to the inverse relation between the voting premium documented in other countries and the degree of legal protection enjoyed by outside shareholders This apparent anomaly cannot be explained by differences in cash flow rights total or systematic risk liquidity voting control of major blockholders or ownership restrictions Despite voting premiums and discounts neither sibling in most pairs appears to have been an attractive investment for US investors JEL Classification G G G Comparing the Quality

th Floor Broad Street Atlanta GA USA ABSTRACT We use data during to compare the quality of three quarterly earnings measures The Street a proforma operating income proxy obtained from firms earnings releases and two earnings measures obtained from Q and K reports EPS from operations and EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued operations Three techniques are used to assess quality predictive ability valuation relevance and information content Predictive ability is examined by determining which measure is the most accurate predictor of future quarterly earnings four quarters hence We assess valuation relevance by identifying which earnings measure has the most explanatory power and the highest earnings multiplier We determine information content by finding which measure has the most explanatory power and generates the highest earnings response coefficient Based on our three techniques to assess earnings quality we find that a timely proforma operating income measure released by managers The Street is of higher quality than either EPS from operations or EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued operations Regulators are concerned that users of financial statements are misled by proforma earnings releases and that they should rely instead on information in financial reports Our findings suggest that users of financial information can obtain higher quality earnings measures using proforma operating income numbers released by managers than they can by perusing less timely Q and K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission JEL Classification M G The Timing of Initial Public Offerings A Real Option Approach BY JASON DRAHO Yale University Document Available from the SSRN Electronic Paper Collection papertafabstractid Date December Contact JASON DRAHO Email Mailto Postal Yale University New Haven CT USA Phone ABSTRACT This paper analyzes the timing of IPOs by treating the goingpublic decision as a real option Investors value the private firm using publicly observed market prices of firms from the same industry With stochastically evolving market values firm insiders want to leave open the option of taking the firm public later after a positive price shock Going public exercises this option which must be viewed as a cost of undertaking an IPO Optimal exercising of the option dictates that IPOs should only occur after price runups Firms never go public in a down market because the value of waiting is too great These incentives can lead to clustering of IPOs near market peaks The results generalize to seasoned issues Each equity offering is for a unique fraction of the total ownership claim for the firm and is associated with its own timing option Each equity issue is independent of all the others and therefore the timing of an offering is unaffected by subsequent issues Each equity issue is likely to follow an abnormal price increase Keywords IPO real option timing JEL Classification G G P A R T N

Washington DC USA Phone CoAuth PATTARAKE SARAJOTI Email Mailto Postal George Washington University Department of Finance G Street Washington DC USA ABSTRACT This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader proprietary positions to their market making activities In particular we examine interdealer trading its function as an inventory management tool and its costs In addition we develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy where some floor traders who are more successful profit from their trades with other dealers On average we find that dealers earn relative profits when they execute position reducing trades However a surprising finding is that more successful traders are more likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer hierarchy The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster and Manns article on futures floor trader inventory control and Reiss and Werners article on interdealer trading The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits from the elaborate futures data and the highly competitive nature of dealer trading on the floor Keywords Microstructure JEL

ABSTRACT In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer investors a superior riskreturn tradeoff We do so using a continuous time version of Dybvigs a b payoff distribution pricing model The evaluation model which does not require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution of the funds in question is applied to the monthly returns of hedge funds and hedge fund indices over the period May April The results show that as a standalone investment hedge funds do not offer a superior riskreturn profile We find indices and individual funds to be inefficient with the average efficiency loss amounting to per annum for indices and for individual funds Part of the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified away Funds of funds however are not the preferred vehicle for this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their double fee structure Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation outcomes Seven of the hedge fund indices and of the individual funds classified as inefficient on a standalone basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when mixed with the SP The best results are obtained when of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds JEL Classification G G P A R T N E R S in P U B L I S H I N G Editor and Subscription Information for Journals Carrying

KELLERHALS Email Mailto Postal Universitaet Tuebingen Dept of Finance Mohlstrasse D Tuebingen GERMANY Phone Fax ABSTRACT Based on the peculiarities of electricity as underlying commodity of forward contracts we develop a timecontinuous pricing model for shortterm electricity forwards The suggested stochastic volatility model utilizes the nontradeable spot price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables This enables us to capture the nonlinearities and the high and time varying volatility seen in electricity prices Using maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering

Washington DC USA Phone CoAuth PATTARAKE SARAJOTI Email Mailto Postal George Washington University Department of Finance G Street Washington DC USA ABSTRACT This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader proprietary positions to their market making activities In particular we examine interdealer trading its function as an inventory management tool and its costs In addition we develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy where some floor traders who are more successful profit from their trades with other dealers On average we find that dealers earn relative profits when they execute position reducing trades However a surprising finding is that more successful traders are more likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer hierarchy The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster and Manns article on futures floor trader inventory control and Reiss and Werners article on interdealer trading The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits from the elaborate futures data and the highly competitive nature of dealer trading on the floor Keywords Microstructure JEL

ABSTRACT In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer investors a superior riskreturn tradeoff We do so using a continuous time version of Dybvigs a b payoff distribution pricing model The evaluation model which does not require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution of the funds in question is applied to the monthly returns of hedge funds and hedge fund indices over the period May April The results show that as a standalone investment hedge funds do not offer a superior riskreturn profile We find indices and individual funds to be inefficient with the average efficiency loss amounting to per annum for indices and for individual funds Part of the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified away Funds of funds however are not the preferred vehicle for this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their double fee structure Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation outcomes Seven of the hedge fund indices and of the individual funds classified as inefficient on a standalone basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when mixed with the SP The best results are obtained when of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds JEL Classification G G P A R T N E R S in P U B L I S H I N G Editor and Subscription Information for Journals Carrying

to grab a few million eyeballs online youre going to have to write a check to for a zillion dollars or so and give it to a twentysomething kid whos managing a company that is haemorrhaging cash Or maybe youll get lucky and Yahoo will buy you Never has incumbency been worth less The Internet has turned bricks and mortar into millstones And venture capitalists pour millions of dollars into terrorist training camps for industry insurgents Consumers arent going to spend the rest of their lives wandering the soulless canyons of WalMart to save a couple of bucks on a hammer And all those big box retailers afloat in a sea of asphalt will one day find themselves out of the Internetenabled revolution With only one or two exceptions there is not a single market leader in the offline retailing world that leads its category online Most of the oldline companies just didnt move quickly enough Go to any grocery retailer and ask to see its strategic plan from a few years back Ill bet theres no mention of Bechtel as a potential competitor Yet the worlds largest construction company is helping Webvan a startup build a new distribution infrastructure that will support the home delivery of groceries ordered online Administrators posses an exaggerated confidence in great execution believing this is all you need to succeed in a discontinuous world I assume that the next edition of Garys book will contain a few more caveats and qualifiers such as but dont be dumb After FeaturesECorpThe Think Tank Inside The Revolution Smart Mover Dumb Mover Think the firstmover advantage is a myth Youre wrong Most pioneering dotcoms failed not because they were first but because they were dumb Gary Hamel Fortune Magazine Time Inc Page Copyright Im not fond of business aphorisms Bigger is better content is king own the customer cannibalize yourselfthese are just a few of the cliches that trivialize complex business issues Another is the idea of firstmover advantage with its promise of extraordinary rewards for any company that is first to market with a new service or product At the height of dotcom mania firstmover advantage was a nearsacred mantra for VCs and entrepreneurs alike Ecommerce zealots argued that early success would compound even more quickly on the Web than in the dawdling old economy Being first to build a consumer brand in a new category Amazon invent a new business model eBay or achieve critical mass what Webvan was hoping to do were seen as surefire routes to Midaslike profits In reality of course firstmover advantages proved illusory For most dotcom startups being first was simply a way to lose more faster Many pundits began to argue that being a fast follower was a better strategy than trying to be the leader Oldeconomy CEOs eager to avoid the hard work of strategic innovation seized upon this diagnosis to justify their instinctive fear of novelty Suddenly timidity was heralded as a virtue But the fastfollower advocates had it wrong as well Most Internet companies failed not because they were first movers but because they were dumb movers What companies should learn from the Internet debacle is not that being first is a dangerous form of hubris but that being dumb seldom succeeds When it comes to trailblazing there are at least three ways to be a dumb movernone of which is unique to Internet startups Dumb Getting your timing wrong If a company invests faster than it learns it will overdrive the opportunity and end up with an expensive and embarrassing failure Thats the fate that befell Apples pioneering handheld computer the Newton Was there a potential market out there for palm computers Sure Could investment and marketing hype alone force the market to develop on Apples time frame No Companies that overdrive an emerging opportunity often underdrive it later on The initial performance gap a product of unrealistic expectations and over investment produces a rapid retrenchmentand an opening for latecomers There is a marketpenetration curve for every emerging opportunity Typically this curve has an inflection point a moment when all the pieces of the business model finally fall into place customer demand explodes and the market takes off For videocassette recorders the curve began to slope gently upward with the launch of Matsushitas VHS format in the late s yet it would take another seven years for VCRs to find their way into one million American homes By contrast the marketpenetration curve for Hotmail was a near vertical line with more than ten million users signing up in the first months Matsushita ran a marathon Hotmail ran a sprint The Apple Newton might have evolved into something Palmlike but only if Apple had paced itself by spending less learning faster and iterating more quickly Apple blew the handheld opportunity not because it was the first mover but because it was a dumb mover Any management team that aspires to be a first mover must ask itself What race are we running sprint or marathon If you try to run a yard sprint like a marathon youll be left behind If you try to run a marathon like a yard sprint youll keel over from exhaustion So it is critically important to ask some questions Are there difficult technical hurdles Does market takeoff depend on the development of complementary products or services Will a new infrastructure be required Will customers need to learn new skills or adopt new behaviors Are there high switching costs for customers Will competing standards confuse customers Are there powerful competitors that will seek to delay or derail us If the answer to any of those questions is yes a company must be careful not to pour in too many resources too soon the race is going to be a marathon On the other hand answer yes to all of these questions and youll need to sprint out of the starting block Are the customer benefits clear and substantial Are there potential network effects that will accelerate takeoff Are there powerful competitors that will be compelled to follow Staying on the optimal penetration curveneither overdriving nor underdriving an opportunityis a neat trick but its not impossible AOL Sun Microsystems and Quickenmaker Intuit have all done it at one time or another Smart movers continually review their initial assumptions about the business model avoid the premium pricing and narrow market definition that create space for latecomers move quickly to collaborate with wouldbe competitors and outsource to maintain flexibility Dumber Overpaying for market share The allure of capturing a firstmover advantage often produces a spending orgy among a gaggle of lookalike competitors each intent on ramping up faster than its rivals That is exactly what happened in many areas of ecommerce Services were given away free ad budgets were doubled and then tripled and massive investments were made in IT infrastructureall in the quest of getting bigger faster In such cases its easy to overpay for market share To reap a firstmover advantage a company must buy market share at a discount That is it must be able to buy a big chunk of market share before its competitors figure out just how much that share will yield in future profits That is possible only if a company has a business idea that is truly original as did eBay and ICQ the Israeli company that invented instant messaging and was later acquired by AOL The fact is the Internet didnt produce too much in the way of authentic businessmodel innovation but rather too little And even when an original idea did surface it didnt stay original for long thanks to the incessant incestuous networking among Silicon Valleys venture capital companies The moral is simple If you want to profit from a firstmover advantage youd better make sure you start with a unique strategic insight that at least initially is unattractive to wouldbe competitors or protected by a wall of patents Dumb movers swarm smart movers dont Dumbest Being first with a business model thats DOA Petscom Iridium Webvan Northpoint Many business models are braindead from the getgo They breathe as long as they are hooked up to the ventilator of investor funds but expire the moment investors swallow their grief and pull the plug There are two fundamental flaws that can render a business model DOA a complete misreading of the customer does she really want to order dog food online and utterly unsound economics there will never be enough petroleum geologists and Arctic explorers to make satellite telephony pay Theres no advantage in being first if the destination aint worth the trip Not that this should be seen as an argument for always staying behind A stupid idea that fails is hardly an indictment of the notion of firstmover advantage Think twice before you let someone elses idiocy lull you into believing that being first is always a perilstrewn path Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first in overnight package delivery or Andy Grove at Intel microprocessors or Herb Kelleher at Southwest Airlines discount air travel or Pete Kight at CheckFree online billing and payment or Jeff Skilling at Enron energy trading I dont believe any company should set out to be a follower fast or otherwise Sure in hindsight first movers often look dumb but it would be imprudent to bet that they will always screw up Indeed when you look beyond the lunacy of the Internet bubble and consider companies with highquality management deep pockets and real competencies you find that being first pays off a surprisingly often So before you bet against the first mover youd be wise to ask yourself Am I sure the first mover is going to be a slow learner Will market penetration stay in single digits for some time to come giving me time to grab customers later on Will the rate of technology change remain high creating opportunities for a leapfrog strategy Will the first mover fail in signing up the most valuable partners If you can answer yes to all these questions then you may have the chance to be a successful second mover In the end the distinction between first mover and fast follower hides more than it reveals The goal after all is not to be first to market in some absolute sense but to be first to put together the precise combination of features value and sound business economics that unlocks a profitable new market Sometimes the company that does this is the first mover and sometimes it is not But its always the smart mover GARY HAMEL is chairman of Strategos a strategy consulting firm and author of Leading the Revolution FEEDBACK FORTUNEs Best Minds On EBusiness Quote The management team must ask itself What race are we running sprint or marathon Ask Fred Smith at FedEx if he was glad to be first Or Andy

Email intrusion detection By Jason Meserve Email Its one of the greatest inventions of our time despite the junk mail messages I get each day Still theres one problem The servers that deliver email also can become hacker gateways into corporate networks Traditional firewalls block a fair amount of malicious traffic but they allow email traffic in through Port SMTP Hackers know this and exploit it to gain access to the corporate goods Compounding the problem is that many mail servers run on Windows NT and as this newsletter has shown unless an administrator is ultravigilant in applying patches NT security can be as solid as Swiss cheese IronMail a new product from Cipher Trust is designed to help address this problem It complements a traditional firewall while providing intrusion detection specifically for mail systems The or rackunit appliance scans all incoming mail for viruses spam and other hacker threats such as buffer overflow and denialofservice flood attacks In the case of unusually long buffers IronMail truncates the string before passing the message off to the mail server preventing an overflow and crash on the server Also IronMail can proxy HTTP IMAP SMTP and POP as well as their secure equivalents Administrators can set up mail policies on the server such as adding a This email is company confidential footer to all outgoing messages or requiring encryption for messages sent to certain domains IronMail operates on a Pentiumbased appliance running an optimized version of the FreeBSD operating system The U unit sells for and the U unit for Spam

Kaminski Vince J Subject RE Reference request regarding Eric W Cope SR Vince Please find below some text for Erics letter I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter If you have questions or would like some other information please let me know Also on the question of Enron letterhead I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site Unless you have electronic letterhead the issue may be moot Martin Eric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of During this time Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills In all cases he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand While some direction was given in each case Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently and he executed the tasks very effectively One major project for the summer was to develop a webbrowserbased trading simulation platform TSP The TSP would create user accounts require user logons post simulated market information post simulated commidity prices accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users and track user account information such as positions order history and buying power The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices ficticious calculated prices or bidoffer prices based on some update algorithms The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure In short order a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin trading commodities The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin however the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues advertising media placement prices and longdistance voice telephony prices In many of the cases data were scarce as were definitive instructions Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach always in consultation and discussion with others but never with handholding or intense oversight His coworkers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Erics ability to take general direction and achieve productive results Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure such as we had Original Message From Kaminski Vince J Sent Friday January PM To Lin

a significant measure of time and attention on your part In this message we first describe below the three options for submittal of the letter and then in the final paragraphs you will find some comments about the nature of the job applied for We know your time is precious so we have tried to make the process as efficient as possible If you have access to a browser from your mailer then the easiest thing is to use the URL given below kblcgibinresumedocsSR Via this web page you can submit text html postscript or pdf files Please note that this URL should be used ONLY by you and ONLY for this particular student It is linked directly to the students resume and the processing occurs automatically and immediately If it is inconvenient to use the URL you may email your letter by replying to this email but please help us out if you use this option by sending the letter as plain text only not as a word processor file without indent and not as an attachment Also please make sure that your mailer includes the entire subject line in your reply message If you use this option please note that the processing of your letter will occur manually and therefore may entail a considerable delay Our system will format the emailed text appropriately for display unless you ask that it be treated as fixedformat As a third option if you prefer you may submit your letter as hard copy Please

the third year of undergraduate work through graduate school The summer projects vary in level depending on the student involved The students normally work in a oneonone fashion with a member of staff on some facet of the ongoing research work in the lab but they are expected to function somewhat independently after an initial period of familiarization with the work Accordingly we are interested in

Newsletter Dilbert Newsletter To Dogberts New Ruling Class DNRC From Scott Adams Date December Highlights New DNRC Word Boss and Coworker quotes Plop Version True Tales of Induhviduals My Holiday Message DNRC Update The members of DNRC continue to get smarter and better looking every day Case in point I am typing this newsletter using telekinesis while watching CNN in an adjoining room And if Im not mistaken Paula Zahn is trying to flirt with me New DNRC Word A DNRC member suggests this new word for Osamas terrorist organization AlQaeduh I would love to have been a fly in Osamas beard last year when he was discussing his plan for global conquest Osama I have an idea Lets attack the most powerful nation in the history of the universe and then hide in caves Omar All in favor say eye That might sound like a crazy plan to many of you but you need to realize that Osama grew up in Saudi Arabia where that sort of strategy has worked in the past In the November th issue of Newsweek theres a Special Advertising Section where Saudi Arabias public relations firm describes the wonderful history of Saudi Arabia In a guy named Ibn Saud along with his cousin and buddies climbed over the fortress wall in Riyadh and waited until the Amir came strolling by Then Ibn and his cousin hacked the Amir to death with swords At this point in the story so you dont think Im making up this whole thing I quote from Saudi Arabias own PR article The Riyadh garrison demoralized by the death of their leader and fearing they faced a far larger force than men surrendered Thats right Ibn conquered a whole city with men of which were just standing around watching Eventually the Saud family consolidated power named the country after themselves and formed a royal dynasty that is still in power Thats the inspirational story that little Osama learned in school when he was growing up Whos crazy now True Quotes from Induhviduals Here are more true quotes submitted by DNRC members Most of these are from managers As you will see Induhviduals are confused by anything involving critters or body parts Its an exercise in fertility Hindsight is Just use your own excretion You are never going to fail unless you try Were scraping the bottom of the iceberg Today is like the day Rome was built in We cant afford to have any fiddlers The project is going down the toilet in flames He might be barking at a red herring Youre treading on thin water I think he meant we should cross our Ts and dot our Is but it came out this way Be sure we all cross our eyes Hes as deaf as a bat We dont want to stick our necks out and get our asses chopped off I gave him a real mouthful I really took the bull by the hands He doesnt know his hole from an ass in the ground You should talk to her She is a minefield of information I cant remember but its right on the tip of my head You can lead a pig to pearls and then he trailed off Thanksgiving is early this year because the first Thursday fell on a Monday The skeleton is there You just have to sharpen it and put the decorations on the tree And this last quote which may or may not have come from Osama We need an escape goat Plop Version In case you ever decide to start your own comic strip and you want to solicit opinions from other people let me give you this piece of valuable advice You should never and I mean NEVER give the comic a name that rhymes with any of the following words Flop Drop Stop That little rhyming opportunity was not lost on about two hundred of you who thought Plop was not up to DNRC quality Fortunately some people actually liked Plop I read every comment and the breakdown looks roughly like this Loved it Liked it thought it has potential Loathed it Thats a great response for a first draft of a comic Comic strips normally get developed for several months before the public sees them Youre in on the ground floor Version of Plop incorporates many of your comments I renamed Plop because Plop was the name of a comic book in the past I changed Smokeys species I made Plop more optimistic I addressed the hipdeep mud question and I started to fill out the personalities of the main characters Only a few people were bothered by the physical similarity to the Taliban so Im not going to let that bother me if the comic develops into something worthwhile The new and improved strips are posted on the Web at comicsplop and begin with All comments and rhyming insults are appreciated Induhvidual Baby Names Here is further proof that all Induhviduals should be given the same name to keep things simple A doctor friend of mine was on hand for a delivery in a maternity unit The mother named her daughter Placenta I once knew a person with the tuneful name of Listerine My wife was a public social worker in South Carolina many years ago One of her case families had a daughter named Syphilis The family pronounced it in two parts SyphPhilis One day my wife asked the mother how they came to name the child Syph Philis The mother said the hospital named her and she got a copy of the birth certificate to prove it On the birth certificate was an annotation that the child was born of a mother with syphilis The mother assumed the hospital had named her child for her Editors note That one sounds like an urban legend to me Let me know if youve heard it before Saving the World Heres a fun mental exercise Try to think of any problem in the world that wouldnt be reduced if we all did some extra shopping this year How about terrorism Lets see if we shop a little extra that stimulates the economy which increases tax collections which pays for more security Tadah How about unemployment Shopping stimulated economy more hiring How about diseases Shopping stimulated economy funding for research So

Things Not To Say in a Restroom I hope this doesnt spawn a new category but these two reports were worth mentioning As I entered the restroom a coworker who had just finished his business turned to me and said Oh hey Brent I was just thinking about you At my last job just as I was entering a restroom a coworker said Say can I grab you when youre done True Tales of Induhviduals One of the young ladies in our office is getting ready for her dream vacation to Mount Rushmore My colleague asked her to bring him back a picture of the other side of the mountain When she asked why he proceeded to convince her that on the other side of Mount Rushmore are the backs of the presidents on their knees with their heads stuck into the mountain She is so excited that she is going to look for a special tour of the backside I went to a home improvement store to buy a new faucet for my kitchen sink I did not see the particular model I had in mind so I asked one of the Induhvidual employees for assistance He said We stopped selling that model because it was the number one theft item in the store I waited to hear the punchline until I realized he was serious I might have to find a new home improvement store if they ever achieve their goal of carrying no products worth stealing During a round of layoffs at the company a farewell card for one unfortunate coworker was circulated People were signing the card with good luck and Been great working with you and so on When the card got to the desk of one manager he did not bother to read the card He just wrote Happy Birthday and signed his name A pool hall put up a sign in their front window that read Profound language prohibited within I could just imagine some people discussing the meaning of life and being told to take it outside While traveling on business in Norfolk Nebraska I noticed a Ramada Inn sign Plan your next affair here The next day the sign was taken down At a business lunch platters of calamari were passed down the tables As a platter reached one of the employees wives she was heard to remark during an unfortunate lull in the conversation No thanks I never eat anything with testicles attached The stricken silence lasted a few moments Then people lost it I work in a camera store An Induhvidual came in and said his camera wasnt working and asked me if I could look at it I agreed and said I would check the battery first The Induhvidual said Ive had this battery for five years and Ive never had any problems with it before I changed the battery and the camera worked I would like to shove a live bear cub up my bosss nose and then have the mother bear go after him whenever he opens a phone conversation with Hi buddy hows it going yeah me too My boss was having a discussion with another employee about some work rules that pertain to people doing manual labor He said these rules dont apply to us because we dont use manuals Yesterday my boss called me and said Effective immediately I want you to stop your current activity and start working on this new area When I asked specifically what I was supposed to do he replied It was not my intention to give you a task today just a mindset My Holiday Message Ive written and rewritten this section a dozen times My problem is that no matter how much I write I keep condensing it down to the same thought This holiday season as we laugh and eat and shop and enjoy friends and family our soldiers are in Afghanistan risking everything for us Some of them wont come back The rest will never be the same Every one of them volunteered They think were worth it Lets prove them right Dilbert Fodder Whats bugging you about your job Let me know and you might see it in a Dilbert comic or newsletter The best comic fodder involves workplace peeves

free market agenda He is very highly regarded in the academic community Vince PS You will receive or have received already an invitation form the UofT at Austin to serve as a keynote speaker at the conference on energy finance and energy risk management they organize in Feb of Given our relationship with different department of UT and the number of students from the Business School we hire every year I recommend that you accept the invitation Original Message From Kaminski Vince J Sent Monday September AM To Frank A Wolak ENRON Cc Kaminski Vince J Subject RE Frank Thanks for your message I shall forward your comments to Greg I agree with you that its in the best interest of Enron and of the industry to invest in education of the public regarding the benefits that free energy markets produce for the society What I dont understand is that this message has to be repeated over and over again given all the evidence that the economic history of the th century produced The problem is that its a longterm effort that requires a lot of patience and a significant investment of time and human capital I think that the academic community can play an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process Vince Original Message From Frank A Wolak ENRON mailtoIMCEANOTESFrankAEWolakCwolakziaEstanfordEeduE NRONcom Sent Saturday September PM To Kaminski Vince J Subject Vince I meant to send this article to Greg as an example of why I think it is in his own financial interest to both explain to Wall Street and the public how these markets work and how Enron makes them work better but the events of September occurred and I dont have Gregs email address Wall Street and shareholders cant properly value what you are doing unless they understand what your are doing and why you are doing it I cant tell you how many reporters have called and asked me to comment on all of the terrible things Enron has done I then have to explain to them how markets work and debunk all of these terrible things Im probably very naive but I think just explaining to investors how these markets work would add value to Enrons stock because people would then see the economic sense in many of things it is doing Ill stop pestering you and Greg about this but Im very concerned that you may win the battle for competitive energy markets but lose the war because the public at large doesnt see where or how they can benefit from Enrons marketmaking innovations Frank SEP A SelfInflicted Wound Aggravates Angst Over Enron By ALEX BERENSON Something is rotten with the state of Enron Or so Wall Street suspects On Jan shares in Enron newsquote the giant energy trading company in Houston stood at On Friday Enron closed at down percent for the week and percent for the year The slide has destroyed more than billion in shareholder value In part the companys problems are beyond its control a result of the collapse in natural gas prices this year and investor fears of a coming glut in electricity But the deepest wound at Enron is selfinflicted Heavy insider selling indecipherable accounting practices and a stream of executive departures have combined to create a growing credibility gap between the company and Wall Street The stock is trading under a cloud says James S Chanos the president of Kynikos Associates a hedge fund in New York Mr Chanos began betting against Enron early this year and says he thinks that the companys shares remain overvalued Enrons problems came to a head on Aug when it announced that Jeffrey K Skilling the chief executive had quit for personal reasons With his resignation Mr Skilling joined a halfdozen other top Enron managers who have decided this year to pursue other opportunities Still the news came as a surprise because Mr Skilling was named to his post only in February Under the best of circumstances the unexpected departure of a chief executive rattles Wall Street But hardheaded investors can usually comfort themselves by toting up the sales and profits that the dearly departed poohbah has left behind Executives come and go but numbers are forever Unfortunately Enrons books offer investors little succor The complexity of the companys businesses and the way it reports its results make understanding Enrons financial statements essentially impossible Over the last decade Enron has transformed itself from a simple natural gas pipeline company into the worlds largest trader of electricity and gas Last year about threequarters of the companys cash flow came out of the companys wholesale services division which includes its trading operations But Enron keeps to itself the details of the trades it makes Are they shortterm or longterm Is the company hedged or does it make directional bets on the prices of the commodities it trades The answers are crucial because they determine how much risk Enron has taken to make its money Big profits are nice Big profits that come from big risky trades are a recipe for big unexpected writeoffs Enron also makes a habit of selling assets and securities to closely related companies in related party transactions The company says that the deals are comparable to those it makes with independent buyers and that they have been approved by its board and outside auditors But relatedparty deals can provide a convenient way for public companies to shift losses to private affiliates And Enrons disclosure about its relatedparty deals including billions of dollars in asset swaps with a partnership that until recently was controlled by the companys chief financial officer is notably sketchy In the good old days like last year companies could get away with the unlikeliest of accounting gimmicks as long as their revenue and profit numbers looked good But Wall Street has become more demanding as Enron is learning to its chagrin Mark Palmer a spokesman for Enron says the company is aware of investors concerns Weve got credibility issues on the street no question Mr Palmer says Were looking at a lot of ways to give our investors more information Sooner would be better than later
