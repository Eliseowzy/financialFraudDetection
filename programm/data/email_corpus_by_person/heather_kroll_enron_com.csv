undisclosedrecipients Subject On leadership archiveretrievecgiidSB djmtemplatedoclinktmpl November Managers Journal Beware the SelfPromoting CEO By Jim Collins Mr Collins is the author of Good to Great Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Dont HarperBusiness He operates a management research laboratory in Boulder Colo In December Carelton Fiorina appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine above a threeinch headline The Cult of Carly The article titled All Carly All the Time dubbed her activities the Carly Show It described how she launched Travels With Carly a global lecture tour aboard a million Gulfstream IV something that no previous HewlettPackard CEO had ever had not even David Packard or Bill Hewlett But of course Carly needed the Gulfstream to project her image worldwide Leadership is a performance she explained And perform she did The article detailed how she appeared widely on national television shows morning shows with Carly Tom Brokaw with Carly Japanese television with Carly and how she launched a million campaign with commercials featuring her talking about the innovative spirit of HP One was immediately left to wonder Whose brand was she building anyway It sure looked like the brand of Carly would soon eclipse the brand of HP The really striking point is that Ms Fiorina had been on the job less than six months before she posed for the cover of Forbes as a superhero savior She hadnt done anything significant And now two years later she still hasnt produced any significant results During her watch HP stock has fallen more than substantially underperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and SP and falling nearly twice as far as Apple IBM and Sun Microsystems over the same period These results combined with a negative reaction from the capital markets to the proposed Compaq merger put Carly in a tenuous position And now key members of the Hewlett and Packard families have lined up against her strategy in part because it runs counter to the core values that made HP great in the first place If Ms Fiorinas tenure proves to be a failure I hope not but the cards dont look good it will be the most highprofile failure of a woman CEO in history And the real tragedy will be that some people will pin the blame on the fact that she is a woman It just goes to show a woman cant handle a job like this I can hear them say But to say that Ms Fiorina is failing because she is a woman would be entirely the wrong conclusion Her failure has nothing to do with the fact that she is a woman and everything to do with the fact that she is the wrong type of leader Anyone who led like Carly would also likely fail A case in point is Mike Armstrong at ATT Like Ms Fiorina Mr Armstrong rode in as the great heroic savior Like Ms Fiorina he put on a good show and became a celebrity Like Ms Fiorina he allowed media hype about himself to overshadow the real nuts and bolts of what needed to be done Like Ms Fiorina he lurched after big splashy acquisitions despite the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the idea that a company can buy its way to greatness Two big mediocrities never make one great company And like Carleton Fiorina C Michael Armstrong has thus far failed to live up to outsized expectations The real issue at hand is not male or female but the type of leadership My research team and I recently completed a fiveyear research project in which we systematically analyzed leaders who took good companies and made them great All the goodtogreat leaders were the complete opposite of Ms Fiorina and Mr Armstrong They deflected attention away from themselves shunned the limelight and quietly focused on the tasks at hand One described himself as more plowhorse than showhorse an apt description of all the goodtogreat leaders we studied We learned in our research that the most effective leaders never make themselves the center of attention They are understated yet determined quiet yet forceful Most lack the liability of charisma Indeed the very best ones overwhelmed us not with their ego but with their humility They are ambitious to be sure but ambitious first and foremost for their institutions not for themselves Charles R Walgreen III for example transformed Walgreens from a mediocrity into a machine that produced cumulative stock returns that beat Intel by nearly two to one GE by nearly five to one and the general stock market by over times from to These results stem directly from Mr Walgreens stoic resolve to make a series of tough decisions such as jettisoning the entire foodservice business which dated back to his grandfather and was quite profitable because it was not an arena where Walgreens could be the absolute best in the world Few executives have the guts to get rid of profitable businesses where their company can only be good but never great Mr Walgreen not only had the guts but he made his decisions without fanfare quietly taking action based on understanding not bravado Yet despite these results not once did Mr Walgreen stand in front of the mirror and point to himself as a key factor preferring instead to point out the window to credit the great people he had on his team When we confronted him with the undeniable fact of stupendous results created under his leadership and pushed him to discuss his own role in getting great people to make those results happen he deflected again and pinned much of the credit for his success on being lucky Now you might be thinking But women leaders in a maledominated world cannot afford to be selfeffacing They need to show that they can be more Patton than Patton more Jack than Jack so that people will take them seriously Well think again Consider Katherine Graham of the Washington Post Company whose practical approach to leadership differed so dramatically from Ms Fiorinas that its as if they came from opposite ends of the solar system When Graham became president of the Washington Post she did not position herself as the great leader or savior In her own words she was terrified Shy awkward and socially fearful Graham did not launch The Katherine Tour or create The Cult of Katherine Reflecting on her early years atop the Post in her book Personal History she hardly gives herself any credit whatsoever writing that she was surprised even to land on her feet But as with Mr Walgreen if you were to interpret Katherine Grahams genuine personal humility as a sign of weakness you would be terribly mistaken Just ask members of the Nixon White House who were brought down in large part because of her courage to stand absolutely firm behind her reporters in their pursuit of the Watergate story Even so she pinned the success principally on other people the enduring core values of the Post and good luck In a single paragraph summarizing the whole Watergate episode she uses the word luck or lucky nine times The only time she uses the pronoun I is to deflect acclamation for her courage Katie and Carly One took a good company and made it great the other has thus far taken a great company and made it good One embodied the type of leadership required for true greatness the other has thus far shown the type of leadership that erodes greatness One saw the purpose of it all as far beyond herself the other has acted as if the supreme purpose is herself I hope that Carly Fiorina grows into the type of leader that is required to take a company from good to great a type epitomized by Charles Walgreen and Katherine Graham and thereby leads HP back to greatness But if she does not her failure lies in her inability to become such a leader and not in the utterly irrelevant fact that she is a woman URL for this Article archiveretrievecgiidSB djm Copyright c Dow Jones

To undisclosedrecipients Subject Travel Plans Postcard from Faizabad Oct th FAIZABAD From The Economist Cities Guide ANYONE planning to visit Faizabad provisional capital of the northern nonTaliban part of Afghanistan had better be well prepared Assuming that you want to visit the main city in the poorest province of the poorest country in Eurasia heres what to do How to get there Faizabad is not served by scheduled transport of any form The least uncomfortable way of reaching it is by an elderly Soviet military plane which makes an occasional run from Dushanbe the capital of neighbouring Tajikistan The round trip is although no return flights are currently scheduled If you are desperate to return keep handy in cash You may be able to persuade the pilot to drop you off at Dushanbe when he flies his return leg which is to a Russian military base in Tajikistan where the plane is maintained For flight details join the queue of journalists chancers and dogooders clustered outside the Afghan embassy on Bakhtar Street Dushanbe You will need a return Tajik visa a letter from a western organisation accrediting you and a Tajik government pass obtainable from the Tajik ministry of foreign affairs These formalities including an Afghan visa take two or three days after which you can start haggling for a place on the plane Your chance of getting one of these places will depend on your importance persistence charm and good luck The only alternatives are a by land from Pakistan This involves crossing a metrehigh pass on a donkey and is impossible in winter The border is currently closed but porous for those with enough money b by land from Khoja Bahauddin the military headquarters This is a boneshaking tenhour ride on very bad roads To get to Khoja you need a helicopter If you have friends at CNN you may be able to get a place on one of their flights If not join the queue at the Afghan embassy in Dushanbe Arrival Faizabad airport is a desolate former Soviet military airstrip surrounded by a few ruined huts There are no facilities of any kind You will be met by a jeep and taken to the socalled Club which is a guesthouse for visiting foreigners There is another hotel The Star for guests of the government Accommodation If you are lucky you will be sleeping six or eight to a room at the Club on thin mattresses If you are unlucky you will be sleeping in the corridor or outside Bring your own sleeping bag preferably a very warm one in case you are in the garden Other things to remember include a thin foam mattress a mosquito net a towel soap lavatory paper water and waterpurifying equipment satellite telephone several thousand dollars in small denomination bills and a flak jacket Booking ahead of time for the Club is impossible but you may be able to send a message via the Afghan embassy in Dushanbe Communications Faizabads phone system dates from before the second world war There is a publicly available satellite telephone at the telephone exchange in the new town open daily ampm as well as a shortwave radio in the old town post office near the police station in the bazaar main square that can be used for calling other towns in the region including Dushanbe Eating and drinking The menu at the Club does not vary bread tea and curds for breakfast Plov rice with meat for lunch and dinner You can buy supplementary food in the bazaar The carrots are delicious as are the raisins and dried apricots The fiery local hot peppers may kill the local intestinal parasites before they start trying to kill you Language The locals speak Dari a dialect of Persian English is spoken very little However everyone will ask you how you are and what is your name even if they dont understand the answer Useful words phrases Man Mikheim I would like Chai tea Teshekur thanks Berem Lets go For about a day you can have a translator The best one who has studied English in Pakistan is called Fawad He can be contacted through the hotel Sanitary arrangements There is no running water in the hotel or indeed anywhere in Faizabad The standpipe water is piped from the mountain and has been tested for potability by Oxfam It is probably better to stick to tea or the two dozen bottles of water you have wisely brought with you Washing in the hotel can be done outside from a cistern of fresh water which the bodyguards find highly amusing or in the washroom inside the hotel which is less salubrious You may be able to cadge a tin of warm water for shaving There is no mains electricity supply At the time of writing the hotel generator was running for about four or five hours in the evening You should use this opportunity to charge satellite phones camera batteries laptops or anything else It is wise to bring an inverter available from hardware stores with which you can convert electricity from a car cigarette lighter to mains current Sightseeing The most fascinating sights in Faizabad are in the bazaar You can buy for example a vintage Lee Enfield rifle complete with ammunition at the kiosk in the alley running down to the left of the police station There is an antique shop half way up the main street in the bazaar on the righthand side going away from the hotel where you can buy lapis lazuli jewellery and other local handicrafts An Afghan petu wrap is a good investment against the cold especially if you have to sleep outside There are also attractive hats Pakols but these will lead to death or imprisonment if worn in the Talibancontrolled parts of the country Entertainment Faizabad has the only television station in Afghanistan It broadcasts for three hours every evening Sit in a teahouse in the bazaar and drink in the atmosphere or go the to the mosque During Friday prayers you can hear the Burhanuddin Rabbani who lives in Faizabad speak Mr Rabbani is president of the internationally recognised government of Afghanistan which controls between a tenth and a fifth of the country Expeditions Leaving Faizabad is possible with a governmentapproved driver check at the hotel You can go and see the lapis lazuli mine which is about a days drive away or visit the Pansjir valley currently the scene of desultory fighting Ask at the hotel for details and expect to pay per day for a jeep and driver depending on the kind of car and the danger of the expedition Kill an hour The nicest expedition is to cross the river at the bridge below the Club and then turn right walking about km along the precipitous parapet of the newly built freshwater canal You will then reach an interesting forestry project deforestation in Afghanistan is terrifying and a water wheel Continue on and you are in the new town where you can hobnob with any remaining foreigners or make a call from the municipal satellite telephone Then cross the river and you will arrive in the middle of the bazaar Turn right and head down through the ford up the hill turn right at the petrol tankers take care not to be splashed as they decant petrol from the big cisterns into little cans and you will arrive back at the hotel At a gentle pace this takes about minutes Social customs Although women may work and girls can go to school the sexes are strictly segregated in public If you have made Afghan male friends do not expect them to introduce you to their womenfolk Women visitors should not smoke in public and should dress as modestly as possible Such crumbs of westernstyle sociallife as exist are among the handful of intrepid foreigners still resident here They all live and work in the same street in the new town easily identified by their organisations emblems Red Cross Medicins sans Frontires etc Currency The local currency is the Afghani northern version which trades at about to the dollar The largest denomination is It is better to change small amounts of money As well as the US dollar Tajik Iranian and Pakistani money is easy to change There are no banks see article Mullah moolah October th Medical care Medicins sans Frontires has a hospital Apart from that youre on your own
