Right after wed discussed my companys mark to market accounting in class on Monday this article showed up on Wednesday Thought you might be interested TEXAS JOURNAL Energy Traders Cite Gains But Some Math Is Missing By Jonathan Weil Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating highvoltage earnings growth at some companies with large energytrading units But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately And some of the biggest players are in Houston the center of the energytrading industry Dynegy Incs stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at and now trades for times what analysts project the companys earnings will be according to First CallThomson Financial Shares of Enron Corp the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America have nearly doubled this year to or times earnings Meanwhile El Paso Energy Corps stock has jumped this year to or times earnings Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets Naturalgas prices have more than doubled in the past year while supplies have tightened And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixedprice contracts generating large premiums for traders But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies recent profits constitute unrealized noncash gains Frequently these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors the details of which the companies do not provide and which time may prove wrong And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases its difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions and force earnings revisions There could be a qualityofearnings issue says Tom Linsmeier an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University who coauthored the US Securities and Exchange Commissions rules on marketrisk disclosures for financial instruments There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning lockedin gain to not arise sometime in the future The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energyrelated contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods sometimes stretching over more than years Socalled marktomarket accounting is mandated by accountingrule makers when companies have outstanding energyrelated contracts on their books at the end of a quarter such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices Under those rules companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings If for instance the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a companys contract to buy gas generally the company will record an unrealized gain That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the companys balance sheet At the end of each quarter the contract is revalued The value of the previously recorded asset is increased and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income Conversely if the market value for gas falls and the value of the contract has declined any change in the contracts value is recorded on the companys balance sheet and a loss is recorded on its income statement e Yet in their financial reports the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fairvalue estimates on the contracts Increasingly quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future However with some longterm derivative instruments particularly electricity contracts future market prices dont extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts And in those cases companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates assumptions and pricing models Ultimately theyre telling you what they think the answer is but theyre not telling you how they got to that answer says Stephen Campbell an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas That is essentially saying trust me Accountingrule makers at the Financial Accounting Standards Board have debated the subject of how to value energyrelated contracts extensively in recent months Two companies in similar circumstances might apply different methods to estimate the fair value of their energyrelated contracts and may arrive at widely different values an FASB task force studying the issue wrote in a June report Those differences lead to the question of whether some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not representative of fair value Despite this concern FASB isnt inclined to offer any explicit guidance for how such contracts should be valued There are just too many models and too many different types of instruments for us to have a onesizefitsall type of model explains Timothy Lucas FASBs director of research in Norwalk Conn One way to determine the size of a companys unrealized gains is to compare the change in the values of net assets from riskmanagement activities from quarter to quarter Some companies also disclose how much theyre adjusting their cashflow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked as earnings Thats how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at Dynegy and Enron for example the two companies confirm A reporters examination of Dynegys financial filings shows the companys earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from riskmanagement activities For its most recent quarter ended June Dynegy reported earnings of cents a diluted share of which came from unrealized gains the company confirms The companys pershare earnings would have been cents higher if not for a onetime stock dividend For all of Dynegy recorded million in unrealized gains accounting for of its earnings Enron confirms it booked million in unrealized gains from riskmanagement activities during the second quarter more than the companys total million in earnings before interest and taxes Absent unrealized gains the company would have reported a quarterly loss For the quarter the company reported earnings of cents a diluted share up from a year earlier But not all companies disclose enough information for investors to calculate how large their unrealized gains are El Paso says thats the case with its own quarterly reports which disclose shortterm assets and liabilities from riskmanagement activities but not longterm riskmanagement assets and liabilities For the second quarter El Paso reported that its energy marketing and trading unit earned million before interest and taxes times what it earned a year earlier In an interview El Pasos chief financial officer Brent Austin says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total He says most of the cash from those gains will materialize within a year In its financial reports Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some contract valuations It explains that with some longterm contracts for which marketprice quotes arent available the lack of longterm pricing liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments using historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing curves Dynegy cautions that actual cash returns may vary either positively or negatively from the results estimated But like Enron El Paso and others Dynegy provides scant details about its mathematical models such as the assumptions they use for market volatility and longterm price forecasts for natural gas and electricity Nor is the company required to disclose more The disclosure mentions risks says John Cassidy an analyst who tracks Dynegy for Moodys Investors Service in New York But I dont know that the disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk there is El Pasos filings warn that because the valuation of these financial instruments can involve estimates changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates can occur changing our valuation and potentially resulting in financial losses Enron cautions that the values it assigns to various transactions are based on managements best estimate The companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum potential singleday riskmanagement losses might be figures that also are based on various undisclosed market assumptions But energy traders cite competitive reasons for not disclosing more You dont necessarily want to tip off everyone to what youre doing says John Harrison chief financial officer for El Pasos merchantenergy unit Echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders Enrons executive vice president and chief accounting officer Richard Causey says Enron runs a relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his companys valuations are conservative In large part he says those estimates are based on quoted market prices where available Where theyre not available Mr Causey says Enron bases its estimates in part on longterm pricing trends as well as the companys own trading experience which dates to Further Mr Causey says Enrons unrealized gains dont depend heavily on gains from longterm contracts that extend beyond the periods for which market quotes are available reducing the potential for significant earnings revisions The average length of Enrons riskmanagement contracts is just two years he says To be sure though some of Enrons electricity contracts extend for years Were getting the cash in quicker than you might think Mr Causey says They dont stay unrealized very long El Paso says its contracts have an average life of six years with some running as long as years Dynegy says the longest riskmanagement contracts for which it uses marktomarket accounting are years though it doesnt disclose an average length Dynegys chief financial officer Robert Doty says of the companys gas contracts close out by while of its power contracts expire by The cash will come in he says As for why the company doesnt disclose the extent of any bias bullish or bearish it has in the market Dynegy executives say that information like the estimates behind its mathematical models is proprietary Such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings says Michael Mott a Dynegy vice president Mr Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to But we dont see that would be in the best interests of shareholders Mr Mott says because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now Mr Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late s though he emphasizes its too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar Using socalled gainonsale accounting a form of marktomarket accounting those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made rather than having to wait for them to be paid off as banks typically do But as interest rates fell in many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected slashing lenders profit margins Compounding matters the market for mortgagebacked securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans Many investors complained they were blindsided in part because these lenders generally hadnt disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables After the crash subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios At New York University accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodityprice movements on the values of their riskmanagement assets and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodityprice movements ingrained in their mathematical models Says Mr Lev I would like to see much more disclosure particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings Document Released on EST
