announced today that it has reached an agreement with most of its renewable Qualifying Facilities QF power producers that addresses past payment issues and future pricing considerations and creates a mechanism for ending numerous lawsuits We believe this agreement will help bring stability to an important segment of Californias energy market said SCE Chairman President CEO Stephen E Frank The plan was negotiated between the utility and key representatives of the QF industry and facilitated by Governor Gray Davis office To date SCE has received signed agreements from QFs representing approximately of its renewable energy capacity and today executed those contracts The company hopes that the small number of remaining producers will also agree Certain elements of the agreements are subject to the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission The plan calls for generators to provide power at a fixed price centskWh over the next five years eliminating some of the price volatility that has plagued Californias energy markets during the current crisis The plan stays all existing legal action and assures that no new legal action will be initiated unless the terms of the agreement are not met The people of Edison are committed to pursuing the benefits of negotiated practical solutions to Californias energy crisis said Frank The QF agreement and the MOU if approved are
