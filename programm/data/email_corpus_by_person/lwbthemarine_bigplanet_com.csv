Subject Fw Winning the cultural war Original Message From Ted Carla To Mike Ferguson Sent Thursday January PM Subject Winning the cultural war Mike here is the speach by Charlton Heston that I was telling you about Subject Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston Date Tue Mar From Koenigs International News To Note from Bill Koenig Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard Rush Limbaugh today said he has received email requests for a copy It is entitled Winning the Cultural War and was given at the Harvard Law School Forum February I remember my son when he was explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living My Daddy he said pretends to be people There have been quite a few of them Prophets from the Old and New Testaments a couple of Christian saints generals of various nationalities and different centuries several kings three American presidents a French cardinal and two geniuses including Michelangelo If you want the ceiling repainted Ill do my best There always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here Im never sure which one of them gets to talk Right now I guess Im the guy As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty your own freedom of thought your own compass for what is right Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg Abraham Lincoln said of America We are now engaged in a great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure Those words are true again I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war a cultural war thats about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is Let me back up About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association which protects the right to keep and bear arms I ran for office I was elected and now I serve I serve as a moving target for the media whove called me everything from ridiculous and duped to a braininjured senile crazy old man I know Im pretty old but I sure thank the Lord aint senile As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms Ive realized that firearms are not the only issue No its much much bigger than that Ive come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land in which with Orwellian fervor certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated For example I marched for civil rights with Dr King in long before Hollywood found it fashionable But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone elses pride they called me a racist Ive worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights I was called a homophobe I served in World War II against the Axis powers But during a speech when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners I was called an antiSemite Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution I was compared to Timothy McVeigh From Time magazine to friends and colleagues theyre essentially saying Chuck how dare you speak your mind You are using language not authorized for public consumption But I am not afraid If Americans believed in political correctness wed still be King Georges boyssubjects bound to the British crown In his book The End of Sanity Martin Gross writes that blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor There seem to be new customs new rules new antiintellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction Underneath the nation is roiling Americans know something without a name is undermining the nation turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong And they dont like it Let me read a few examples At Antioch college in Ohio young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive In New Jersey despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIVpositive need not need not tell their patients that they are infected At William and Mary students tried to change the name of the school team The Tribe because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name In San Francisco city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to crossdress on the job and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery In New York City kids who dont speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three Rs in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic At the University of Pennsylvania in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students Yeah I know thats out of bounds now Dr King said Negroes Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said black But its a nono now For me hyphenated identities are awkward particularly NativeAmerican Im a Native American for Gods sake I also happen to be a bloodinitiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux On my wifes side my grandson is a thgeneration Native American with a capital letter on American Finally just last month David Howard head of the Washington DC Office of Public Advocate used the word niggardly while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters Of course niggardly means stingy or scanty But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign As columnist Tony Snow wrote David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who a didnt know the meaning of niggardly b didnt know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning and actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance What does all of this mean It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say so telling us what to do cant be far behind Before you claim to be a champion of free thought tell me Why did political correctness originate on Americas campuses And why do you continue to tolerate it Why do you whore supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression Lets be honest Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe It scares me to death and should scare you too that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason You are the best and the brightest You here in the fertile cradle of American academia here in the castle of learning on the Charles River you are the cream But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge And as long as you validate that and abide it you areby your grandfathers standardscowards Heres another example Right now at more than one major university Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or theyll lose their jobs Why Because their research findings would undermine bigcity mayors pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers I dont care what you think about guns But if you are not shocked at that I am shocked at you Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you Who will defend the core value of academia if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead Dont shoot me If you talk about race it does not make you a racist If you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist If you think critically about a denomination it does not make you antireligion If you accept but dont celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe Dont let Americas universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism But what can you do How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation The answers been here all along I learned it years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC standing with Dr Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people You simply disobey Peaceably yes Respectfully of course Nonviolently absolutely But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we dont We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr King who learned it from Gandhi and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might Disobedience is in our DNA We feel innate kinship with that Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor that sent Thoreau to jail that refused to sit in the back of the bus that protested a war in Vietnam In that same spirit I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom But be careful it hurts Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk Dr King stood on lots of balconies You must be willing to be humiliated to endure the modernday equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma You must be willing to experience discomfort Im not Complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me Let me tell you a story A few years back I heard about a rapper named IceT who was selling a CD called Cop Killer celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers It was being marketed by none other than TimeWarner the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world Police across the country were outraged Rightfully soat least one had been murdered But TimeWarner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black I heard TimeWarner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills I owned some shares at the time so I decided to attend What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues I asked for the floor To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders I simply read the full lyrics of Cop Killerevery vicious vulgar instructional word I GOT MY GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF Im ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF Im ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF It got worse a lot worse I wont read the rest of it to you But trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces The TimeWarner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes They hated me for that Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth where IceT fantasizes about sodomizing two year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY Well I wont do to you here what I did to them Lets just say I left the room in echoing silence When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps one of them said We cant print that I know I replied but TimeWarner s selling it Two months later TimeWarner terminated IceTs contract Ill never be offered another film by Warners or get a good review from Time magazine But disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself jam the switchboard of the district attorneys office When your university is pressured to lower standards until percent of the students graduate with honors choke the halls of the board of regents When an yearold boy pecks a girls cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its doorways When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you petition them oust them banish them When Time magazines cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month boycott their magazine and the products it advertises So that this nation may long endure I urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles founded religions defeated tyrants and yes in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men by Gods grace built this country If Dr King were here I think he would agree Thank you atthtm

Gene Adams George Sent Monday November AM Subject Fw What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Original Message From Concerned Jeffrey Anderson To Sent Friday November AM Subject What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Are we having fun embarrassing our Nation Mr Gore What do you hope to prove cry baby Its getting nasty What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Al Gores campaign chairman William Daley has indicated that if the recount shows a Bush victory Gore will not concede Daley together with Warren Christopher have suggested that they will take the situation to the courts In case the Democrats refuse to relinquish power here is a suggested course of action United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago November From Joseph A Morris President To URF Leaders and Friends Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice Presidents Senate Office telephone Senator Tom Daschle Senate Democratic Leader Also Representative Dick Gephardt House Democratic Leader Also Also be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators All these numbers are easily located on votercom You can also contact them

Daley Telephone FAX If youve never made a call like this theres no reason to be shy They get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them In fact they like calls It helps them tell which way

What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Are we having fun embarrassing our Nation Mr Gore What do you hope to prove cry baby Its getting nasty What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Al Gores campaign chairman William Daley has indicated that if the recount shows a Bush victory Gore will not concede Daley together with Warren Christopher have suggested that they will take the situation to the courts In case the Democrats refuse to relinquish power here is a suggested course of action United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago November From Joseph A Morris President To URF Leaders and Friends Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice Presidents Senate Office telephone Senator Tom Daschle Senate Democratic Leader Also Representative Dick Gephardt House Democratic Leader Also Also be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators All these numbers are easily located on votercom You can also contact them

Daley Telephone FAX If youve never made a call like this theres no reason to be shy They get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them In fact they like calls It helps them tell which way

Subject Fw Winning the cultural war Original Message From Ted Carla To Mike Ferguson Sent Thursday January PM Subject Winning the cultural war Mike here is the speach by Charlton Heston that I was telling you about Subject Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston Date Tue Mar From Koenigs International News To Note from Bill Koenig Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard Rush Limbaugh today said he has received email requests for a copy It is entitled Winning the Cultural War and was given at the Harvard Law School Forum February I remember my son when he was explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living My Daddy he said pretends to be people There have been quite a few of them Prophets from the Old and New Testaments a couple of Christian saints generals of various nationalities and different centuries several kings three American presidents a French cardinal and two geniuses including Michelangelo If you want the ceiling repainted Ill do my best There always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here Im never sure which one of them gets to talk Right now I guess Im the guy As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty your own freedom of thought your own compass for what is right Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg Abraham Lincoln said of America We are now engaged in a great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure Those words are true again I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war a cultural war thats about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is Let me back up About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association which protects the right to keep and bear arms I ran for office I was elected and now I serve I serve as a moving target for the media whove called me everything from ridiculous and duped to a braininjured senile crazy old man I know Im pretty old but I sure thank the Lord aint senile As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms Ive realized that firearms are not the only issue No its much much bigger than that Ive come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land in which with Orwellian fervor certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated For example I marched for civil rights with Dr King in long before Hollywood found it fashionable But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone elses pride they called me a racist Ive worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights I was called a homophobe I served in World War II against the Axis powers But during a speech when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners I was called an antiSemite Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution I was compared to Timothy McVeigh From Time magazine to friends and colleagues theyre essentially saying Chuck how dare you speak your mind You are using language not authorized for public consumption But I am not afraid If Americans believed in political correctness wed still be King Georges boyssubjects bound to the British crown In his book The End of Sanity Martin Gross writes that blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor There seem to be new customs new rules new antiintellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction Underneath the nation is roiling Americans know something without a name is undermining the nation turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong And they dont like it Let me read a few examples At Antioch college in Ohio young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive In New Jersey despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIVpositive need not need not tell their patients that they are infected At William and Mary students tried to change the name of the school team The Tribe because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name In San Francisco city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to crossdress on the job and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery In New York City kids who dont speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three Rs in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic At the University of Pennsylvania in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students Yeah I know thats out of bounds now Dr King said Negroes Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said black But its a nono now For me hyphenated identities are awkward particularly NativeAmerican Im a Native American for Gods sake I also happen to be a bloodinitiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux On my wifes side my grandson is a thgeneration Native American with a capital letter on American Finally just last month David Howard head of the Washington DC Office of Public Advocate used the word niggardly while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters Of course niggardly means stingy or scanty But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign As columnist Tony Snow wrote David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who a didnt know the meaning of niggardly b didnt know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning and actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance What does all of this mean It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say so telling us what to do cant be far behind Before you claim to be a champion of free thought tell me Why did political correctness originate on Americas campuses And why do you continue to tolerate it Why do you whore supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression Lets be honest Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe It scares me to death and should scare you too that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason You are the best and the brightest You here in the fertile cradle of American academia here in the castle of learning on the Charles River you are the cream But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge And as long as you validate that and abide it you areby your grandfathers standardscowards Heres another example Right now at more than one major university Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or theyll lose their jobs Why Because their research findings would undermine bigcity mayors pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers I dont care what you think about guns But if you are not shocked at that I am shocked at you Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you Who will defend the core value of academia if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead Dont shoot me If you talk about race it does not make you a racist If you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist If you think critically about a denomination it does not make you antireligion If you accept but dont celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe Dont let Americas universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism But what can you do How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation The answers been here all along I learned it years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC standing with Dr Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people You simply disobey Peaceably yes Respectfully of course Nonviolently absolutely But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we dont We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr King who learned it from Gandhi and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might Disobedience is in our DNA We feel innate kinship with that Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor that sent Thoreau to jail that refused to sit in the back of the bus that protested a war in Vietnam In that same spirit I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom But be careful it hurts Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk Dr King stood on lots of balconies You must be willing to be humiliated to endure the modernday equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma You must be willing to experience discomfort Im not Complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me Let me tell you a story A few years back I heard about a rapper named IceT who was selling a CD called Cop Killer celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers It was being marketed by none other than TimeWarner the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world Police across the country were outraged Rightfully soat least one had been murdered But TimeWarner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black I heard TimeWarner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills I owned some shares at the time so I decided to attend What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues I asked for the floor To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders I simply read the full lyrics of Cop Killerevery vicious vulgar instructional word I GOT MY GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF Im ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF Im ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF It got worse a lot worse I wont read the rest of it to you But trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces The TimeWarner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes They hated me for that Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth where IceT fantasizes about sodomizing two year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY Well I wont do to you here what I did to them Lets just say I left the room in echoing silence When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps one of them said We cant print that I know I replied but TimeWarner s selling it Two months later TimeWarner terminated IceTs contract Ill never be offered another film by Warners or get a good review from Time magazine But disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself jam the switchboard of the district attorneys office When your university is pressured to lower standards until percent of the students graduate with honors choke the halls of the board of regents When an yearold boy pecks a girls cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its doorways When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you petition them oust them banish them When Time magazines cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month boycott their magazine and the products it advertises So that this nation may long endure I urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles founded religions defeated tyrants and yes in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men by Gods grace built this country If Dr King were here I think he would agree Thank you atthtm

Subject Fw Winning the cultural war Original Message From Ted Carla To Mike Ferguson Sent Thursday January PM Subject Winning the cultural war Mike here is the speach by Charlton Heston that I was telling you about Subject Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston Date Tue Mar From Koenigs International News To Note from Bill Koenig Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard Rush Limbaugh today said he has received email requests for a copy It is entitled Winning the Cultural War and was given at the Harvard Law School Forum February I remember my son when he was explaining to his kindergarten class what his father did for a living My Daddy he said pretends to be people There have been quite a few of them Prophets from the Old and New Testaments a couple of Christian saints generals of various nationalities and different centuries several kings three American presidents a French cardinal and two geniuses including Michelangelo If you want the ceiling repainted Ill do my best There always seem to be a lot of different fellows up here Im never sure which one of them gets to talk Right now I guess Im the guy As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me If my creator gave me the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those great men then I want to use that same gift now to reconnect you with your own sense of liberty your own freedom of thought your own compass for what is right Dedicating the memorial at Gettysburg Abraham Lincoln said of America We are now engaged in a great Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure Those words are true again I believe that we are again engaged in a great civil war a cultural war thats about to hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside you the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into the miracle that it is Let me back up About a year ago I became president of the National Rifle Association which protects the right to keep and bear arms I ran for office I was elected and now I serve I serve as a moving target for the media whove called me everything from ridiculous and duped to a braininjured senile crazy old man I know Im pretty old but I sure thank the Lord aint senile As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms Ive realized that firearms are not the only issue No its much much bigger than that Ive come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land in which with Orwellian fervor certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated For example I marched for civil rights with Dr King in long before Hollywood found it fashionable But when I told an audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride or red pride or anyone elses pride they called me a racist Ive worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life But when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no further than your rights or my rights I was called a homophobe I served in World War II against the Axis powers But during a speech when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews and singling out innocent gun owners I was called an antiSemite Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my country But when I asked an audience to oppose this cultural persecution I was compared to Timothy McVeigh From Time magazine to friends and colleagues theyre essentially saying Chuck how dare you speak your mind You are using language not authorized for public consumption But I am not afraid If Americans believed in political correctness wed still be King Georges boyssubjects bound to the British crown In his book The End of Sanity Martin Gross writes that blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the norm in almost every area of human endeavor There seem to be new customs new rules new antiintellectual theories regularly foisted on us from every direction Underneath the nation is roiling Americans know something without a name is undermining the nation turning the mind mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right from wrong And they dont like it Let me read a few examples At Antioch college in Ohio young men seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive In New Jersey despite the death of several patients nationwide who had been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS the state commissioner announced that health providers who are HIVpositive need not need not tell their patients that they are infected At William and Mary students tried to change the name of the school team The Tribe because it was supposedly insulting to local Indians only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs truly like the name In San Francisco city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the rights of transvestites to crossdress on the job and for transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing sex change surgery In New York City kids who dont speak a word of Spanish have been placed in bilingual classes to learn their three Rs in Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic At the University of Pennsylvania in a state where thousands died at Gettysburg opposing slavery the president of that college officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students Yeah I know thats out of bounds now Dr King said Negroes Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said black But its a nono now For me hyphenated identities are awkward particularly NativeAmerican Im a Native American for Gods sake I also happen to be a bloodinitiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux On my wifes side my grandson is a thgeneration Native American with a capital letter on American Finally just last month David Howard head of the Washington DC Office of Public Advocate used the word niggardly while talking to colleagues about budgetary matters Of course niggardly means stingy or scanty But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and resign As columnist Tony Snow wrote David Howard got fired because some people in public employ were morons who a didnt know the meaning of niggardly b didnt know how to use a dictionary to discover the meaning and actually demanded that he apologize for their ignorance What does all of this mean It means that telling us what to think has evolved into telling us what to say so telling us what to do cant be far behind Before you claim to be a champion of free thought tell me Why did political correctness originate on Americas campuses And why do you continue to tolerate it Why do you whore supposed to debate ideas surrender to their suppression Lets be honest Who here thinks your professors can say what they really believe It scares me to death and should scare you too that the superstition of political correctness rules the halls of reason You are the best and the brightest You here in the fertile cradle of American academia here in the castle of learning on the Charles River you are the cream But I submit that you and your counterparts across the land are the most socially conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge And as long as you validate that and abide it you areby your grandfathers standardscowards Heres another example Right now at more than one major university Second Amendment scholars and researchers are being told to shut up about their findings or theyll lose their jobs Why Because their research findings would undermine bigcity mayors pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers I dont care what you think about guns But if you are not shocked at that I am shocked at you Who will guard the raw material of unfettered ideas if not you Who will defend the core value of academia if you supposed soldiers of free thought and expression lay down your arms and plead Dont shoot me If you talk about race it does not make you a racist If you see distinctions between the genders it does not make you a sexist If you think critically about a denomination it does not make you antireligion If you accept but dont celebrate homosexuality it does not make you a homophobe Dont let Americas universities continue to serve as incubators for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism But what can you do How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation The answers been here all along I learned it years ago on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC standing with Dr Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand people You simply disobey Peaceably yes Respectfully of course Nonviolently absolutely But when told how to think or what to say or how to behave we dont We disobey social protocol that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr King who learned it from Gandhi and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great man who led those in the right against those with the might Disobedience is in our DNA We feel innate kinship with that Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor that sent Thoreau to jail that refused to sit in the back of the bus that protested a war in Vietnam In that same spirit I am asking you to disavow cultural correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority social directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom But be careful it hurts Disobedience demands that you put yourself at risk Dr King stood on lots of balconies You must be willing to be humiliated to endure the modernday equivalent of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma You must be willing to experience discomfort Im not Complaining but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me Let me tell you a story A few years back I heard about a rapper named IceT who was selling a CD called Cop Killer celebrating ambushing and murdering police officers It was being marketed by none other than TimeWarner the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world Police across the country were outraged Rightfully soat least one had been murdered But TimeWarner was stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them and the media were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black I heard TimeWarner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly Hills I owned some shares at the time so I decided to attend What I did there was against the advice of my family and colleagues I asked for the floor To a hushed room of a thousand average American stockholders I simply read the full lyrics of Cop Killerevery vicious vulgar instructional word I GOT MY GAUGE SAWED OFF I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF Im ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF Im ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF It got worse a lot worse I wont read the rest of it to you But trust me the room was a sea of shocked frozen blanched faces The TimeWarner executives squirmed in their chairs and stared at their shoes They hated me for that Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist filth where IceT fantasizes about sodomizing two year old nieces of Al and Tipper Gore SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY Well I wont do to you here what I did to them Lets just say I left the room in echoing silence When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps one of them said We cant print that I know I replied but TimeWarner s selling it Two months later TimeWarner terminated IceTs contract Ill never be offered another film by Warners or get a good review from Time magazine But disobedience means you must be willing to act not just talk When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself jam the switchboard of the district attorneys office When your university is pressured to lower standards until percent of the students graduate with honors choke the halls of the board of regents When an yearold boy pecks a girls cheek on the playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment march on that school and block its doorways When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays you petition them oust them banish them When Time magazines cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged crazy Christians holding a cross as it did last month boycott their magazine and the products it advertises So that this nation may long endure I urge you to follow in the hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that freed exiles founded religions defeated tyrants and yes in the hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men by Gods grace built this country If Dr King were here I think he would agree Thank you atthtm

Arensberg Gene Adams George Sent Monday November AM Subject Fw What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Original Message From Concerned Jeffrey Anderson To Sent Friday November AM Subject What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Are we having fun embarrassing our Nation Mr Gore What do you hope to prove cry baby Its getting nasty What to Do if Gore Wont Concede After a Bush Victory Al Gores campaign chairman William Daley has indicated that if the recount shows a Bush victory Gore will not concede Daley together with Warren Christopher have suggested that they will take the situation to the courts In case the Democrats refuse to relinquish power here is a suggested course of action United Republican Fund of Illinois Chicago November From Joseph A Morris President To URF Leaders and Friends Herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the Florida recount confirms the election of George Bush but Al Gore fails to concede We all know what is going on in Florida and that the election hinges on the outcome I am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what I think is going to happen actually does The recount which will be finished by pm Thursday will likely show Bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted Those ballots will be overwhelmingly for Bush a minimum of and probably closer to If the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election This is when something critical happens Either Gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and I can almost guarantee he wont These are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming They will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election In when Richard Nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country Expect no such noble behavior this time What will they try One bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the Florida results on a flimsy premise They are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in Palm Beach County I have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least Indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in Chicago and Cook County Illinois in this very election What is more it is just as likely that Palm Beach County voters who wanted to vote for Bush inadvertently voted for Nader All parties approved the form of ballot before the election The formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the Florida election While I hope this scenario doesnt come to pass I fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country The election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court If this comes to pass the vision of our Founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed Personally I am not going to stand for this and I hope you wont either The good news is that we are not without voice HERE IS WHAT MUST BE DONE if the vote count affirms Bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the Gore camp If they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials AT EVERY LEVEL with phone calls of outrage that demand Gores concession I mean literally millions of phone calls We must jam their phone banks with callsThere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult While youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well If it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that Gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for Gore to withstand the pressure He will have to relent Here are some places to start The White House telephone FAX email The Vice Presidents Office telephone FAX email Vice Presidents Senate Office telephone Senator Tom Daschle Senate Democratic Leader Also Representative Dick Gephardt House Democratic Leader Also Also be sure to call your congressmen and both your senators All these numbers are easily located on votercom You can also contact them through the US Capitol Switchboard US Capitol Switchboard all Senators and Representatives Another office to call is that of Chicagos Mayor Richard M Daley the brother of Gores campaign manager Bill Daley Telephone FAX If youve never made a call like this theres no reason to be shy They get opinion calls all the time and are set up to take them In fact they like calls It helps them tell which way the wind is blowing Im hoping none of this will be necessary but I fear otherwise As Edmund Burke said the price of freedom is eternal vigilance This email is just to prepare you for the battle that we must engage PLEASE FORWARD THIS EMAIL MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU CAN THINK OF IF WE HARNESS THE POWER OF THE INTERNET BY TOMORROW MILLIONS OF US WILL BE READY s MORRIS Human Events Respond to this
