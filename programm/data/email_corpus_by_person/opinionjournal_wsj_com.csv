just one exampleinvariably refer to Clark as a civil rights advocate He is nothing of the sort As we documented last October bestidramsey Clark is the founder of something called the International Acition Center a farleft outfit that makes common cause with just about every one of Americas enemies none of which as it happens have much respect for civil rights Clark should be described as an antiAmerican advocate not a civil rights advocate The former may sound harsh but the latter is a lie Guardian Angels homestoryhtmlfstorieshtml Remember last week bestidhrw when the sob sisters at Human Rights Watch were complaining that shaving terrorist prisoners to prevent head lice was an affront to Islam Canadas National Post reports that the Taliban and alQaeda prisoners held at the US

moviesblackhawkdown on the grounds that it depicts Somalis as savages CNN reports that a bootleg copy of the movie was screened in the Somali capital of Mogadishu and the Somalis in the audience acted like well savages QUOTE Audience members seemed to take delight in scenes of US defeat Each time an American chopper went down in the film the audience cheered Every time an American serviceman was killed the audience cheered some more END QUOTE Some of the Somali filmgoers didnt agree with the SomaliAmerican complaints As you can see Somalis are brave fighters one man told CNN If the Americans come back to fight us we shall defeat them again The Bush Black Sheep ArticleaspID Jimmy Carter had brother Billy Ronald Reagan had Patti and the balletdancing son Bill Clinton had brother Roger and brothersinlaw Hugh and Tony With a Bush back in the White House it seemed wed be spared the embarrassing presidential relationsand for the first year we were We dont count Jenna and Barbaras tippling troubles as an embarrassment trying a drink is a perfectly wholesome even if not strictly legal thing for a teenager to do Alas President Bushs brother Neil who you may dimly remember as a figure in a failed savingsandloan a decade or so ago has emerged to embarrass the man in the White House The Arab News reports Neil was in Saudi Arabia yesterday urging Arabs to undertake a sustained lobbying and PR effort to counter the US media campaign against the interests of Arabs and Muslims Neil also identified himself as part of the rootcause crowd There could be economic disparities social unrest or unemployment causing growing dissatisfaction in the region But I have been told that the bigger issue is the resolving of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict Oh brother If Only We Had Ways of Making Him Not Talk cgibinarticlecgifcaEDDTL Alan Dershowitz has been urging the legalization of torture as a means of extracting information from terror suspects In a San Francisco Chronicle oped he says judges should be able to issue torture warrants QUOTE The suspect would be given immunity from prosecution based on information elicited by the torture The warrant would limit the torture to nonlethal means such as sterile needles being inserted beneath the nails to cause excruciating pain without endangering life END QUOTE Some people have expressed surprise that this generally liberal law prof should be endorsing such a plan But any of us whove endured a Dershowitz TV appearance know that he not only approves of torture hes quite good at inflicting it himself Rappers for America artsstoryhtml Londons Guardian reports that rap musiconce a genre whose politics consisted mostly of violent opposition to authorityhas become patriotic in the wake of Sept Earlys rapper MC Hammer once favored bland apolitical lyrics but no more QUOTE A former marine Hammer poses in front of the stars and stripes on the cover of his comeback album Active Duty and has been popping up on US television to fly the proverbial flag in his new and bogus role of unofficial spokesperson for hiphop Marxist duo the Coup have not been so fortunate Since hitting the headlines last September when they had to withdraw unintentionally prophetic album artwork depicting the twin towers exploding they have become the music industrys loudest dissenters They announced that anybody wearing the flag which they described as violent gang colours would not be admitted to their shows Predictably they have not had quite as many invitations to appear on TV as Hammer and they recently accused magazines such as Rolling Stone of diluting their statements to make them more palatable Crucially though the Coup and the handful of other antiwar rappers sell relatively little and to a predominately white liberal fanbase a subgenre known as backpacker hiphop END QUOTE Groundhog Day The Remake articlehtml In an interview with the Times of London film director Robert Altman sounds off on politics QUOTE This present government in America I just find disgusting the idea that George Bush could run a baseball team successfullyhe cant even speak I just find him an embarrassment I was over here when the election was on and I couldnt believe itand Im years old Then when the Supreme Court came in and turned out to be a totally political animal the last shred of any naivety that was left in me has gone When I see an American flag flying its a joke END QUOTE Altman adds If you asked would I live in London the rest of my life yeah Id be very happy to stay here Theres nothing in America that I would miss at all Hmm havent we heard this before peoplefeaturestarexileindexhtml Stupidity Watch Ah what a bountiful harvest of imbecility we have today First off is Sandy Tolan newscommentncguesthtm an independent journalist and radio documentary producer who penned a USA Today column denouncing the media for being too patriotic Shes critical of journalists who think the Pentagon would tell the truth but shes all for dubious sourcesas long as theyre antiAmerican QUOTE Take the case of civilian deaths from the bombings in Afghanistan A careful reading of American newspapers finds repeated instances in which dozens even hundreds of civilians have been killed by US bombs A University of New Hampshire professor culling reports from the front estimates the total death toll at more than If true this exceeds the number killed here on Sept Yet the stories coming from Afghanistan are largely of liberation and chaotic joy The bombings are often covered as collateral damage that happens in war Other times Pentagon denials coming out of Washington are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from antiTaliban villagers on the ground the story dissolves into a false balance of hesaid shesaid Unlike in Europe the US press rarely focuses on the growing rage over bombs falling on civilians Its as if such rage doesnt exist But how else do we explain that in early December the British journalist Robert Fisk was nearly beaten to death by bombedout Afghan refugees just inside the Pakistani border Their fury led Fisk to conclude in a courageous piece filed shortly after escaping with his life that had he been in their position I would have done just what they did I would have attacked Robert Fisk Or any other Westerner I could find END QUOTE The New Hampshire study storiesciviliandeathshtm she cites is pure junk science it bases its conclusions on such sources of information as the proIslamist alJazeera news network In any case even honest efforts to count large numbers of casualties are difficult remember when people had died at the World Trade Center As for Fisk she accepts at face value this notoriously antiAmerican writers ideologically selfserving interpretation of his beating which as we noted bestidfisk sounded to us like a simple robbery attempt Speaking of Robert Fisk commentatorsstoryjspstory heres a whopper from his latest column in the Independent QUOTE Minus the torture the United States is now doing what most Arab regimes have been doing for decades arresting their brutal Islamist enemies holding them incommunicado chained and hooded while preparing unfair trials END QUOTE Yeah well minus the brains this Fisk is a regular Einstein isnt he In Londons Evening Standard AN Wilson dynamicnewstopstoryhtmlinreviewidinreviewtextid weighs in with what starts out as a rant against the inhumane treatment of the Gitmo prisoners and turns into a rant against anything and everything American QUOTE These stories and pictures horrify us but they should not surprise us The Bush administration and its European defenders are not concerned to spread abroad Christianity or the enlightenment virtues of the American founding fathers They are not Jeffersons or Benjamin Franklins concerned with liberty or human dignity They are the most merciless exponents of world capitalism with the determination to have a McDonalds and a Starbucks with all that this globalised economy implies in every country on earth They are the forces of Big Money not the representatives of Good Ol Uncle Sam END QUOTE The neweconomy mag Fast Company features an interview with William Ian Miller onlinecouragehtml author of a book on courage Only neither Miller nor interviewer Harriet Rubin seems to have a clue as to what courage is If I had a wish says Miller it would be never to be scared never to feel the shame of being scared In truth courage consists not in the absence of fearfear in the face of danger is a natural and healthy instinctbut in the overcoming of fear It turns out though that Miller has a political agenda QUOTE Its terrible how little courage our leaders have Rudy Giuliani did the right thing on September He stood out like a sore thumb Where was the president He was in Nebraskaand his people were putting out false reports that he was under threat Giuliani manifested courage He put his body on the line even though he could have been killed in the collapse of WTC Tower Tony Blair is doing more to deal with terrorism than our own president END QUOTE Well cheers for Rudy and Tony but its ridiculous to downplay the efforts of President Bush who is unquestionably the leader of the war Moreover Miller seems unaware that Air Force One went to Nebraska at the urging of the Secret Service and it was Bush who insisted on returning to Washington on the night of Sept Cartoon Nation habctsobesityblamehtml The Simpsons indexhtml has had a brilliant run more than a dozen years but were ready to predict that it will end within a season or two The problem is real life has become so ridiculous its hard for a cartoon to be any funnier A case in point This past Sunday The Simpsons aired a new episode in which Marge shocked to learn that Springfield is the fattest town in America hires a lawyer to sue big sugar Two days later that is to say today ABC had a similar storybut this was an ABC habctsobesityblamehtml News habctsobesityblamehtml story QUOTE There is a movement afoot to do something about the obesity problem not just as a visual blight but to see it in terms of costs says John Banzhaf a George Washington University Law School professor Most public health experts agree that regulations or taxes would be better than legal action but they are mindful that after years of going after Big Tobacco antismoking forces only achieved success when plaintiffs and lawyers stepped in END QUOTE Weve had lawsuits against the tobacco industry and the gun industry and it looks like the food industry is going to be next What other ridiculous causes can the plaintiffs lawyers take up If you have a suggestion write us at mailto If its witty enough well use itand who knows maybe well come up with enough ideas to save The Simpsons Homelessness Rediscovery Watch QUOTE If George W Bush becomes president the armies of the homeless hundreds of thousands strong will once again be used to illustrate the oppositions arguments about welfare the economy and taxation Mark Helprin columnistsmhelprinid Oct Homelessness Rising in Hawaii Safety nets designed to help needy families buckle under the strain of isle economic woesheadline and subheadline Honolulu StarBulletin newsstoryhtml Jan END QUOTE Peoples Republic of Massachusetts dailyglobemetroForsomeawordweighsheavilyshtml Bostons Mayor Thomas Menino has vetoed a measure passed by the City Council that would ban the word minority in all city business The vote was unanimous as presumably all votes will have to be if the council overrides the veto since a nonunanimous measure would pass over the objections of a youknowwhat Hmm votes were always unanimous in communist countries too Now we know why they call it the Peoples Republic of Massachusetts The Boston Globe adds QUOTE As Boston steps into the forefront of a growing debate over whether the word has the outdated ring of Negro Oriental Spanish and Eskimo theres discord over which replacement term to use END QUOTE Spanish is outdated So what do Bostonians call a visitor from Madrid Global Warming on the Rocks habctsicehtml The globalwarming industry is desperately trying to spin itself out of the revelation that temperatures in Antarctica have actually been getting lower ABC News quotes geologist Ian Joughin as saying Theres no question that some parts of Antarctica are warming But it could be this part of the ice sheet is not necessarily sensitive to global warming If this is true scientists ought to be studying that ice to find out just what makes it insensitive to global warming This could have profound technological consequences At the very least heatresistant ice would be a great boon to those of us who like to sip our scotch on the rocks

Rag or RightWing Gag On Friday acting on a tip from reader Gregory Brunt we noted that The Nation had published an article on its Web site by Matt Bivens bestidmatt the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error QUOTE When George W Bush coowned the Houston Astros and construction began on a new stadium Kenneth Lay agreed to spend million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron END QUOTE Bush of course was partowner of the Texas Rangers not the Astros Almost immediately after we published Fridays column The Nation fixed the error Or at least it tried As The Weekly Standard ContentPublicArticlesgwezkasp notes heres how the modified sentence read QUOTE When George W Bush coowned the Texas Rangers and construction began on a new stadium Kenneth Lay agreed to spend million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron END QUOTE Alas for The Nation this was no more accurate Enron Field baseballnationalbpkaushtm is where the Astros play the Rangers home is the Ballpark in Arlington baseballamericanbpkarlhtm which has no corporate sponsor Bivens also screwed up the chronology Bush sold his interest in the Rangers in Enron bought naming rights to the Astros new stadium in So an accurate version of Bivenss lead would have read QUOTE A year after George W Bush sold his interest in the Texas Rangers construction began on a new stadium for the Houston Astros and Kenneth Lay agreed to spend million over thirty years for rights to name the latter teams park after Enron END QUOTE That of course does not reflect badlyor indeed in any way at allon President Bush though the incident reflects terribly on the bushleague journalism they practice at The Nation Apparently the magazines editors agree by Saturday afternoon the Bivens piece had disappeared from their Web site though the modified version cgibinhtsearchconfigrestrictexcludemethodandformatbuiltinlongsortscorewordshoustonastros still shows up in The Nations search engine We all make mistakes but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by Nation editors and writers that weve chronicled in recent months Katrina vanden Heuvel bestidkatrina editorinchief of this political magazine appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman Columnist Eric Alterman bestideric apparently borrowed a phrase from George Will in then years later accused Will of plagiarizing him Just two weeks after Sept columnist Katha Pollitt bestidkatha wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the American flag How could anyone be this dumb Well remember David Brock Back in the early s he was the star reporter for The American Spectator a conservative magazine He turned out to be a liberal saboteur and as erstwhile Spectatorian Byron York issuesyorkhtm reported recently in The Atlantic Monthly he ended up all but destroying the Spectator Is it possible that The Nation that venerable leftwing magazine has been infiltrated by rightwing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left Wed like to go on the record opposing this kind of deception If vanden Heuvel Alterman Pollitt et al really are rightwingers they should come clean and engage their ideological opponents in an honest debate This sort of deception is juvenile and contemptible and its especially inappropriate now After all theres a war on noted Thursday bestidkrugman a curious report in the New York Times that Times columnist Paul Krugman had once received for serving on an Enron advisory board Andrew Sullivan smells scandal But hes overreacting Based on what we know so far Krugmans conduct looks foolish but not unethical Sullivan has done a manful job of trying to come up with an ethical transgression unearthing an article Krugman wrote for Fortune Epkrugmanemanhtml while still on the Enron payroll in Its a puff piece on Enron and it stands in sharp contrast with Krugmans current views on the subject most notably his column of last Friday opinionKRUGhtml Times links require registration in which he rails against the company as a symbol of the corruption of American capitalism But whatever the merits of Krugmans views before or after the turn of the century he does seem to have complied with the rules of journalistic ethics He disclosed his relationship with Enron in the Fortune piece and again in a January Times column opinionKRUGhtml When he joined the Times as a columnist in he gave up the Enron gig as the Times conflictofinterest policy requires Sullivan thinks Krugman should also have disclosed the amount of his fee for being on an advisory board need not be a source of payment This seems an exceedingly picayune point especially for someone who styles himself the scourge of gotcha journalism trbhtml Does anyone serve on an advisory board for a forprofit company without compensation In any case Sullivans beef here ought to be not with Krugman but with his editors at Fortune and

suggests that the American campaign in Afghanistan is morally equivalent to the attack on the World Trade Center QUOTE It is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement It is not possible when the strategy appears confused and political leaders talk about a war that may last years And there is a fine line between for example the crippling of military and aircraft installations and the devastating of an infrastructure with a halfformed aim of destroying morale Combine that with the use of antipersonnel weapons such as cluster bombs which ought to raise some serious questions they have been described as aerial landmines in terms of their randomly lethal character and the whole enterprise is tainted Tainted because as soon as assaults on public morale by allowing random killing as a matter of calculated policy become part of a military strategy we are at once vulnerable to the charge that there is no moral difference in kind between our military action and the terror that it attacks END QUOTE Williams is not so much turning the other cheek as being twofaced He tells the Telegraph newsmainjhtmlxmlnewsnarchxml that he didnt really mean that America is guilty of terrorism QUOTE The yearold Primate of Wales agreed that terrorism was an evil that had to be rooted out but said I dont think you root out terrorism by reproducing its methods And thats always the danger if we respond in some ways hastily I didnt say that the American campaign was morally equivalent to terrorism just that there were certain possible tactics in that campaign which would leave them open to that charge END QUOTE Williams also writes in a passage quoted by the

from the corrupt and repressive kingdom The Posts report contains three quotes from the peripatetic past prez QUOTE There are not so many US military people here as to constitute a sort of occupation

systems within every fouryear period to review other things Look at our forces in Asia and even in Latin America It is a function of what we might be asked to do and being able to do it by having some

<29552270.1075840331858.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,opinionjournal@wsj.com,2002-01-17 14:22:54,OpinionJournal Best of the Web Today January PST From Best of the Web Today January By JAMES TARANTO Bob Herberts Flaming Pajamas opinionHERBhtml New York Times columnist Bob Herbert link requires registration continues to fan the smoldering wreckage of Enron in hopes of igniting a political scandal Last week as we noted bestidenron he unsuccessfully tried to suggest that Enron had purchased influence from the Bush administration Now in a column taking aim at Sen Phil Gramm and his wife Wendy he has discovered a new problem QUOTE That problem is the obsession with deregulation that has had such a hold on the Republican Party and corporate America Whos left to look out for the small fry If the deregulation zealots had their way wed be left with tainted food unsafe cars bridges collapsing into rivers childrens pajamas bursting into flames and a host of corporations far more rapacious and unscrupulous than they are now END QUOTE Herbert asserts though he fails to demonstrate that deregulation sought by Enron and instituted by Republican zealots led to the companys downfall Even if he were right this would amount to a pretty convincing case there theres no political scandal here Herbert is accusing Republicans merely of supporting policies with which he disagrees Theres nothing corrupt about that In any case todays Bob Novak columnistsrobertnovakrnshtml column gives the lie to Herberts simpleminded view QUOTE Enron CEO Ken Lay has been painted as a heartless advocate of free market economics when he actually was working behind the scenes for control of energy emissions establishing alliances with the most radical environmentalist pressure groups Just as Enron pushed electrical deregulation to make billions in energy trades Lay wanted restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto agreement to artificially create a market for CO credits to be purchased to burn coal Enron was not about ideology and certainly not partisanship but was using governmental contacts to maximize profits END QUOTE Novak reports that Lay enlisted former senator Tim Wirth a Colorado Democrat to lobby Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill in favor of the Kyoto treatyanother example of the ineffectiveness of Enrons efforts to purchase influence in the Bush administration Theres nothing particularly unusual about a company favoring regulation a business enterprise is by definition not about ideology but about making a profit Regulations often create business opportunities as Kyoto would have for Enron or act as a barrier to entry for potential competitors since a big established company is more easily able to absorb the costs of regulation than a small upstart Herbert seems to understand none of this His comicbook view of the worldin which whitehatted government regulators look out for small fry and battle evil corporate predators who hate all regulationis so childlike we cant help but hope his pajamas dont burst into flames amid his heated rhetoric We Dont Need No Education businessBUSHhtml The Times also reports link requires registration that Democrats are complaining of a significant conflict of interest in the words of one Dem consultant because White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey who received a consulting fee from Enron before joining the administration conducted a study for the White House beginning in midOctober on the effects of a prospective Enron collapse on the overall economy The most amusing part of this story though is the final two paragraphs QUOTE Paul Krugman an editorial columnist for The New York Times said he was also paid to serve on an Enron advisory board in He disclosed his connection in a Jan column opinionKRUGhtml about Enron This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of Mr Krugman said today My later interpretation is that it was all part of the way they built an image All in all I was just another brick in the wall END QUOTE Krugman who is also an economics professor at a university in or near Texas bestidkrugman quit his Enron gig when he joined the Times The New Generation Gap TampaBayStudentssupportAlAshtml The University of South Florida recently fired Sami AlArian a tenured Palestinian Arab computerscience professor who has become notorious for antiIsrael comments and who has been investigated for though never charged with links to terror organizations Last week the statewide faculty union FloridaMetroMGAEUJDKBWChtml followed suit early this week USF students however see things differently The USF student senate voted unanimously to support the firing The St Petersburg Times reports QUOTE They said they want people to stop calling their school Terrorism University Jihad U and the University of Suicidal Fanatics What does this say about our school said student Kaylin Grey who is applying for law school When I graduate I want my degree to mean something END QUOTE Theres something to be said for the proAlArian position repugnant though his views on the Middle East are Professors shouldnt be fired for their political opinions if they were faculties would be even more uniformly leftliberal than they are today But the studentfaculty split at USF is fascinating College students have been fighting political correctness on campus for well over a decade but usually alone or in small groups with outside support from conservative organizations and sometimes the ACLU With war reminding young people of the importance of patriotism and national unity we may be seeing the first stirrings of a nationwide antiPC revolt Saudi Sob Stories newsnationworldworldlajanstory Austrians as reader SE Brenner points out sometimes make the risible and rather offensive claim that they were the Nazis first victims Now the Saudis are up to something similar Todays Los Angeles Times carries a dispatch from Riyadh entitled Saudis Feel Unfairly Tarred With a Terrorist Brush It quotes Saudis who dont believe that Saudi native Osama bin Laden was behind the attacks and who accuse the US of failing to provide proof that of the Sept hijackers were Saudi citizens And just in case the Nazi analogy seems strained the Times also quotes Saudis who blame the Jews for everything All Saudis like Americans said Abdelaziz a businessman who requested that his full name not be used But as Arabs we do not like the American government We believe it is controlled by the Zionists The government works to destroy the Arabs Is it true I dont know it is what we believe USA Today newscommentncguesthtm meanwhile lets a Saudi national and US resident named Sulaiman AlHattlan take nearly words to sound off on his nightmare flying from Riyadh back to Boston by way of Geneva and Frankfurt Heres a sample QUOTE I even imagined how humiliated I would be if the FBI arrested me at the airport and I hoped if that happened my seatmates from the flight wouldnt see me being escorted by FBI agents The worst part of this nightmare was that I had to convince myself that the FBI has the right to suspect that someone like me could be linked to terrorism Consider the identifying characteristics of the suspected hijackers of the four American airplanes on Sept Some of them looked just like me and worst of all several came from my province in the southwest of Saudi Arabia On my Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Boston I sat very quietly reading the Financial Times wondering whether reading the Times might cause suspicion I made sure not to look around or try to use the bathroom My usual excitement on airplanes was gone I did not immediately talk to the passengers next to me nor did I dare ask the flight attendant for a glass of water Soon enough I slept or pretended to sleep Though I always try to be polite this time I felt I was trying too hard and smiling too much Would that make someone think I am a terrorist All of a sudden I asked myself why I should have to fear others and myself when I am fully certain that I have nothing to do with terrorism except my terror of terrorism itself I had failed to realize that I am too a victim of terrorism END QUOTE The entire article is about AlHattlans inner turmoil over the possibility that he might be embarrassed or humiliated by someone who takes him for a potential terrorist Theres not a word to suggest that anything of the sort actually happened Well gee Sulaiman flying is a little nerveracking for all of us these daysand there are scarier things that can happen on an airplane than being eyed suspiciously by fellow passengers or even being hauled off by the FBI Suck it up buddy Arafats Blood Libel groupiapinfomessage The Islamic Association for Palestine reports that Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yasser Arafat has accused the Israeli apartheid regime of murdering Palestinian children and youths and extricating their vital organs for organ transplants Arafat told

started on the upper floors was caused by a short circuit but were not ruling out other causes Too bad those Pakistani buildings arent built from the same material they use to make Bob Herberts

Afghanistan to the disputed Line of Control in Kashmir sharply reducing its ability to capture Taliban and al Qaeda troops fleeing Afghanistan Our Friends the Indians newsprinthtml Wiredcom reports

church volunteer in a Sacramento Calif bank robbery One of the alleged murderers is Kathleen Soliah a k a Sara Jane Olson who has already pleaded guilty in another terrorist attack The Los Angeles Times reports The timing of the arrests provoked questions coming just two days before Olsons sentencing on charges of planting a bomb under a Los Angeles police car in The bomb never exploded The paper doesnt say who asked the questions the timing provoked nor does it say just what the questions were The New York Times nationalARREhtml link requires registration reports that one of the defendants Bill Harris was asked in an interview last year how hed changed over the years Im older no longer selfdestructive and unwilling to go to jail he said We were a bunch of amateurs I wish everyone would forget us But Myrna Opsahl deserves justice even justice delayed just as Medgar Evers archivedecnaahtm did Back to NormalI wpdynarticlesAJanhtml The FBI is denying yesterdays New York Post report that it has taken over the investigation of Chandra Levys disappearance from the Washington DC police the Washington Post reports There has been nothing new a US attorneys office spokeswoman tells the Washington Post I have no idea what the impetus for that story was Maybe just an overeager effort on the tabloids part to get back to normal four months after Sept Back to NormalII newsnationalnewshtm At least the New York Post has Monica Lewinsky The tabloid reports she nearly broke down in front of reporters as she was promoting her new HBO documentary Monica in Black and White QUOTE Lewinsky stumbled through a series of polite questions but came unglued when asked about the crude jokes that have dogged her for four years Theres a difference between a pleasant joke and a personal joke Lewinsky told a gathering of TV critics The ones that take my last name and equate them to a sex act that a lot of people in the world do is a really cruel thing to do END QUOTE Those coy brackets by the way are the Posts Back to NormalIII nationalPASShtml At the New York Times links require registration theyre definitely getting back to normal Specifically theyve resumed their interwarera habit of running frequent and odd reports related to homosexualitythough with a Sept twist Todays Times has a feature on Mark Bingham one of the heroes of Flight Bingham a foot rugby player and PR man was gay and his story is an inspiring one as well as a withering rejoinder to Jerry Falwell who famously blamed homosexuals among others for the Sept atrocities The Times take on Bingham though is a peculiar one The headline says it all Passenger on Jet Gay Hero or Hero Who Was Gay Apparently in some circles this is an important distinction We first noticed the resumption of the Times gay coverage on Sunday when the paper ran a piece entitled Gay Muslims Face a Growing Challenge nyregionGAYhtml Hmm are they gay Muslims or Muslims who are gay Homelessness Rediscovery Watch QUOTE If George W Bush becomes president the armies of the homeless hundreds of thousands strong will once again be used to illustrate the oppositions arguments about welfare the economy and taxation

Hunger Homelessnessheadline Denver Post StoriesEhtml Jan Shelter From Coldand More Busier Facilities Cite Economy Limited Housingheadline and subheadline Washington Post wpdynarticlesAJanhtml Jan END QUOTE Not as Hungry as We Thought docodaykerkorianshtml Because of an error in the Reuters story we linked to yesterdays item on Lisa Kirkorians childsupport request overstated the amount she was seeking for food by an order of magnitude The correct sum is a month for food at home and household supplies and for eating outnot The Smoking Gun has the actual document itemizing Kirkorians account of threeyearold Kiras monthly expenses Among them is for telephone Assuming of that goes for local service and Kira has a centaminute longdistance plan this threeyearold is spending roughly hours a day on the phone Mrs Kirkorian also requests for car lease payments including license and registration fees Kira apparently has two BMWs She must need a backup in case of an accidentwhich is pretty likely when a threeyearold is driving Revenge of the Nerds We heard from yearold John Guth who along with his sidekick Jeff Tweiten plans to wait in line for days until the release of the new Star Wars movie We noted the story last week bestidgeek Guth writes QUOTE It never ceases to amaze me how so many people make comments like What a tragic waste One hundred thirtyfive days is almost enough time to get a life based out of pure ignorance but the Wall Street Journal Wow Not sure which reporter over there made this comment but they obviously need some lessons on reporting facts not fiction I thought reporters were supposed to get both sides of the story but I guess the WSJ doesnt follow that journalistic policy FYIif you consider giving thousands of dollars to children in orphanages a tragic waste of time I feel for you When this is all done with we anticipate over to be raised for the needy kids in the Seattle area Obviously whoever made such an ignorant comment works for a

Be Charged LAWretwalkerchargesindexhtml Marin mujahid John Walker will be charged with aiding and abetting terrorism The Justice Department plans a press conference to discuss the matter around pm EST It was not clear whether he would face other federal charges CNN reports Pretzel Logic hapbsenronhandsoffhtml As we noted yesterday bestid Democrats who are desperately seeking to spin the Enron fiasco into a political scandal have been having trouble agreeing on just what would constitute a scandal Some think it would be a scandal if Enrons political contributions to President Bush influenced his administrations decisions others think it would be a scandal if the administration refused to help the company in its hour of need Now the Associated Press reports a selfproclaimed ethics watchdog has managed to twist the two contradictory scenarios into one QUOTE Because of Enrons heavy donations to President Bushs campaigns administration officials were tied at the hip to Enron said Bill Allison an official of the private Center for Public Integrity That made it hard to help The appearance would have looked terrible Allison said They felt that they couldnt act on behalf of Enron because of the political fallout END QUOTE Allison seems to be complaining that Enrons campaign contributions did influence the administrationby making it impossible for it to help without creating the appearance of a conflict of interest But wait Havent selfproclaimed ethics watchdogs been telling us for decades that its a public officials duty to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest Besides theres no actual evidence that the administration ignored Enrons entreaties for any reason other than the merits All we have is the appearance of an attempt to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest We doubt this pretzel is going to choke President Bush The Nativists Are Restless fulfordbusharabhtm One heartening feature of the postSept political landscape has been the absence of a generalized backlash against immigrants Youd think a horrific sneak attack by foreigners on American soil would be a perfect opportunity for the closetheborders crowd but theyve scarcely been heard from Of course their argument wouldnt really stand up its preposterous on its face to suggest that Mexican gardeners are a nationalsecurity threat even if Arab flight students are It also may be that the antiimmigrant folks are getting ignored because they have a tendency to be cranks Evidence of the latter hypothesis can be found on Peter Brimelows Web site VDarecom which features an article by James Fulford on Walied Shater the ArabAmerican Secret Service man who is threatening to make a federal case out of his runin with an American Airlines pilot We have criticized Shaters behavior but Fulford objects to his ethnicity QUOTE My question is one that no one seems to have asked Why does W have an Arab bodyguard anyway Anwar Sadat was assassinated by his own troops Bin Laden and friends have been linked to that incident But Sadat didnt have any choice about being guarded by Arabs Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard She did have a choice about being guarded by Sikhs rather than Hindus at a time when her troops were engaged in clearing Sikh terrorists out of the Sikh temple In bulletriddled retrospect her choice was wrong President Bush seems to be irate that his bodyguard couldnt get on the plane What makes me upseteven madder than heckis that Bush who is involved in a War on Arab Terrorism is so politically correct that he apparently sees nothing wrong with being guarded by a man who may decide on principle to kill him END QUOTE This is utterly cracked Shater is no traitor no one has accused him of being anything worse than a jackass Unless all the news accounts are wrong he is not an Arab national but an American of Arab descent If Fulford had been around in would he have complained that the supreme allied commander in Europe was a German Intelligence at Sea nationalhtm US intelligence agencies helped Israel track down a Palestinian ship that tried to smuggle a large supply of weapons obtained from Iran The Washignton Times Bill Gertz reports US intelligence agencies using various hightech intelligencegathering means were able to identify the Karine A after it loaded the weapons near Irans Kish Island some miles north of the major Iranian naval port of Bandar Abbas Hmm maybe they could brief Colin Powell bestidexplain and explain just what the ship was up to Osama at Sea sectionsworldDailyNewsescapehtml Theres another ship they may want to keep an eye out for ABC News reports that an intelligence analysis sent to the CIA director last week concluded Osama bin Laden has escaped American efforts to find him in Afghanistan and that he most likely has fled the entire region by sea Roundup in Pakistan internationalasiaSTANhtml Pakistan has rounded up people across the country in recent days and sealed offices of militant groups as part of a widening crackdown on extremists ordered by Gen Pervez Musharraf For the first time Kashmirbased militants are among those arrested Indian officials remain skeptical Defense Minister George Fernandes say in the Times words that his country remained poised for war if Pakistan did not act quickly enough Hide Your Women jankurtzshtml In National Review Stanley Kurtz defends the traditional Muslim practice of covering women QUOTE The veil as body bag notion is both mistaken and dangerous There is no surer way to drive the Islamic world into the arms of the fundamentalists than to force Western feminism on a newly conquered Muslim country It is no coincidence that the two Muslim fundamentalist regimes of our dayIran and Afghanistanarose in nations that had systematically attempted to root out traditional Islamic practices regarding women Those efforts were sponsored by the shah in Iran and the Soviets in Afghanistan Instead of being damned as a senseless outrage veiling deserves a qualified defense The practice has undoubtedly slowed the Muslim worlds path to modernity and that is a serious problem But that difficulty would never have arisen in the first place if veiling hadnt accomplished something important Veiling is embraced by millions of Muslim men and women as one of the keys to their way of life They are not mistaken END QUOTE Well maybe On the other hand the Turkish government is so opposed to traditional Muslim practices that women arent even allowed to wear headscarves in many public facilities yet theres no danger of a fundamentalist regime arising in Ankara Besides surely theres a happy medium between the Taliban and The Vagina Monologues Why not just let women themselves

Hetheringtons study either or depending on whether you believe the article text or the sidebar have serious social emotional or psychological problems whereas only of children in intact families do That is to say if youre divorced your kids are at least twice as likely to be seriously screwedup as if youre still married to their other parent Incredibly though Hetherington tries to pass this finding off as if it led to the exact opposite conclusion As USA Today reporter Karen S Peterson unskeptically describes it The negative impact of divorce on both children and parents has been exaggerated and only about onefifth of youngsters experience any longterm damage after their parents break up Hetherington protests that shes not prodivorce but its hard to see what purpose her pollyannish interpretation of her data can serve other than to ease whatever guilt and stigma are still associated with divorce To be sure divorce is sometimes a necessary evil It would be cruel and unreasonable to demand that anyone stay with an abusive or unfaithful spouse But consider a case in which one spouse wants a divorce out of mere boredom or frustration The spouse who doesnt want a divorce has a powerful rejoinder We should stay together for the sake of the children Its all the more persuasive in light of Hetheringtons finding that divorce more than doubles the likelihood that

extreme critics like the Wall Street Journal really pine for the days when there were few or no blacks at Harvard when the undergraduates were largely stamped from the same upperclass and middleclass mold Thats the way it was when I was an undergraduate Believe me it is much better now The students are far smarter and far more interesting There are lots from outside the United States and quite a few with skin tones other than pink I doubt that you Stuart would want to go back to the old days END QUOTE The editorial from which Lewis draws this conclusion is in fact a rousing endorsement of diversity It praises Summers for an inaugural speech that embraced with great warmth the principle of inclusiveness in its description of Harvard as a place where men and women of all faiths races and classes were welcome that addressed with passion the importance of equal opportunity and that made clear that able students should be welcome to all the universitys professional schools regardless of their financial circumstances It criticizes only the use of affirmative actionthat is selective lowering of standards based on race or ethnicityas a means of promoting diversity How does Lewis come up with such a tendentious interpretation Well consider the era in which he came of age He graduated form Harvard in six years before Brown v Board of Education years before the Civil Rights Act the year Strom Thurmond ran for president as a segregationist candidate and years before George Wallaces similar thirdparty campaign When Lewis was a freshly minted Harvard graduate and for at least two decades thereafter it was true that many people who rejected the liberal view of racial matters did so for invidious reasons But the world has changed since Elite opinion is now unanimous and popular opinion nearly so that black Americans are entitled to equality Todays racial conservatism holds that the government and other institutions should be colorblinda liberal view by standards Todays liberalism holds that remedial measures are necessary to compensate for past injustices Thats a defensible view but one that should be defended on its own merits Instead people like Lewis invoke a moral authority that began to become obsolete sometime around Todays racial liberalism they claim is the legacy of yesteryears and those who oppose affirmative action are really segregationists at heart Aside from being dishonest and divisive this approach promotes a view of black Americans that is patronizing at best Its telling that Lewis while praising the genuine scholars in Harvards AfroAmerican studies departmentAnthony Appiah Henry Louis Gates and William Julius Wilsondemurs from expressing an opinion about West saying only that he is an original and I do not want to get into the war over his work and that Summerss criticism of him was politically illadvised Such delicacy toward West is striking by contrast with Lewiss smug denunciation of the Journals editors Plagiarism

at the Saudi National Guard headquarters in Riyadh killed several American military advisers who worked closely with the force One source a former senior Clinton administration official said that the two princes whose names have not been disclosed began making payments to bin Laden soon after the bombing The official added that Washington did not learn of the payments until at least two years

raised some eyebrows by using the term Pakis It is considered an ethnic slur in Britain which has a large Pakistani immigrant population Well whose eyebrows exactly did Bush raise The Times doesnt say A clue however can be found in this Reuters dispatch QUOTE Asad Hayauddin spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington said he did not consider what Bush said to be an insult I would give him the benefit of the doubt and say it was said in passing In all fairness I would say its not a racial slur he said He did however receive a number of phone calls from reporters seeking the embassys

cartoon view of the world there is nothing worse than American powernot the womanenslaving Taliban not an unrepentant Al Qaeda committed to killing civilians as they pleaseand America is nothing but a selfseeking bully It does not face genuine dilemmas It never has legitimate reason to do what it does When its rulers views command popularity this can only be because the entire population has been brainwashed or rendered moronic or shares in its leaders monstrous values Generals its said are always planning to fight the last war But theyre not alone in suffering from sentimentality blindness and mental laziness disguised as resolve The oneeyed left helps no one when it mires itself in its own mirrorimage myths Breaking habits is desperately hard but those who evade the difficulties in

find a morning news anchor whos provocative supersmart and oh yeah just a little sexy Yesterday CNN executives yanked the ad It was a major blunder by our promotions department said CNN chairman Walter Isaacson Whats weird about this story is that the controversial part of the ad was the one claim that is indisputably accuratethat Zahn is just a little sexy The real outrage is that CNN would try to peddle her as supersmart This is after all the same Paula Zahn who in her Fox News Channel days managed to make a mockery of the Gary Condit story by credulously presenting a parade of psychics

intelligence committee said he was aware of a Saudi offer to help although under rules protecting classified information he was unable to discuss the details of any offer Commenting generally he said I dont believe that the fight against terrorism was the number one goal of the Clinton administration I believe there were some lost opportunities END QUOTE The Times also reports that according to a

says she is struggling to make ends meet living off donations from the mosque and welfare Her children miss their father whom they call Bubba they cry for no reason and cling to her But she is defiant Like many true believers she wont accept that bin Laden ordered the September attacks She suspects they were plotted by the CIA or Israeli intelligence She is opposed to killing civilians but if the jihad against the enemies and corrupters of Islam goes on and her yearold son wants to fight then shed consider letting him join when he comes of age She says she puts her faith in the will of Allah As Muslims we accept death she says We know its part of life But just in case she says she wants to buy a gun END QUOTE About bin Laden Ray says He was a great boss Hes not the monster people make him

Timothy Noah notes that the Associated Press has issued a correction of a weeksold dispatchwhich we noted way back on Dec bestidhottub that wrongly reported Marcie Miller principal of Marin mujahid John Walkers high school said she was proud of Walker Noah quotes from the correction QUOTE The only thing Miller initially had to say about Lindhwho attended Tamiscal High School for a year and a half before taking an equivalency exam and leaving at the age of was that teachers had called him a gifted writer of poetry I never met John so I never would have said that I am proud of him she said In fact Lindhs decision to volunteer for Osama bin Ladens cause is opposed to everything Ive devoted my life to Miller said My brother is a Gulf War hero I come from an extremely patriotic family my fathers a veteran and I find this appalling that Im being cast as a villain whos proud of anything John Walker Lindh has done since he left our school in January of Miller said the last time she made headlines was when she brought a junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program into another alternative school and was criticized for being an archconservative END QUOTE The guys at Salon newsfeatureapcorrectionindexnphtmlx actually had this story before Noah did but they didnt make the article available to their approximately six billion nonsubscribers Guess they didnt want to embarrass the AP Stupidity Watch veganvoicesingerhtml Is there intelligent life in solar system Vega Apparently not to judge by this letter to the Vegan Voice by one Karen Davis president of something called United Poultry Concerns QUOTE While I would not dream of using arguments to diminish the horror of the September attack for thousands of people I would also suggest that the people who died in the attack did not suffer more terrible deaths than animals in slaughterhouses suffer every day Moreover the survivors of the September attack and their loved ones have an array of consolationspatriotism the satisfaction of US retaliation religious faith TV ads calling them heroes etcthat the chickens whose lives are continuously painful and miserable including being condemned to live in humanimposed circumstances that are inimical and alien to them as chickens do not have available They suffer raw without the palliatives Doubtless the majority if not every single one of the people who suffered andor died as a result of the September attack ate and if they are now alive continue to eat chickens In conclusion I think it is speciesist to think that the September attack on the World Trade Center was a greater tragedy than what millions of chickens endured that day and what they endure every day because they cannot defend themselves against the concerted human appetites arrayed against them END QUOTE Somehow after reading this weve got a hankering for some McNuggets The Straight Dope id Remember when President Bush was dumb Until Sept it was the most tiresome cliche going but since then in light of his excellent performance as a war leader weve heard it from only the sourest of Americahaters Until now Slates Jacob Weisberg has made a manful effort to revive the Bushisstupid cliche and reconcile it with the presidents outstanding performance In brief Weisberg concocts an argument that Bush is a great wartime leader because hes not the sharpest knife in the drawer In wartime he writes certain qualities sometimes associated with high intelligencefascination with detail a tendency to selfreliance an awareness of ambiguitybecome greater obstacles to effective leadership Suffice it to say that we find this argument rather laboredso much so in fact that we couldnt help wondering if Weisberg has ulterior motives for putting it forward As it happens Weisberg has a direct financial interest in perpetuating the idea that Bush is a buffoon Hes the editor of two books of Bushisms and wed venture to guess his royalty checks got mighty slim starting in September The second book More George W Bushisms was published on Christmas Dayjust two weeks agoand ranks a pathetic th in the Amazoncom execobidosASINqidsrrefsr sales rankings

<28971452.1075840337385.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,opinionjournal@wsj.com,2002-01-03 14:34:46,OpinionJournal Best of the Web Today January PST From Best of the Web Today January By JAMES TARANTO Shattered LAWsecretserviceagentindexhtml The Secret Service agent who was booted from an American Airlines flight on Christmas Day has hired a team of Washington lawyers to press his case that he was the victim of profiling Actually the accusation has changed somewhat since the agentidentified by The Weekly Standards Christopher Caldwell ContentPublicArticleshkywzasp as Wallid Shatterfirst lodged the allegation last week As we noted Friday bestid a press release from the Council on American Islamic Relations asparticleasparticleidarticletype claimed that the pilot had singled him out not only because he is ArabAmerican but because he is Muslimthough how anyone was supposed to have known Shatters religion is a mystery Did he unfurl a prayer rug in the aisle of the airplane Presumably the folks at CAIR are aware that three out of four ArabAmericans are Christian CNN reports the pilot submitted a report on the incident to the airline QUOTE In the report the pilot said the incident began when a flight attendant said she and other flight attendants were concerned about the actions of a passenger The passenger had left the aircraft while leaving a carryon bag still in his seat telling flight attendants not to leave without him While the passenger was away the flight attendants observed books in the individuals sic seat which were written in what she assessed was Arabic style print the pilot wrote When the passenger returned the pilot decided to review the paperwork required by law enforcement officials who carry weapons onto planes The form was unreadable because it was a carboncopy and there were missing items the pilot said I then had the agent come back and recheck his credentials and fill out a new form the pilot said but the new form was filled out improperly The passenger appeared nervous and anxious the pilot said The pilot said that as he tried to verify the Secret Service agents credentials the agent became very hostile In the interim I was given a third improperly filled out form This had no signature of the law enforcement officer no phone number END QUOTE Shatter of course was carrying a gun which as a lawenforcement agent he was entitled to dobut one can hardly fault the pilot for wanting to be absolutely certain the firearmtoting passenger was who he claimed he was Its certainly easy to imagine and even to sympathize with Shatters becoming hostile Airportsecurity bureaucracy can be maddening and as a cop hes probably not used to having his authority questioned But one also must sympathize with the airline which as Caldwell notes has of late seen a good deal of its personnel and clientele blown out of the skies by people who fit Shatters profile He goes on QUOTE Or if you dont like profiling lets ignore Shatters profile for a moment Christmas would have to be a highalert daya day on which a bomb or a hijacking would have especially great news value and on which both security and inflight personnel were likely severely understaffed Some guy who claims to be going to see the president tries to get on a planewith a gunand the captain doesnt like the look of his paperwork Specifically Shatter was taking Flight because he had been bumped from an earlier flight According to the captain the information he gave on the form for the second flight didnt match the information hed given on the same form for the first Then to top it off the guy tries to get back on the plane Have you ever left a sweater or a cell phone on a flight and tried to get back down the jetway Being a forgetful person I have What happened even before September was that everyone standing near the gate surrounds you If you show the slightest hint of insisting Aw come on that sweaters got my return ticket on it they get ready to call the cops I was never up until September a big fan of this kind of draconian security on airlines But the point is the airlines have a longstanding record of not messing around when it comes to access to their planesno matter what the passengers color is When American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Mayo says the incident was not about racial profiling but about confirming that an armed individual is who he says he is and that he is qualified to travel we ought to believe her END QUOTE Caldwell quotes CAIR head Ibraham Hooper If Shatter had had the name John Smith and hadnt been of ArabAmerican background there wouldnt have been a problem Wrong says Caldwell John Smith trying to board the flight with the same gun and the same iffy paperwork would have been booted unceremoniously and youd never have heard another word about it because Smith has no civil rights groups to agitate for kidgloves treatment In fact if Wallid Shatter had been named John Smith American Airlines would now be demanding an apology from him rather than vice versa India Gets Serious articlehtml Last months attack on the Indian Parliament pushed New Delhi to the edge of its patience with Pakistanibacked terrorism the Times of London reports QUOTE From ordinary working men and women up to Atal Behari Vajpayee the Prime Minister there is a strong consensus that the Kashmiri insurgency which has been dragging on for a decade with support from Pakistan must be tackled with the same determination that the United States has shown in its campaign against the Taleban and alQaeda in Afghanistan after the attacks on New York and Washington on September END QUOTE Another Times report articlehtml says the terror group LashkariTaiba which is believed to have perpetrated the Parliament attack has threatened to blow up the Taj Mahala Muslim mausoleum And the Press Trust of India nonframdlforasp picks up a Washington Post wpdynarticlesAJanhtml report that as PTI puts it President Pervez Musharraf has left terrorists in Pakistanoccupied Kashmir PoK free to continue their activities in Jammu and Kashmir confining his mild crackdown to Pakistan proper National Reviews Jay Nordlinger impromptusimpromptusshtml takes an optimistic view of Musharraf QUOTE Pakistan and India moved toward war after the attack on the Indian parliament by al Qaedalike militants from Pakistan Musharraf responded that Pakistan was prepared for war if it came to that but he made unmistakably clear that the Pakistani militants were enemies of Pakistan itself He said that such militants had engulfed the country in a nightmare He said that Pakistan faced an internal challenge as much as an external one He said No wicked bigoted extremist will be allowed to derail us and we the vast silent majority must vow not to be voiceless passive onlookers to our own internal destruction You wont often find me tipping my hat to a military dictator but its hard to see how anyone could ride the Pakistani tiger more ably or more daringly than Musharraf is doing it now And let us hope that he is right about that vast silent majority part I suspect he is But they had better recover their voice Perhaps through this dictatorleader they are END QUOTE Did the Caged Bird Sing Speaking of optimism heres Mickey Kauss take on the courtroom defiance of the th hijacker QUOTE Is everything what it seems If you were accused terrorist Zacarias Moussoui and you really had been part of the al Qaeda plot but youd broken down and were blabbing everything to the authorities would you want to give that impression in open court making yourself a potential target for your former comrades Or would you seem defiant and say In the name of Allah I do not have anything to plead Just a thought END QUOTE So Long Salam mainhtm Pakistan has refused to grant political asylum to the Talibans former ambassador to Islamabad Mullah Abdul Salam the Frontier Post reports It is also learnt that these Taliban leaders have also been officially asked to leave Pakistan at the earliest Arab Rocket Science EditionsNewsNewshtml Hezbollah Frances favorite terrorist group bestidfrench tried to help Hamas acquire homemade Katyusha rockets to use in attacks on Israeli civilians the Jerusalem Post reports QUOTE According to the Palestinian Web site AlBawaba Palestinian security officials told Time magazine last month that the rockets are a locally produced adaptation of a North Korean design and that Hizbullah had acquired the rockets from Syrian soldiers in Lebanon and passed them on to Hamas The rockets were then smuggled into the Gaza Strip where a Hamas engineer began duplicating them END QUOTE Shin Bet Israels security agency foiled the plan when it arrested a Hamas operative at the Rafah border crossing as he attempted to travel to Saudi Arabia to organize funding for the project The suspect Osama Zuhar Hamed Karika told investigators that he was instructed to travel under the pretext of wishing to make a pilgrimage to Mecca once there he met with Hamas officials and solicited financial backing Iranian Rocket Science EditionsLatestNewsLatestNewshtml The Post also reports that an Iranian newspaper is criticizing expresident Hashemi Rafsanjanis threat to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons QUOTE Rafsanjani told a crowd at the stadium in Teheran University that the day is approaching in which the Islamic world will possess atomic weapons On that day the strategy of the West will hit a dead end since a single atomic bomb has the power to completely destroy Israel while an Israeli counterstrike can only cause partial damage to the Islamic world he said END QUOTE Noruz a reformist newspaper criticized Rafsanjani and saying the expresidents statements caused damage to the states national interests Our Friends the Belarusans wpdynarticlesAJanhtml Belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of lethal military equipment to Islamic radicalswith terrorists and militant organizations in the Middle East Balkans and Central Asia often the recipients Mark Lenzi writes in a Washington Post oped QUOTE While it is deplorable that Belaruss weapons have been responsible for prolonging civil wars and internal strife in countries such as Tajikistan Angola and Algeria it is particularly disturbing that Sudan a country where Osama bin Laden used to live and one that is known as a haven for terrorists has obtained from Belarus such proven and capable weapon systems as T tanks and Mi Hind Helicopter gunships Weapons sent from Belarus to Sudan either fall into the hands of terrorists or are used in a civil war that has already killed more than million people Despite strong denials from Lukashenko Belarus has been a key partner of Saddam Hussein in his effort to rebuild and modernize Iraqs air defense capability Belarus has violated international law by secretly supplying Baghdad with SA antiaircraft missile components as well as technicians Given that Iraq has repeatedly tried to shoot down US and British aircraft patrolling the UN nofly zonewith more than attempts this year alonecovert BelarusianIraqi military cooperation is disturbing and should set off alarm bells in Western capitals END QUOTE Women for War wpdynarticlesAJanhtml The Washington Post quotes Celinda Lake a Democratic pollster who is an authority on reaching female voters as saying the war on terror has drawn strong support from the fairer sex QUOTE Lake said Bushs war message has had the unusual effect of appealing both to women on the left who are concerned about rights and equity and traditional feminism and to women on the right who were concerned about the Talibans treatment of female Christian missionaries Lake said this is the first war in which polls have shown American women to be as supportive of the hostilities as men END QUOTE This is big news comments Andrew Sullivan And the economy may be perking up as well If I were a Democrat Id be worried right now Stupidity Watch The real purpose of World War IV is to increase property values according to John Stigloe cgibinarticlecgifilegatearchivecarollloydDTL a Harvard professor The federal government was badly shocked after Sept he tells the San Francisco Chronicle The elites thought they had to get the American people focused on something else And so were bombing the hell out of Afghanistan Im sorry to say this but I think thats what

really doesnt like him The New York Daily News reports that in the forthcoming issue of Talk magazine Penn manages to compare OReilly unfavorable with Joe McCarthy Osama bin Laden and even Hitler QUOTE I think that people like the Howard Sterns the Bill OReillys and to a lesser degree the Bin Ladens of the world are making a horrible contribution to society Id like to trade OReilly for Bin Laden This is not a man sitting on the toilet with a smile on his face Hes a grumpy selfloathing joke Theres a long history of people who capitalize on the lowest common demominator of peoples

powerful These guysJoe McCarthy Bill OReillydie like everyone else And when they do their legacy is one of damaging the spirit of good things and they become rather broken pathetic figures And that is

more or less taken control of the Tora Bora region there are hundreds of caves and its possible he could be dead in the bottom of one of them says Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz Some have suggested that bin Laden has slipped across the border to Pakistan and United Press International worldhtm reports that countrys border with Afghanistan remains porous despite reassurances from officials in Islamabad that theyve sealed the border tight Pakistans tribal areas are freepassage zones for Taliban and al Qaedas foreign legionnaires escaping from Afghanistan reports UPIs Arnaud de Borchgrave A visiting reporter was stopped once and when the US passport was produced the civilian security official made clear that Americans were not welcome When asked whether that went for Taliban too he answered Taliban always welcome Wolfowitz issued a warning to Pakistan or any other country that might harbor bin Laden Any country in the world that would knowingly harbor bin Laden would be out of their minds I think they have seen what happened to the Taliban and I think that is probably a pretty good lesson to people not to do that InstaPunditcom offers some additional if fanciful theories on Osamas whereabouts QUOTE Alternate wheres Osama theories We killed him We know hes dead But there are lots of reasons for not telling the world we dont want to trigger any sleepers who might be waiting for just that news to act we dont want to anger the Saudis we want to maximize confusion among al Qaeda survivorsperhaps we were the ones broadcasting phony orders in Osamas voice to

alternate theories hes alive and being interrogated on a US warship hes alive and being interrogated in Pakistan hes alive and being interrogated in India Evidence for the above scenarios none But hey

Saudi interior minister Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz is insisting there is no proof of Saudi involvement in the Sept hijackingseven though of the hijackers were Saudi citizens Its true that Saudi citizens were in the planes but who can be certain whether they were behind the attacks Nayef says Until now no one has found me any proof of this The New Republic kaplanhtml traces Saudi efforts to divert attention from its culpability and toward Israel QUOTE During July and August Crown Prince Abdullah sent Bush several letters each more shrill than the last beseeching the president to pull the reins on Mr Sharon as an Abdullah spokesman describes the correspondence According to a White House adviser one of these letters threatened a return to the summer of a reference to the Arab front that united against Israel prior to the Yom Kippur War Then came September Given that of the hijackers were Saudi one might have expected the monarchy to be somewhat chastened Far from it After September a senior administration official explains the Saudis just wanted to change the topic from themselves So they turned the volume up even louder END QUOTE It was partly in response to Saudi pressure TNRs Lawrence Kaplan contends that Colin Powell made a speech endorsing Palestinian statehood and the Bush administration sent a special envoy Anthony Zinni to the Middle east in hopes of negotiating a ceasefire But the Saudis appear to have overplayed their hand After the latest round of Arab barbarity the administration had little choice but to join Israel in its fight against terror But were the Saudis ever interested in resolving the Palestinian problem This Reuters FamulusIntlreutersasp dispatch suggests not It reports that a Saudi newspaperpresumably reflecting the governments viewsdenounced Yasser Arafat for giving a speech calling for an end to violence against Israel QUOTE In his speech he Arafat pledged to pursue those behind the martyrdom operations which he called suicide attacks He also pledged to pursue Palestinian fighters and to close down Hamas and Islamic Jihad institutions alWatan said in an editorial referring to two militant Palestinian groups Is there a name for all of this other than surrender it asked END QUOTE Arafats speech is plainly a desperation move and it may come too late to make a difference But the Saudis reaction to it both reflects a blind hatred of Jews and suggests they may want to keep the Palestinian conflict alive so as to divert attention from their own repressive policies at home and support for terror and Islamic fundamentalism abroad The Terrorists Arent Listening EditionsNewsNewshtml The Jerusalem Post reports Arafats speech didnt go over well among Palestinian terrorist groups either Hamas and Islamic Jihad issued a leaflet rejecting Arafats call for an end to all armed activities and terror attacks and called for a continuation of the intifada until the end of the occupation They also vowed to continue suicide attacks and denounced the US as the enemy of the Palestinian people threatening to target US targets in the future CNN reports WORLDmeastiraqconferenceindexhtml Saddam Hussein is also trying to get a piece of the Palestinian action urging a meeting of Arab leaders in Mecca to discuss the issue of aggression on Palestinians In National Review Online Victor Davis Hanson hansonhansonshtml pens a dyslogy to Arafat and Saddam QUOTE The bleak situation for these walking anachronisms is worse than the mere fall of Communism and the end to stateorganized antiAmericanism The United States not only defeated Marxists but successfully spread its own culture abroad The result is that South America Asia and Eastern Europe rather like free elections capitalism and secular tolerance For all the brutishness of the new globalism even its most recalcitrant critics welcome international banking communications air travel and intellectual exchange In other words outside of Mr Arafats own close circle and a few sycophants in Baghdad hardly any worker in any state wishes to see continual suicide bombers and poison gas plants on the evening news when there is a chance to catch a Schwarznegger movie read spirited newspapers over coffee and put a little away for a VCR Indeed even individual Arabs at Ground Zero in Jerusalem and Baghdadif they could speak freely without repercussionswould

president of the American Society For Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Before brandishing a scalpel Morello would laser off bin Ladens bushy beard eliminating evidence of hair follicles cut his hair if he has any under that omnipresent white turban and pluck his thick eyebrows The second we alter the eyebrows we alter his appearance said Morello who would also straighten out bin Ladens heavylidded eyes

Saddam tells Knight Ridder that America plans to target places where we think senior alQaida might be trying to escape to or those places where we have tentatively identified possible alQaida people hanging outwhich likely means countries like Somalia Yemen and Sudan But an article in Slate id suggests an attack on Iraq may be in the offing even if not immediately The Webzines Inigo Thomas notes

Third Armys mission during the war was to close with and destroy Iraqs Republican Guard Concludes Thomas A decision to topple Saddam Hussein may not have been made but if the destruction of Iraqs best

multiculturalism of our era there was a first in the White House on December President Bush lit a Hanukkah candle to mark the second day of the minor nonbiblical Jewish festival that now competes with Christmas in all politically correct circles Though Jews comprise no more than per cent of the US populationthere are probably more Muslims though the statistics are unreliableHanukkah is now seen as an event that the US president must officially recognise and celebrate His spokesman Ari Fleischer is Jewish and a couple of weeks ago put his spin on how the White House expected Yasser Arafat to behave in the light of the attacks on Jerusalem and Palestine the most hawkish member of the Bush administration the deputy defence secretary Paul Wolfowitz is also Jewish and vociferously argues for war on Iraq But I have never seen these facts mentioned in the media here as it would be considered unacceptable to do so But how long will it be I wonder before any of the several million US Muslims

Taliban soldiers abducted many women and girls perhaps hundreds or more during their fiveyear rule of Afghanistan according to a chilling report in the Washington Post It is impossible to calculate

At some point soon after Sept listening to Yale students and professors offer rationalizations for the mass murders poverty in the Middle East US foreign policy etc Hornstein had an epiphany Some things were just wrong Just as we should pass absolute moral judgment in the case of rape we should recognize that some actions are objectively bad despite differences in cultural standards and values To me hijacking planes and killing thousands of civilians falls into this category Hurrah A breakthrough A moral judgment Yes Ms Hornstein murdering thousands of people in fact is bad But wait A lifetime of instruction is not sloughed off quite so easily as all that Hornsteins bold moral judgment is not quite so bold as all that Look at her conclusion again To me it begins To me Hijacking planes and killing thousands is not objectively bad after all It is objectively bad only in Hornsteins opinion Indeed she rushes to reassure on this point Others may disagree Others may disagree And she adds It is less important to me where people choose to draw the line than it is that they are willing to draw it at all Oh dear Ms Hornstein push on Go the last mile Go out on the limb of judgment

among others Daniel Pipes and WorldNetDailycom The American left however is confused or afraid QUOTE Warraq contends that because of the work of Edward Said and other theorists the American left has been scared of being called colonialists and imperialists and so has adopted a guiltridden shyness about Islam Yet liberals in other Western countries have been more open to his views Warraq has recently contributed a commentary to the leftleaning British newspaper The Guardian in October Australias Radio National devoted an entire Religion Report program to interviewing him As one Islamic

If the likes of Ms Amiel continue to insist that everyone with a word to say against Israel is an antiSemite she is going to find one day that the world is once more divided neatly between antiSemites and Jews That sounds like an antiSemitic threat Its not Its the last thing I want However potential but conditional sympathisers are alienated so much by Zionist rhetoric that they start singing from

unwarranted in this instance his cautious approach strikes us as eminently sensible As the San Francisco Chronicle cgibinarticlecgifilecaMNDTL reports QUOTE A federal probe conducted last year shows that concern about bogus law enforcement credentials is justified Undercover inspectors using fake law enforcement credentials and badges readily available on the Internet were able to declare themselves armed law enforcement officers and skirt security checkpoints at federal agenciesincluding the CIA FBI and Pentagonand two airports according to the General Accounting Office the investigative arm of Congress which conducted the operation At no time time during the undercover visits were our agents bogus credentials or badges challenged by anyone Robert Hast the GAOs special investigations chief told Congress last year Working in teams of two or three the agents were able to get minivans and satchels that could have been packed with explosives and biological agents past checkpoints The agents were waved around metal detectors at Washingtons Reagan National Airport and Orlando Florida Airport after presenting tickets issued in their undercover aliases and fake credentials Our agents could thus have carried weapons explosives chemicalbiological agents or other dangerous objects onto aircraft GAO manager Gerald Dillingham warned a Senate committee on Sept nine days after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon END QUOTE In a typically hysterical press release asparticleasparticleidarticletype CAIR demanded an apology from American Airlines for removing a Muslim Secret Service agent from a flight apparently based on religious and ethnic profiling QUOTE In a letter faxed today to American Chairman Donald J Carty CAIR wrote We are concerned that American Airlines would arbitrarily deny boarding to a Muslim passenger particularly someone who has one of our nations highest security clearances merely because of his religion or ethnicity The passengers on Flight would actually have been more secure had Agent been allowed to board END QUOTE The decision to keep the agent off the plane may have been erroneous but it was hardly arbitrary After all he was carrying a gun This incident may point to a need for the Secret Service and other lawenforcement agencies to work with airlines on improving ID procedures to avoid future such incidents But why in the world is this issue being raised publicly by a group like CAIR which has an agenda other than the enforcement of laws and protection of American security CAIR claims to know the identity of the agent in question which has not been reported in the press for security reasons CAIR is not releasing his name the press release says Did the agent take his grievance to CAIR instead of his superiors at the Secret Service If so this strikes us as conduct ill befitting a lawenforcement agent A Secret Service man is supposed to be prepared to take a bullet for the president

itinerary The paper cites Israeli intelligence officials who are concerned that the Islamic fanatic may have tried to make contact with Hamas terrorists who are now known to have developed recent links with Osama bin Ladens alQaeda network The Times also adds this intriguing detail QUOTE On December Reid travelled to Brussels and stayed a week during which time he obtained a new British passport from the UK consulate there His previous passport which had pages torn out of it was affixed to the new one which police believe was Mr Reids clumsy way of trying to disguise where he had been The Israeli visa stamp was still in the old document as was the Pakistani visa END QUOTE According to the ABC report Government officials told The Associated Press the nonmetal fuses for the explosives allegedly in Reids shoes may have become wet and been too moist to light preventing him from detonating the charges All this suggests the Reid may not be the brightest candle on the birthday cake His Dad Is Bad but His Mom Is Mum articlehtml The Times of London also has some details about Reids upbringing and in several important respects it resembles that of Marin mujahid John Walker Like Walker Reid is a child of divorce his parents having split when he was four Also like Walker Reid had paternal support for his spiritual journey as the Times put it Mr Reid said that he had encouraged his son to join the faith because he felt it rejected violence And like Walker Reid has a father who is eager to make excuses for him now My son is a determined boy and I can imagine him being determined enough to blow himself to bits the elder Reid tells the Times But I just cant believe that he would want to hurt anyone else in doing it unless that is he has been brainwashed Two differences Whereas Walkers father is a lawyer Reids is a common criminal He was absent for much of Richards childhood after spending time in prison for a series of car thefts and burglaries And

The London Telegraph in an article on Reid has a telling quote from Abdul Haqq Baker the moderate chairman of the Brixton mosque where Reid and th hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui worshipped before taking a more militant route QUOTE Mr Baker said We have a lot of converts and exconvicts Many just turn up with their bags straight from prison They come because we are tolerant and we teach in English But because they are new to Islam they can be easily led Extremists tell them that we are wrong and they are right They brainwash them and take them to study groups away from the mosque where they learn

Late nationalTERRhtmlpagewantedall Just in time for the end of the year and the Pulitzer entries the New York Times link requires registration publishes a very long words plus and detailed narrative of Americas failed antiterror policies from to The Clinton administration part of that story is familiar The administration was aware of the growing threat from al Qaeda and took some steps to counter it but was too distracted by the presidents quest for a legacy and by his actual legacy impeachment to give the matter the kind of sustained attention it needed The most interesting detail though is that President Bush was actually ahead of the curve though alas not by nearly enough QUOTE Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda In July Condoleezza Rice said Mr Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to swatting at flies He said he wanted a plan to bring this guy down END QUOTE As the Washington Post previously reported Bushs national security advisers approved a million antial Qaeda plan But Bush was traveling on the day it was to have been presented to himSept What a Gas articlehtml Documents found in Kabul houses show that al Qaeda had tested chemical weapons including cyanide gas on animals the Times of London reports Al Qaedas knowledge of how to make weapons of mass destruction appears to have been crude and the studies were the work of a variety of autonomous cells who conducted their own experiments without collusion The Times quotes an intelligence expert as saying that this proves a huge problem to the Western security forces What we can see is the work of different potentially selfreplicating cells united only by an ideal They will be far more difficult to extinguish than a centrally organized terrorist force Al Qaeda American Style wpdynarticlesADechtml The FBI is conducting more than separate investigations into groups and individuals in the United States with possible ties to Osama bin Ladens al Qaeda organization the Washington Post reports The domestic targets include dozens of people who are under electronic surveillance through

officials are saying little about the specifics of the investigations Protected by the Federal Government htxnyttsofficialstoeaserequirementsonhiringofairlinescreenershtml After stoking high expectations that the federal takeover of airport security would lead to a new breed of airport security screener one who was better educated and more qualified to assume a position of increased responsibility the Department of Transportation has decided not to impose rules that would displace thousands of current screeners the New York Times reports In particular screeners wont have to have high school diplomas a years work experienceincluding experience in the muchderided preSept airportsecurity systemwill suffice The idea is to allow current screeners who would otherwise qualify but

alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid was more sophisticated than he appeared He had one most important trait He was very calm in an extremely stressful situation Magnus Ranstorp a terrorism expert from Scotland tells the Times The paper adds that even his downandout appearance may have been a reverse undercover strategy based on a calculation that he looked too obvious to be a real threat Bolstering

His profilea lone traveller who bought his ticket in cash and had no baggageraised an automatic red flag His knapsack contained only a Koran a Walkman with religious tapes and a magazine Reid claimed

expense There had been no body search and no sniffer dogs The next morning Reid turned up two hours early for the flight This time security staffrecognising him from the previous daywaved him through

acting alone The Jerusalem Post EditionsNewsNewshtml adds that the explosive was similar to that developed and used by Hamas in suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks Another Observer piece internationalstoryhtml says that Britains MI intelligence agency knew of links between shoe bomber Richard Reid and one September hijack suspect late last year but failed to track Reid before he tried

Rather it is the militant face of a much broader phenomenon the Islamic mission that is a new and astonishing feature of British prison life Theodore Dalrymple commentarystoryhtmlfstorieshtml a British physician who treats prisoners explains Islams appeal to prisoners Bonversion to Islam kills two birds with one stone It fulfils a personal need but it is also an act of revenge upon society for official multiculturalism notwithstanding everyone knows that Western societies are profoundly uneasy about their infiltration by an increasingly confident and militant Islam that uses Western liberal principles to spread itself in the way communism once did Dalrymple notes however that Islam isnt the only religion that wins converts in prison I have noticed a subgroup of prisoners for example who turn to Buddhism while incarcerated They can almost always be recognized physically they sport pony tails and have an air of unnatural and studied calm The ponytailed Buddhist has usually

Vietnam War era Politics was not his bag at Yale when others were marching in support of civil rights and against the war Nor had he yet found religion as the guiding light of his life He surely knows he was a different person back then The president has often sought to dismiss his youthful escapades with the cute tautology When I was young and foolish I was young and foolish There undoubtedly are many who want Walker to pay with his life But there are a lot of others in the country who will want Bush to go easier on Walkera lighter sentence perhapswith compassion lighting his way I hope so Were a forgiving people This young man obviously made a big mistake The president should show that he understands this by setting a merciful course in the Walker case END QUOTE Before urging forgiveness wouldnt it be a good idea at least to wait and see if Walker repents and acknowledges he did wrong So far as we know theres been no indication hes done so More important Thomass logic is morally slovenly Why is Walker entitled to more compassion than the Afghans Arabs Pakistanis Chechens and other natives of Muslim lands whove fought for the Taliban and al Qaeda If anything a far better argument can be made that they are victims of circumstance having had an upbringing in an environment that encourages Islamic fanaticism Walker on the other hand plainly chose to abandon his country and join its enemies Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists President Bush said in his historic Sept speech Helen Thomas it appears would have Bush add a qualification unless

requires registration reports that some conservative Tennesseans are outraged over a piece of public art QUOTE At first few noticed their five famous wordsWorkers of the world uniteinscribed among dozens of other quotations outside the gleaming new million Memphis Central Library which opened in November But then this phrase from the Communist Manifesto caught the eye of two county commissioners and a city councilman and in these days of heightened patriotism a smoldering debate was ignited on a popular radio talk show in the letters and opinion column of The Commercial Appeal of Memphis and in the three politicians own correspondence and phone calls For the directors of the library and the UrbanArt Commission the semipublic agency that commissioned the sidewalk art in which the revolutionaries words make an appearance these patriotic stirrings miss the point They point out that Marx and Engels take their turn on the library pavement alongside as varied a bunch as

jousting about an imaginary enemy is not very productive Well OK the whole thing is kind of silly Still we have just one question Suppose instead of a commie slogan it was a Confederate flag among the various icons on the sidewalk and instead of conservatives it was blacks who were objecting Would the Times and Ken Jackson mock them as a bunch of rubes throwing a tantrum Editors Note This column

the Pakistanis usnovnyhtm A series of reports from the Indian press reminds us of the degree to which Americas Pakistani allies may have been culpable in the attacks of Sept The IndoAsian News Service quotes an Indian intelligence official According to reports based on information from the Northern Alliance up to Pakistan Army regulars could be holed up in Kunduz There are reports that Pakistani officers of the rank of colonel are still in Kunduz the last Taliban stronghold in northern Afghanistan Earlier the Press Trust of India reported that a pair of Pakistani helicopters usnovnyhtm had evacuated a group of Pakistani military officers including two brigadiers from Kunduz Indian intelligence officials said these forces were part of Pakistani army units seconded to Taleban ranks for command and control operations PTI reports adding QUOTE Defence experts in Delhi wondered how Pakistani choppers could have entered Afghan air space and landed in Kunduz with the US Air Force having tight control over the Afghan skies They said the operation could not have been carried out without a nod from the US It has to be done with US connivance and therefore poses vital questions about Americas aims and objectives they added END QUOTE According to another PTI report the country formerly known as Burma newsnovpakhtm has granted sanctuary to two Pakistani nuclear scientists following a request from Islamabad The scientists Suleiman Asad and Mohammad Ali Mukhtar helped develop Pakistans nuclearweapons program and are suspected of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist organization Islamabad assured authorities in TCFKAB that the duo were not involved in any terrorist activity PTI reports All this bolsters our Tunku Varadarajan columniststvaradarajanid s observation that it would be a mistake for America to view Pakistans dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf as a true friend He is rather an ally of convenience doing Washingtons bidding lest he be destroyed At least Musharraf is smart enough to know which way the wind is blowing The Associated Press reports Pakistan has closed the Talibans embassy in Islamabad haptspakistangoodbyetalibanhtml and the IANS adds that Pakistan is planning to open a mission in the eastern Afghanistan city of Jalalabad in a virtual recognition of the Northern Alliance Our Friends the Spanish htxnmtsattackspainextraditiondchtml Spain may refuse to extradite eight suspected al Qaeda members to America because America has the death penalty Spain has been a democracy for barely a quarter century after more than three decades of military dictatorship but its leaders are imbued with such a sense of moral superiority that they feel free to dictate domestic policy to the United States Does anyone know the Spanish word for chutzpah Somali Internet Shut Down hienglishworldafricanewsidstm Somalias only Internet service provider the Somalia Internet Co has been forced to shut down after appearing on the US list of terrorist sponsors the BBC reports Barkaat a Somali telecom company has also been shut Seems to us the Beeb buried the lead though The real news here is that Somalia even had Internet access Unforgettable wpdynarticlesANovhtml Have the Taliban been taking advice from Bill Clintons old spin doctors The Associated Press reports from Spinboldak Afghanistan that a Taliban spokesman said the world should move on and forget about the Sept attacks in the United States Heres the quote from Syed Tayyab Agha You should forget the Sept attacks because now there is a new fighting against Muslims and Islam and the international and global terrorists like America and Britain they are killing daily our innocent people In response Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz says We are moving on and I think before long the world will forget about the Taliban The Taliban have got to be the most ridiculous bunch of barbarians the world has seen in a long time Last week recall top Talib Mullah Mohammad Omar vowed to destroy the US bestid then said hed leave Kandahar bestid This week he decided to stay put because of a prophetic dream bestid Now his underlings want us to forget an unforgettable atrocity What can one do but laugh Even Sept is hardly evidence of the Talibans fearsomeness After all the Taliban didnt blow up the World Trade Center they merely rented out their country to the terrorists who did Thats enough to justify destroying the Taliban but not enough to justify taking them seriously Zoo Time articlehtml The Times of London reports on the Talibans treatment of the eight international aid workers they kidnapped QUOTE Cruel games with a gun maggoty food and regular parades of the women before their guards were part of life behind bars for the captives The women prisoners were a source of fascination for the jailers and their commanders Every evening members of the Taleban Foreign Ministry accompanied by a clutch of bearded strangers would visit the cells and demand that the women stand by the bars Wordlessly they would stare at the women from head to toe The prisonerswho were never touched or abusedcalled the session zoo time The youngest of the German prisoners Kati Jellinek was blonde and of particular interest to the Taleban When she was arrested five men with Kalashnikovs demanded that she pack unpack and repack her underwear END QUOTE Meanwhile the Associated Press WORLDasiapcfcentralgenkabulzooapindexhtml reports Afghans dont treat actual zoo animals much better Marijan the lion at the Kabul zoo has only one eye just like Mullah Omar Heres how it happened QUOTE During the roaring s after the Russians left an Afghan guerrilla showing off for his friends jumped over the guard rail into the den and teased the lion Marjan ate him The next day the guerrillas brother applied the Afghans strict code of revenge He tossed a hand grenade at the lion Marjan expecting food pounced on it The blast put out his eye and nearly killed him On another black day a different Afghan guerrilla amused himself by firing a rocketpropelled grenade at the elephant END QUOTE No word whether the Taliban asked the elephant to forget about that indignity Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself newsmainjhtmlxmlnewswarxmlsSheetportalixporthtml The headline of a London Telegraph piece on the standoff in Kunduz proclaims US Fears Massacre of Foreign Fighters Sure we do About as much as the foreign fighters feared a massacre of US civilians back in September An Enemy Surrenders The Web site PreventAfghanWarorg set up to urge America to surrender to terrorism has itself surrendered QUOTE This web site was intended as a place to gather and focus the opinions of American sic who believe that going to war with Afghanistan in an action like Desert Storm is not the way for the United States to respond to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other terrorists sic acts of September On October the military action began Then it was not clear if this is an American verses sic Afghanistan war or has evolved into a coalition of countries against terrorists based in Afghanistan The situation changed significantly by November Events have seemed to render the purpose of this web site moot War and now the displacement of the Afghanistan government by the Northern Aliance sic is becoming a fact Therefore this web site is being taken down at least for the time being END QUOTE Our Friends the Oregonians nationalPORThtml We noted on Wednesday bestidportland that the Portland Ore police department is refusing to cooperate with the US Justice Departments efforts to investigate terrorism An article in the New York Times link requires registration offers a clue as to the motivations of Portlands acting police chief Andrew Kirkland QUOTE Mr Kirkland who is black said his own background had also played a role in his decision I grew up in Detroit he said and I hated the police with a passion They were always stopping and bothering me END QUOTE What kind of city would put someone who hates the police in charge of its police department Whats next a commander in chief who loathes the military Stupidity Watch ArchiveArticlehtml One Humera Khan offers the following pearl of wisdom in Londons Guardian QUOTE While the Taliban were imposing their beliefs and reducing freedom on one side the same can be said of the maledominated and often misogynistic fashion industry on the other The question of which is the more ruthless form of persuasion the lashes of the Taliban or the multimillionpound advertising flashes of the fashion industry remains a moot point END QUOTE Extremist Relations timeasianewsdailyhtml The Asian edition of Time magazine carries a charming report on postTaliban sexual liberation in Afghanistan Najib a yearold MazareSharif man is waiting for his one true love to return her family fled to Uzbekistan when the Taliban took over QUOTE The pair used to meet regularly sometimes holding hands and once just before the Taliban came Shabnam spent the night with Najib at his home She wanted to have extremist relations he explains But I controlled myself I told her I was not ready She was very upset but then I pampered her and she began to smile again In the end we just embraced He muses over Shabnams voracious sexual appetite Women are very strangeyou cannot understand them When they meet Najib says they would just look at each other and shake hands Islam does not permit kissing he pauses but maybe I wont be so holy one day END QUOTE Less liberated are the US Navy women on the USS Theodore Roosevelt who the Washington Post wpdynarticlesANovhtml reports are complaining about a visit by six Miami Dolphins cheerleaders aimed at boosting the morale of the ships men Its good for the cheerleaders to
