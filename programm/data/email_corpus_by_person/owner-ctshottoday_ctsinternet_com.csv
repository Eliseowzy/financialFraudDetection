Today is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day Harness the Power of Confluence The Websters definition of confluence is To come together or flow together like two streams converging into a river For technical trading confluence is a very powerful concept For example a stochastics crossover from oversold levels has no statistical significance on its own merit However as soon as you say the trend is up then entering on the crossover produces positive results is some markets Furthermore lets say the oversold stochastics has formed while prices are testing major chart support or perhaps the breakout point of a weekly price pattern or congestion areas Thats a higher standard of confluence For a current example of confluence lets examine the Canadian dollar Trend is down as quantified by the CTS trend arrows Long and Int Correction has unfolded in a text book zigzag correction that has retested the neckline of a massive head and shoulder top as seen on the weekly chart at The zigzag correction shows A and C are equal and both break down into legs Daily stochastics show a trend confirmation sell signal with a clear failure point above the neckline Todays gap lower open has caused daily stochastics to cross and confirms the entire scenario Bringing together two or more technical indicators or observations that point in the same direction is called confluence My experience has shown me that the more technical evidence I can stack in my corner the higher the probability of the desired outcome Now please dont misunderstand what Im saying I dont believe accurate technical analysis on it own produces a high probability of winning trades A high probability of winning comes from your exit strategy If you keep your expected profitloss ratio small then you will win on greater than of your trades However if you look for the big ratio to or higher then youre doing well to win on anything greater than of your trades One of the greatest exercises my Father passed down to me was using all charting time frames to establish confluence before taking a trade You start with the monthly chart go to the weekly chart then to the daily and finally the hourly Write down on each chart what the indicators are saying and what price patterns have formed If you find a market that has bullish evidence on every time frame then you have a great candidate for a long entry I like taking the CTS Market Selector list of strong trending markets and doing a complete monthly chart to minute chart review searching for confluence The great trades almost always have substantial evidence from multiple time frames before unfolding Another case and point is Feeders The monthly and weekly charts clearly identified a major up trend in motion and a bullish price pattern several weeks ago We had confluence on the daily price patterns and stochastics trend confirmation signals Hogs and bellies recently had the same type of confluence and that lead directly to my point winner in Hogs after commissions winner The Yen is another market with major confluence The downside breakout of the prior month old trading range was recently followed by a pause Since we just took out last weeks low this pattern now projects major downside potential A quick view of the monthly chart shows the prior multiyear rally could be an ABC correction Can you see the concept of confluence at work here Homework Review the list of CTS Market Selector bull markets and find the ones that have confluence on all time frames MWD Feel free to email me your observations and Ill respond if youd like N Key Technical Developments close of March cotton dropped to new week lows following the USDA report The price pattern looks like an island top with a see through gap Only a rally above the gap over the next few trading sessions will turn the technical positive March Japanese Yen closed down points and dropped below last weeks low A further

patterns on the hourly charts The hourly Elliott wave patterns are tradable because you know quickly when youre wrong This routine may or may not work for you The main point Im trying to make is that

Today is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead Nicks Trading Tip of the Day Develop a Solid Daily Routine A classic from the archives Some of the best traders I know are incredibly disciplined about their daily routine They believe their routine gives them an edge and they will not trade with out it For your benefit I will describe the routine that my Father passed along to me It all starts with the Benjamin Franklin secret to success Early to bed and early to rise In bed by PM ET and up at am ET Watch CNBC for to minutes to see what developed in over night action Exercise for minutes and then have a well balanced breakfast Arrive at the trading desk by am EST Print out all CTS weekly and daily charts and look for our preferred technical setups Look for well established trends that were under going intermediate term corrections back to major support resistance levels After finding the best to trade opportunities for that day go to the hourly charts If inclined to buy consider waiting until hourly stochastics are oversold For new shorts require stochastics to be overbought To refine timing for entry and exit look for clear cut Elliott wave patterns or classical price patterns on the hourly charts The hourly Elliott wave patterns are tradable because you know quickly when youre wrong This routine may or may not work for you The main point Im trying to make is that every trader needs a routine that he or she believes in The routine helps you focus your research and thus maximize your ability to find winning trades N Key Technical Developments close of The
