Glen J Watson Steven TPSAW Lorenz Lad TPLPL Nelson Eric B TPEBN Subject RE GIR Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in the errata Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions The first Wheeler Ridge was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as proposed by PGE especially if it would gain their nonopposition There was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the settlement As for the Pooling Revisions Dynegy expressed reservations about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number of pools available per shipper Dynegy was not able to garner internal approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today so Pooling revisions were taken off the table SoCalGas supports the pooling revisions and no other party expressed any concerns ALJ Biren asked us to file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to mail it out to the parties today so our already compressed deadline for getting this out the door was even more compressed Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the outstanding differences I could not include the revisions that were circulated to our dismay PGE has now indicated they will file limited opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with regard to

including Calpine SCE WHP and WGS and no opposition was voiced It is my understanding that PGE will not sign on to the Settlement even if this change is made but will agree not to oppose this issue and many others Not only does the change itself make sense but there is a lot of value in not having another front to do battle on in the hearing process Is SoCalGas opposed to this change And if so

an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit as proposed provided it is revised to reflect the changes and additions El

Revisions The first Wheeler Ridge was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as proposed by PGE especially if it would gain their nonopposition There was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the settlement As for the Pooling Revisions Dynegy expressed reservations about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number of pools available per shipper Dynegy was not able to garner internal approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today so Pooling revisions were taken off the table SoCalGas supports the pooling revisions and no other party expressed any concerns ALJ Biren asked us to file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to mail it out to the parties today so our already compressed deadline for getting this out the door was even more compressed Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the outstanding differences I could not include the revisions that were circulated to our dismay PGE has now indicated they will file limited opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with regard to

an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit as proposed provided it is revised to reflect the changes and additions El

an email containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be made to SoCalGas draft Exhibit which was distributed for further comment to parties on June This email has two attachments The first attachment is a revised copy of SoCalGas table titled Firm Pipeline Capacity into Southern California with changes to a correct the amount of firm interstate capacity on El Paso at Topock shown in the col Incoming Interstate Capacity by replacing the incorrect figure MMcfd which includes capacity for delivery to SW Gas which is not available to California on a firm basis with the correct figure MMcfd b delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from the col Total Takeaway Capacity since this capacity is not firm capacity available to California c adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols affected by these changes d add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El Paso have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to SoCalGas totaling MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas takeaway capacity at Topock and clearly creates a mismatch and c add reference in footnote to the physical capacity of KernMojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at Wheeler Ridge South which is in excess of MMcfd even though the metering is currently set to MMcfd The second attachment contains two schematics intended to supplement SoCalGas draft map of receipt points and interconnections These schematics more accurately reflect the actual physical interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate impression that the interconnect with El Paso at Topock consists of several separate pipelines with no cross over and that inaccurate impression that several interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road El Paso understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to Administrative Law Judge Birens request for a late filed exhibit concerning mismatches and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas receipt points In the spirit of compromise El Paso will not oppose SoCalGas filing an exhibit as proposed provided it is revised to reflect the changes and additions El

Revisions The first Wheeler Ridge was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as proposed by PGE especially if it would gain their nonopposition There was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the settlement As for the Pooling Revisions Dynegy expressed reservations about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number of pools available per shipper Dynegy was not able to garner internal approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today so Pooling revisions were taken off the table SoCalGas supports the pooling revisions and no other party expressed any concerns ALJ Biren asked us to file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to mail it out to the parties today so our already compressed deadline for getting this out the door was even more compressed Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the outstanding differences I

be providing testimony on retail unbundling for the utilities I agree with you that the mass market retail parties should also include complementary testimony Although we discussed this earlier I did not receive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor such testimony it may be an oversight on my part Nonetheless retail testimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits from Greenmountaincom Utilitycom CUB REMAC and the others Might I suggest that Enron as a large massmarketer itself coordinate this effort with the other retail partners In addition I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the hearings which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month We will need to make some time available during late May for practice panels assuming we are granted panel hearings and individual practice crossexamination At the same time we also need to start thinking about direct crossexamination of the SCGCTURN parties again assuming we decide to engage in full crossexamination of their settlement There is merit to crossexamination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well thought out results in substantial costshifts and is not consistent with the Commissions most promising options On the other hand there is merit to limiting our cross especially of Florio who will use the witness box to grandstand Its something to think about Original Message From MBD mailto MSSRcom Sent Tuesday April AM To Cherry Brian TPBKC Leslie John Elsesser Evie McCrea Keith Pocta R Mark Dasovich Jeff Beach Tom

established May as the date that testimony is due in support of all settlements filed on April and April While she may offer additional guidance at the PHC on April we need to start the process of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement We have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting the testimony as identified below The testimony will be based on a hub and spoke approach where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of unbundling describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling process will work with other parties filing testimony that complements SoCalGas testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why the settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers the state of California mom and apple pie you get the picture In addition I would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts I suggest we adhere to the following schedule April Draft Outlines of Testimony Optional April st Draft Testimony May nd Draft Testimony May File Testimony wCommission I think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so that everyone knows what will be filed on the May The schedule is compressed but we have to operate within the time parameters weve been given The testimony assignments are identified below There has been one change from what we had agreed to previously SoCalGas will sponsor a witness on the Concepts of Unbundling I would also like to suggest that we file the testimony a one comprehensive document I have suggested a chapterstyle format that might work but I am open to

<29968535.1075843093822.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,bcherry@sempra.com,2000-04-18 06:13:00,RE May Testimony Preparation GIRNGS Cc Mike We shall make the additions you noted below SoCalGas Eric Nelson will be providing testimony on retail unbundling for the utilities I agree with you that the mass market retail parties should also include complementary testimony Although we discussed this earlier I did not receive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor such testimony it may be an oversight on my part Nonetheless retail testimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits from Greenmountaincom Utilitycom CUB REMAC and the others Might I suggest that Enron as a large massmarketer itself coordinate this effort with the other retail partners In addition I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the hearings which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month We will need to make some time available during late May for practice panels assuming we are granted panel hearings and individual practice crossexamination At the same time we also need to start thinking about direct crossexamination of the SCGCTURN parties again assuming we decide to engage in full crossexamination of their settlement There is merit to crossexamination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well thought out results in substantial costshifts and is not consistent with the Commissions most promising options On the other hand there is merit to limiting our cross especially of Florio who will use the witness box to grandstand Its something to think about Original Message From MBD mailto MSSRcom Sent Tuesday April AM To Cherry Brian TPBKC Leslie John Elsesser Evie McCrea Keith Pocta R Mark Dasovich Jeff Beach Tom

Subject RE May Testimony Preparation GIRNGS Brian Thanks for your memo Let me add the following comments There should be a chapter on the retail settlement with the key parties listed Tom Beach and Vernon should be added to the chapter on impact on electric generators The Core Interstate Unbundling section where you list TXU and Shell was I believe originally supposed to include program benefits for the core aggregators as well and you should add Enron to the list for that Chapter Let me know if you concur with my recollection Thanks Mike Day Original Message From Cherry Brian TPBKC mailto

Gillian TPGXW Watson Steven TPSAW Betonte Robert TPRSB Barker David TPDTB Peterson Lorraine TPLMP Martin Collette Leitzinger Jeff Subject May Testimony Preparation GIRNGS As you know ALJ Biren has established May as the date that testimony is due in support of all settlements filed on April and April While she may offer additional guidance at the PHC on April we need to start the process of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement We have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting the testimony as identified below The testimony will be based on a hub and spoke approach where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of unbundling describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling process will work with other parties filing testimony that complements SoCalGas testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why the settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers the state of California mom and apple pie you get the picture In addition I would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts I suggest we adhere to the following schedule April Draft Outlines of Testimony Optional April st Draft Testimony May nd Draft Testimony May File Testimony wCommission I think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so that everyone knows what will be filed on the May The schedule is compressed but we have to operate within the time parameters weve been given The testimony assignments are identified below There has been one change from what we had agreed to previously SoCalGas will sponsor a witness on the Concepts of Unbundling I would also like to suggest that we file the testimony a one comprehensive document I have suggested a chapterstyle format that might work but I am open to
