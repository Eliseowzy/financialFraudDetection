the clips it says the Front line show is airing tonight Ill dig up TVA for you Jeannie June AM Houston Chronicle PBS pledge drive alters schedule By MIKE McDANIEL Copyright Houston Chronicle TV Editor Paul Hope like many theater fans tuned to Channel Sunday night in anticipation of the first hour of the joint PBSCBS telecast of the th Annual Tony Awards W hat he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa Because this is pled ge drive week Channel did not air the first hour of the threehour award show as it has in previous years Channel has made Houston a theatric al cowtown by this decision Hope a resident actor at the Alley said Mon day Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting absolutel y indefensible and shocking Fortunately Channel is being more flexibl e about a second program that it had originally decided not to air this wee k Frontline which airs nationally at pm tonight takes a hard look a t Californias energy problems and their direct connection to Houston The telecast includes interviews with several Houston players including Enron s Kenneth Lay KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel became aware of the Frontline story titled Blackout and its Houston connection last w eek Because of its local news value the show will be tapedelayed and air ed on KUHT at tonight It will be repeated at pm June when Chann el originally had planned to air the show When we learned of the local significance we obviously wanted that program to air here in a timely m anner as in the rest of the country Hesse said We are getting a little bit of heat for the Tony thing Hesse said The problem is its right i n the beginning of our pledge evening We had a schedule in place and a de cision was made to stick to that schedule because that was our opportunity for fund raising Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and to purchase quality programming When were scheduling our pledge dates we try to coordinate the normal PBS schedule with what we determine will d o the best for us in terms of fund raising Hesse said We only use about percent of our air time a year in fundraising efforts and when were u sing that percent we have to make the most of them Thats no comfort to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out to be theatrical history being made Mel Brooks The Producers not only the talk of Broa dway but also the entertainment world won a record Tonys Sunday night Most were awarded in the shows first hour where Tonys for director choreographer and other categories are handed out To diehards the PBS por tion of the Tonys exceeds CBS in that it airs without commercials and incl udes behindthescenes interviews with directors composers designers and others Hesse explained that Channel s pledgedrive dates were set befor e the station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys The first hour o f Sundays show had direct links to theater talents whose work has been see n and heralded in Houston David Woolard nominated for best costume desig n for The Rocky Horror Show is costume designer of The Carpetbaggers Chil dren which opens Wednesday at the Alley Doug Besterman a winner Sunday for his orchestrations for The Producers has done the same for the Frank Jekyll and Hyde Wildhorn productions that have played here Doug Schmidt a nominee in the scenic design category for nd Street was a designer fo r the Alleys Civil War and A Christmas Carol Hesse said We knew by the end of March that PBS would cohost Sundays show and yet the decision was made to stick with the schedule in place Because the Tonys isnt ow ned by PBS it could not be used as a pledge show although Hesse conceded pledges could have been sought before and after Theres nothing against the rules he said Its just been our normal method of operation her e to run the pledge drive at pm in terms of our primetime evening pl edge start In a related development NBC affiliate KPRC will not be show ing the first episode of a new comedy series bowing tonight Kristin starr ing Kristin Chenoweth is being preempted by Road to Redemption a movie f unded by the Billy Graham Crusade Channel made a decision in March to r un the movie tonight KPRC general manager Steve Wasserman said NBC has scheduled the premiere of Kristin for pm and is not allowing it to air later in prime time he said
