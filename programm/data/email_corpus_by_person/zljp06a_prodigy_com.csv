DOW has rallied to over The accumulationdistribution indicators have turned extremely positive meaning institutions and mutual funds have started buying stocks We believe it is time for investors to get back into the market Our next recommendation Dtomi Inc OTCBBDTMI could be one of our top picks of the year For this reason we here are giving DTMI our highest rating of Strong BuyAggressive Growth Stock Symbol DTMI Shares Outstanding Float estimated estimated Rating Strong BuyAggressive Growth Current Price Target Price About the Company DTMI is a technology company that turns data into market intelligence DTMI combines very sophisticated proprietary software that intelligently researches every aspect of business to business databases for company information products and manufacturing capacity DTMI utilizes these proprietary databases to create algorithms that compile and sell highdemand corporate intelligence and marketing information DTMIs combination of technology and expertise quickly identifies new markets and prospects for clients marketing departments According to DTMIs management the company has become one of the leading aggregator and distributors of data from disparate corporate sources This data is melded into a collective powerful interlocking matrix of valuable and concise information Using DTMIs Market Intelligence Tools a clientcompany can compile a comprehensive market report including total market valuation pinpoint each unique segment within that market determine the va luation and number of companies that make up that segment then identify actual buyers of its products Simply put the value of DTMI to a clientcompany is this the comprehensive analysis that DTMI compiles for its clients is usually done in one day or less and costs on average to Using a companys own marketing and research department to compile the same information and generate similiar quality leads would take weeks or months and cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars Revised Earnings In todays economic climate of layoffs and costcutting companies are looking for ways to save money DTMI offers a service they cannot afford to pass up DTMI management is seeing such a rapid acceleration in the number of companies coming to it for services it has recently revised earnings projections upward Also DTMI is signing up clients with longerterm engagements than management had originally projected This is just one of the reasons we are strongly recommending this stock Market Place Sales of Business Information are expected to reach Billion by according to Verronis Suhler DTMIs market intelligence segment is expected to reach billion in the next several years As we stated earlier DTMIs technology can yield detailed market intelligence in a matter of minutes compared to weeks or more to cultivate the similar data through traditional means and at an incredible savings We believe DTMIs technology is far above its competitors and that it can capture a huge share of its market Conclusion We believe market penetration of is very achievable for DTMI That could potentially mean an estimated millionplus in revenues per year Should the company achieve even half those revenues our target price will be raised significantly At million in revenues and with a net margin earnings would be million Aftertax income would be per share At a PE ratio the stock would be worth per share but remember thats half of what we think it could achieve Also according to management based on early feedback from customers new business will not be a problem You can see why we are excited about this stock Additionally this company just started trading at and based on the companys quick move out of the blocks Wall Street is paying attention At these current price levels the stock is difficult for us to ignore It looks like DTMI is in a strong upward trend climbing to higher levels INVESTING IN SECURITIES IS SPECULATIVE AND CARRIES A CERTAIN
