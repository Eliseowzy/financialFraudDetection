suggestions are below Thanks Heather for the helpful update Original Message From Mathis Heather SentTuesday July PM ToBolton Stacey Ring Richard Castano Marianne SubjectCA BIZMIX Issues Hello all I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar ding the DASRing of customers in California Unfortunately it wasnt what we wanted to hear On the easy side of things all residential customers PGE SCE SDGE wer e turned back to the utilities starting May th DASRs were submitted and they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles etc These customers received a letter letting them know about it On the commercial side of things Diann had no distinctions between small c ommercial large commercial industrial customers SDGE customers have been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed In PGE SCE IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu ously received our product All other PGE SCE customers were originally submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on January That prov ides enough issues of its own but Ill get to that PGE did a virtual swi tch so as of Jan all these customers became PGEs again but with SCE w hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles etc All deDASRed customers were then reDASRed back to us starting June and Di ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were reDASRed but ne w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS Red to us No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome rs but as we discussed some personal basis notice may have been given to our larger customers through the reps So Im not worried about the residential side well have to send them a n annual historical label next April with perhaps a letter explaining why theyre still receiving info from us As far as the commercialindustrial No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers Bolt on Stacey We or PR should prepare a customer letter as discussed with Peggy notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP Theyve been receiving system mix since Feb and weve been proceeding as if it were actually BIZMIX ie the nd quarter labels they just rece ived indicated BIZMIX as appropriate to the customer Bolton Stacey W e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w e will be more than off of our projection v what we actually delivered The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual and you dont have to show an extra column w the difference if you are win del ta band between projection and actual We can change the projection for t hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter What are the new customers those as being DASRed to us the first time as of June being told they are receiving Are they being marketed BIZM IX Bolton Stacey We should ensure this is not the case with originati on Someone in Jeremy Bs shop will most likely know As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes will we just use those given as the date of submission ie Jan May June as it is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred Bolto n Stacey We should discuss this a bit Im not sure that this will rea lly matter at the end of the day The CEC has instructed us all along to s end labels to the customers which we have Well report the purchases br own and green as normal at the end of the year Let me know your input Heather Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

MathisHOUEES on PM SANDY COFER LGMCOM on PM To cc JOHN KLAUBERG JKLAU LGMCOM JOHN MAAS LGMCOM SubjectME Direct Mini Form Sarah Attached for your review are i a clean version of ME direct mini form i i a redline of the ME direct mini form marked to show changes against the TX form provided in your email iii a terms of service document iii a disclosure label and iv a customer authorization statement The following is a brief explanation of changes and a few provisions of the Maine Rules we wanted to draw to your attention Direct Mini Form As discussed weve updated the term under Section and under Durati on and Kind of Contract in the terms of service summary to reflect the cu stomers option of a month month month or month term In Maine certain consumer protection provisions such as customer rescis sion rights and provision of the disclosure label and terms of service summ ary apply to residential and small commercial customers less than kW o f demand only As it is our understanding that the direct marketing campa ign will target small commercial customers we have drafted the direct mini form terms of service and disclosure label with that customer class in m ind Weve left the requirement of concurrent execution of the customer author ization form in Section i and Section unchanged although the Rules o nly require that this document be obtained prior to initiating service Se e WCMR Da As the goal of the direct marketing campaig n is to simultaneously obtain an executed agreement and customer authorizat ion form we believe this is a clean way to manage the administration of do cuments and avoid confusion On a similar note and as discussed in connection with the MA direct mini form weve drafted the five day customer rescission period in Section t o run from the execution of the agreement with a notation that the terms o f service and disclosure label are provided concurrently with the agreement The Rules however provide that the rescission period runs five busines s days from the customers receipt of the terms and service summary which m ust be received by the customer days following execution of the agreemen t ie the MPUC envisions i the execution of the contract ii a time passage of up to days iii the delivery of the terms of service summa ry and disclosure label to the customer followed by iv a five business d ay right of rescission running from that date of the customers receipt of the terms of service and disclosure label See WCMR C As d iscussed in connection with the TX direct mini form we believe many commis sions including the PUCT and MPUC envision the terms of service document to behave and function more in the manner of how we would typically conside r a contract to behave and function Our thought process in drafting the r escission period in the ME form to run from the execution of the agreement is provide a clean way for EESI to manage the administration of the documen ts due to the unique mechanics of the transaction the simultaneous deliver y of the agreement terms of service disclosure label and customer authori zation statement by the sales rep to the customer followed by the immediate execution of the agreement and customer authorization statement We want ed to point out that as drafted however this provision is technically inc onsistent with the Rules To provide uniformity across forms we have not changed the language und er Security which provides that EESI may request security as provided in the Rules We wanted to point out however that the ME Rules do not restrict the amount of deposits required by competitive electricity provide rs CEPs Weve revised Section Your Signature and Notices and the Representati ons and Warranties section under the GTCs to model the ME Rules by deletin g references to Your Rights as a Customer Statement a document unique to Texas and changed references to electricity facts label to disclosure label MEs description of the label as opposed to TXs The ME Rules require a day notice to the customer in the event of term ination due to the customers default See WCMR G Wev e updated the Default and Early Termination section of the GTCs to refle ct this requirement By obtaining a license as a CEP in ME EESI thereby agrees to i submit to jurisdiction in the courts of the state of Maine ii that all legal pr oceedings relating to disputes will be maintained in ME courts or before ME administrative agencies and iii that all contracts for generation servi ce in ME with a demand of kW or less will be interpreted according to M E law See WCMR B Weve updated the governing law provi sion to reflect Maine jurisdiction Terms of Service As discussed the Maine Rules were modeled after the Massachusetts Rules an d many items such as the terms of service summary and disclosure label ar e practically identical in format and content As such weve modeled the ME terms of service summary and disclosure label after the documents provid ed in MA with a few notable exceptions The ME Rules require a listing in the terms of service summary of condit ions under which a credit reporting agency is contacted for an applicants credit history or under which the Competitive Supplier reports the customer s payment history to a credit reporting agency See WCMR D d Under Credit Information weve provided general information th at the agreement will not be effective unless and until the credit standard s established by EESI are met that it is EESIs practice to perform credit checks on all applicants whereby EESI may contact a credit reporting agenc y to obtain the customers credit history and that in the event of nonpaym ent under the Agreement it is possible that EESI would report such nonpaym ent to a credit reporting agency The Rules do not restrict the amounts of deposits nor is the CEP required to pay any interest on deposit in ME The terms of service however requ ires the CEP to notify the customer as to deposit requirements and interest on deposits most likely as a measure for the customer to compare services offered by competing CEPs See WCMR De As currently drafted the terms of service provides that security deposits may be requi red and interest will not be paid to the customer if such a deposit is obta ined The Rules require that the terms of service if applicable notify the cu stomer of the CEPs ability to assign the agreement to another CEP without t he customers consent See WCMR Dm Weve provided und er Assignment that EESI will notify the customer in the event of an assig nment which in any way affects the customers rights and obligations under the agreement The Rules require the terms of service document to conspicuously disclose the customers right of rescission and how it may be exercised See WCMR Di Weve drafted the Information on Rescission Rights section with a box around it to satisfy the requirement that the disclosu re be conspicuous Please note that the Rules require the terms of service to list and we h ave left brackets around the toll free number and hours that a customer ca n contact the CEP for customer questions and complaints See WCMR Dj Disclosure Label As the ME label is almost identical to the MA disclosure label weve mad e similar changes to convert the label to a fixed price rather than variabl e price product Heather Mathis is coordinating with the commercial team t o verify the accuracy of the data esp the avg price per kWh of cents As discussed with Heather please note that EESI must file all new prod uct labels with the MPUC See WCMR D The Rules are silent as to the timing of this filing and it is unclear whether the filing must b e made prior to or concurrently with the distribution of the new label to c ustomers Please let me know if you would like us to seek clarification on this point Customer Authorization Statement The Rules regarding the content of the customer authorization statement are identical to the MA Rules and as such we have modeled the ME form after MA The only change is the correction of the rule referenced in the openin g sentence of the letter Although as we may have discussed the referenc e to such rule is not a requirement and is therefore probably not essential in either the MA or ME forms weve left the reference in for uniformitys sake If you have any questions about the attached or would like to discuss furth er please
