any thought of service arrangementassignment for those em ployees who are close on green cards They could remain Enron employees b ut perform services for Netco via an assignment letter Perhaps the

possibility if Neil d oesnt have it in hand Hope all is well Michelle Original Message From Oxley David Sent Sun PM To Curless Amanda Davies Neil Cashion Tana Slone Jeanie Cash Mich elle Fitzpatrick Amy Cc Subject RE I am concerned about Networks and NETCO I suggest we talk first Call me on the following cell phone The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown but in days we will have everything nailed down Additionally people it would appear seem to be making certain assumptions about the e state which I believe are false I cant see the estate continuing to spons or green cards or in maintaining the cash balance plan at least in the fo rm of the past etc etc Bankruptcy isnt pleasant I would however like to avoid selling NETCO at the estates expense as di fficult as this may be The main points we need to communicate and build around would be Salary Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels Job responsibility This is entirely Jay and Jennys call If they see a p erson as necessary to do a different job they need to explain that Typica lly people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the curr ent have that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them Clearly NE TCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite th e same prominence it enjoyed with Enron prebankruptcy Unfortunately that is lost forever Bonus Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enr ons current arrangement if we perform Retention Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the people in NETCO who didnt get anything in Nov This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a com mitment for them to stay for months or so otherwise they will have to rep ay it Benefits These will differ depending on who buys us However it each cas e they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different On the sp ecific point of pension plan they have plans that require some vesting per iod but again the main counter parties have agreed that they will take En ron service into account ie if they have years with Enron and their pl an requires years service to vest they will vest immediately but obvious ly will get just their first years contribution Now is someone is years in with Enron I recognise this is not a great answer but has to be contr asted with how long there is a position in the estate for them ie is the re a job for another months The last point concentrates too much on ne gative aspects of what may happen to estate so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here VISAs we have a plan to switch all Hb visas within hours This is a pparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed l ogistics with one of the counterparties in some detail On Ls these wil l take up to weeks to switch to Hs Of the people identified who hav e VISAs only about or have Ls Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the cou nterparties who have agreed our approach These people should avoid travel ing outside US in this weeks but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit Green Cards No easy solution Essentially these will have to start from s cratch The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they wil l support new applications However bear in mind I do not believe the Enro n estate will continue with green cards although this has not been officia lly proclaimed Expat Terms These will probably be honored by the new company although e ach counterparty has indicated a desire to normalise the terms with thos e of their own company over time Employment Agreements We have identified across NETCO The estate pla ns to transfer these to the buyer but it is clear that each prospective bu yer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan w ill supercede all previous terms including employment agreements that indi viduals may have had Specifically I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity cash retention target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts Clearly there may be some negotiation her e Now we have other things like Titles PRC Promotion dates Salary review s project bonuses All employee stock option programs etc to figure out but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises after al l the new employer will be probably one of the biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last years There may even be an ability to transfer after a while to a different part of their organisation if they have an internal postin g process As to process from here we want to identify those who DONT want to go and why I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an offer to switch and NOT accepti ng it As I mention above many of the terms of the offer are unlikely to be a huge surprise and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch t hem out now for someone who does want to go We should have acceptance not because of bullying or ultimatums but because we figure out early wh o had concerns solving them or switching them out for someone else JeanieAmyMichelleNeil looks like we need new updated talking points fo r all Lets get them out Weds David Original Message From Curless Amanda Sent Sunday December PM To Oxley David Davies Neil Cashion Tana Slone Jeanie Subject RE I am getting heat from IT Importance High David I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zh iyong Wei two senior IT guys had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldnt be better to stay on the Estate My whole purpose in discus sing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings However it seems that some of this miscommunication was and has become an exager ration I attended Beth Perlmans floor meeting when she communciated the differenc e between the Estate and Netco She said that Jay Webb would be talking wit h everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be ta lking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate She did te ll the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a prob lem with this then they should talk with her and HR She also said upon dea l closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation She urged them to please talk with us no w if there are any concerns She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries to bridge service and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure In addition she communicated that we have limited informa tion but we would update the group when more became available It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas etc I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is th at we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until dea l closure I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital a nd will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are they are not guranteed same benefits salary bonus etc and they fe el like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and they are on visas and in the green card process and dont want to start the process over because they dont have enough time left on their visa I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with s ome options I have talked with the concerned employees about what we reque sted but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to corre ct this miscommunication Please keep me updated if you hear anything else Thanks Mandy Original Message From Oxley David Sent Fri PM To Davies Neil Cashion Tana Slone Jeanie Curless Amanda Cc Subject I am getting heat from IT Essentially I am guessing that what we asked them to communicate re NET CO and what they did may be two rather different things While the mil es I counted them it broke up boredom of drive between me picking up vo icemails here and what is actually transpiring it sounds like we a miscom munication mess in IT People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told they had no choice but to go and if they didnt they would lose there visa etc etc This was not our intention clearly We I thought made it clear that we wo uld initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate bu t wed like to talk with them about why If its VISAs we have that nailed they shouldnt be concerned If its getting offered a lower paid job t hat simply isnt in the plans of the NETCO transaction unless Beth Jay an d Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction cant think why they would Bottomline people will transfer to a SOLVENT Aplus credit rated company on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to The benefits will switch but we already know that counter parties ben efits are fairly generous even by our standards and they will agree to bri dge service for vesting in pension et al Bonus plan should be very good c urrent proposals are slightly better than Enrons Titles promotions sto ck awards and base pay raises we arent sure about just yet but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherw ise On retention we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those p eople who didnt receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for th is to be paid to employees in the form of a cash retentionbonus payment on or as soon after deal closure as we can As you guys know these dollars approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if Enron was solvent Help me manage this please David
