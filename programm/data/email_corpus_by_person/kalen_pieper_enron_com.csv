Meredith Stewart Gray St Apt Houston TX RE PLANETFEEDBACK REFERENCE NUMBER Dear Mr Skilling Id like to bring your attention to a complaint I have with your companys overall experience I know you appreciate your customers and want to keep them happy so I am certain youll want to address this quickly This incident has infuriated me Heres the problem How DARE you treat your former employees the way you have in the last three weeks To throw employees who have devoted their lives to make your company great out on the street with no severance and trying to get out of the WARN act is a disgrace We were told to wait out the bankrupty and you would be petitioning the court for a severence in addition to the measly we received Its been like pulling teeth to get information about our termination date unemployment insurance and all of our unanswered questions And to top it all off you gave YOURSELVES million dollars in BONUSES Meanwhile there are former employees out there that have lost their entire retirement kids who arent getting a Christmas this year and families having to sell their homes How do you sleep at night My situation isnt as bad as some but I got screwed nonetheless With only a year of experience all at Enron Im having an EXTREMELY hard time competing with the talented Enron exes I have a wedding in six months student loans a car note credit card debt and I was FOUR DAYS AWAY from closing on a new house that I cant get anymore because I dont have a job Frivilous maybe but I dont know what Im supposed to do now with no benefits and desperately trying to fight depression which doesnt make this any easier I hope the bankruptcy court Heres what Id like to see happen Just pay all the employees youve laid off since November the severance you kept telling us we would get That and any outstanding monies that the didnt cover this includes payment for our unused vacation time We will NOT let you get away with this My overall experiences with your company have been extremely negative This incident has discouraged me I definitely wont recommend you to any of my family or friends Again I am sure you are interested in satisfying your customers so I hope youll
