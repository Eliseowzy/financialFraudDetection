we had responded only to an RFQ not an RFP so the issuance of the award based only on an RFQ was unusual perhaps due to urgency of program As the RFQ didnt include any terms and conditions after the award we started negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract We have been hung up on consequential damages and indemnities so on March I prepared a miniTAF covering these issues for executive approval George Hernandez assistant picked up the miniTAF on March I havent seen it since and so I dont know whether the miniTAF was fully signed or not George is out of the office and I have just

Phone Fax PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PM GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES STATE AGREEMENTS TO SPUR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced that the California Energy Commission has signed grants and contracts totaling almost million to install energy smart technology in commercial and industrial buildings throughout the state Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most and beyond Governor Davis said With these grants in place California will continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand responsive building systems technology Demand responsive building systems work by using software that automatically dim lights reduce air conditioning use and cut other electrical loads They operate in response to signals from the Independent System Operator ISO or from an electric utility or service provider Under the agreements commercial electricity customers will agree to shave peak loads by to percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their buildings in real time In addition to these grants the Governor also announced that an additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to the KMart Corporation KMart will use a million grant to replace old lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its California stores The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables program covering the KMart grant are parts of AB which was passed last year The bill is designed to reduce at least megawatts of peak load by June The Governor has proposed an additional million in his New Demand Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional megawatts in savings from demand responsive building systems

Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas

Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas

Subject Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partner ship in Response to the Western Energy Crisis Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis March Washington DC Senators Dianne Feinstein DCA and Gordon Smith ROR today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC to impose a temporary just and reasonable wholesale rate cap or costofservice based rates The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pas s on the cost of the electricity to retail customers However the states wou ld be able to determine how and when this would be done In other words California could choose to use tieredpricing realtime pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energ y costs Senator Feinstein said FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be u njust and unreasonable This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding the agency will carry out its regulatory role This i s a million a year agency It is there to regulate the energy marketplac e and it should What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis Unfortunately FERC has refus ed to do so Californias broken electricity market is a result of a flawed California law that deregulated wholesale costs but left in place caps on retail prices This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities dives t themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity o n the spot market where prices have escalated dramatically In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario so that today California buys electricity at astronomical prices We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace Additionally this agreement addresses the escalation of natural gas transportation costs Last February FERC began a twoyear experiment to li ft the cap on these costs and since that time we have seen the price of natura l gas climb percent higher in Southern California Senator Feinstein added Specifically the compromise legislation would accomplish the following goa ls Directs FERC to impose a just and reasonable wholesale rate cap which can be loaddifferentiated based on supply and demand or costofservicebased rates in the Western energy market Western Systems Coordinating Council including Arizona California Colorado Idaho Montana Nevada New Mexico Oregon Utah Washington and Wyoming Addresses the issue of high natural gas transmission costs by reimposing FE RC tariffs for natural gas transportation into California FERC Order and requiring natural gas sellers to declare separately the transportation and commodity components of the bundled rate for gray market transactions Stipulates that the wholesale price cap

<29284859.1075846138688.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and go through my thoughts with you Thanks JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Fiona CT Philip CT Subject Re Assignment of

competition Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on PM From Margo NRON on AM To Richard ES James D ES cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas I dont know if you have seen this article but perhaps it can help provide some ammunition regarding the benefits of restructuring Forwarded by Margo ReynaNAEnron on AM on AM Please respond to To cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas The Energy Report c Copyright Pasha Publications Inc All Rights Reserved The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts However some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision Last week Pennsylvania Gov Tom Ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state billion by and increase productivity employment and personal income by His comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government The report prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways By as a direct result of electric competition the report says The real gross state product will be billion or higher than the baseline Overall employment will increase by amounting to fulltime and parttime jobs including more than manufacturing jobs nearly retailsector jobs more than construction jobs nearly transportation and public utility jobs and more than servicesector jobs Nominal personal income will increase by billion or The price index will decrease by and The population will increase by persons or as workers move to the state Pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians Ridge said And according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come We expect electric competition will help create more than jobs between and and have a major positive impact on our states economy And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy Secretary of Revenue Robert Judge said Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric competition Judge said The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly billion by January due to electric competition The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue The restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says Under the law the Revenue Department must report to governor and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period The revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says As required by the law the Revenue Department will produce two more reports for the General Assembly and the Governor one in August and one in August Like Pennsylvania some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of million through rate reductions Even though the Ontario Energy Board OEB is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities Toronto HydroElectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market Since rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims We agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said As a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years Our rates are below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since Thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector Weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has implemented since price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the OEB act the testimony says Protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market Peberdy said Now is the time to look forward not back Were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro and we are prepared to work with the OEB to develop options that will help sustain the governments vision Folder Name Electric Restructuring Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit Dow Jones CustomClips or

and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

<3449193.1075846147451.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and go through my thoughts with you Thanks JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Fiona CT Philip CT Subject Re Assignment of

regulatory issues seem to be countryenvironment specific and instead I have given you the names of each person with country responsibility Indee d at yearend we completed a financial transaction Project Margaux in whic h regulatory risk was reviewed A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be helpful eg in most of these markets trading arrangements are being rewritten or developed for the first time this put existing PPAs under pressure Would energy taxes carbon taxestrading transmission pricing both for evacuation of power and delivery of gas changes in property taxfuel tax regimes risk of price regulation all be included Do you ha ve checklist We can identify these risks what is meant by manage We wor k on these types of issues on a daily basis so I am unclear as to what else is intended or implied thanks mcs James D ES To Richard ES Mark CT cc Steven J ES Subject Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Rick Mark One of the first steps in building our

related to the Transmission buyout Looks like they view it as very favorable not a major hit against EPS tied to full recovery of remaining undercollection Not sure yet if they incorporate the going forward maybe SCE doesnt want any merchant obligations Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM Kathryn Corbally PM To James D nron cc Subject CaliforniA Jim Have sent you three notes that show some level of support to activity in California its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say quote the devil is in the details and quote the odds of bankruptcty remain in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests of California consumers By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Survivor Electric Competition PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Survivor Electric Competition With rolling blackouts plunging the Golden State into darkness California has reached the point of being voted off the electricity policy island Wil l other states soon follow Californias footprints in the sand to a collap sed electricity system And how does Pennsylvanias approach to surviving electricity restructuring compare to Californias In electricity policy California and Pennsylvania have one thing in common in they both passed state statutes that were advertised as the me ans of ending electricity generation retail monopolies and reducing electrici ty prices for consumers Yet thats where the similarity ends Pennsylvania believes that the electricity market cannot be competitive unless both the wholesale and retail electricity segments of the market are competitive The supply of electricity is largely a function of the wholesale market and demand a function of the retail market For the electricity market to be optimally efficient supply and demand must respo nd to competitive price signals by the end of the transition period Consequently Pennsylvania has focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

Market Regional Plans Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item ISO Systems Procedures At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today there was considerable discussion on how this Task Force which was formed before the OASIS ANOPR was posted would coordinate on an industrywide basis a NERC response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR Here are some important points a FERC Staff member Marv Rosenberg made at the meeting These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal and the process of getting buyin in each of the RegionsRTOs FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order together with new OASIS II requirements Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals However a diversity of filings will indicate nonconsensus and FERC will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices standards for issuing in a NOPR FERC is looking for more functionality and to be more userfriendly electronic scheduling electronic reservations reduce duplication of information entry for customers not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications I asked Marv to clarify this He explained that although not required FERC welcomes propsals to address the control area sourcesink issues as part of an OASIS II solution ie Entergy SourceSink Order OASIS II should continue use of Web browsers use templates for file transfers uploads and downloads all displays do not have to look the same but encourages a common look and feel within a RTO business practicese may differ but between RTOs the practices must be standardized We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buyin an important element of our proposal If FERC adopts the NERC filing we will likely be stuck with the exisiting contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC is not proposing any tariff changes Also we will not get the control area sourcesink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in months Of course another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task Force James D ES PM To Jeff ES Janine ES

set an outline for the Regional Plans The key idea is that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and what issues need to be addressed Dont be shy about adding other topics and issues We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the commercial people I dont expect this to be easy but I think that it will be helpful I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure This would entail developing four things a tariff ISO Systems Procedures Day Ahead PX Energy Market Transmission Flowgate PX Market These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using off the shelf material I know that Tom Delaney has already started working on a tariff I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point On the ISO maybe we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope Work Plan and fees on setting up an ISO including

competition Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on PM From Margo NRON on AM To Richard ES James D ES cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas I dont know if you have seen this article but perhaps it can help provide some ammunition regarding the benefits of restructuring Forwarded by Margo ReynaNAEnron on AM on AM Please respond to To cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas The Energy Report c Copyright Pasha Publications Inc All Rights Reserved The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts However some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision Last week Pennsylvania Gov Tom Ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state billion by and increase productivity employment and personal income by His comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government The report prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways By as a direct result of electric competition the report says The real gross state product will be billion or higher than the baseline Overall employment will increase by amounting to fulltime and parttime jobs including more than manufacturing jobs nearly retailsector jobs more than construction jobs nearly transportation and public utility jobs and more than servicesector jobs Nominal personal income will increase by billion or The price index will decrease by and The population will increase by persons or as workers move to the state Pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians Ridge said And according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come We expect electric competition will help create more than jobs between and and have a major positive impact on our states economy And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy Secretary of Revenue Robert Judge said Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric competition Judge said The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly billion by January due to electric competition The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue The restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says Under the law the Revenue Department must report to governor and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period The revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says As required by the law the Revenue Department will produce two more reports for the General Assembly and the Governor one in August and one in August Like Pennsylvania some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of million through rate reductions Even though the Ontario Energy Board OEB is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities Toronto HydroElectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market Since rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims We agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said As a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years Our rates are below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since Thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector Weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has implemented since price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the OEB act the testimony says Protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market Peberdy said Now is the time to look forward not back Were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro and we are prepared to work with

Market Regional Plans Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item ISO Systems Procedures At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today there was considerable discussion on how this Task Force which was formed before the OASIS ANOPR was posted would coordinate on an industrywide basis a NERC response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR Here are some important points a FERC Staff member Marv Rosenberg made at the meeting These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal and the process of getting buyin in each of the RegionsRTOs FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order together with new OASIS II requirements Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals However a diversity of filings will indicate nonconsensus and FERC will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices standards for issuing in a NOPR FERC is looking for more functionality and to be more userfriendly electronic scheduling electronic reservations reduce duplication of information entry for customers not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications I asked Marv to clarify this He explained that although not required FERC welcomes propsals to address the control area sourcesink issues as part of an OASIS II solution ie Entergy SourceSink Order OASIS II should continue use of Web browsers use templates for file transfers uploads and downloads all displays do not have to look the same but encourages a common look and feel within a RTO business practicese may differ but between RTOs the practices must be standardized We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buyin an important element of our proposal If FERC adopts the NERC filing we will likely be stuck with the exisiting contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC is not proposing any tariff changes Also we will not get the control area sourcesink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in months Of course another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task Force James D ES PM To Jeff ES Janine ES

Plans I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today I think that the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for transmission pricing and energy markets To

process B MOVING FORWARD Top Issues upcoming External Factors eg will Entergy join SPP Resource Needs Relationship to Commercial Objectives Business Plans C OTHER ISSUES CONCLUSION I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans The key idea is that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and what issues need to be addressed Dont be shy about adding other topics and issues We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the commercial people I dont expect this to be easy but I think that it will be helpful I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure This would entail developing four things a tariff ISO Systems Procedures Day Ahead PX Energy Market Transmission Flowgate PX Market These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using off the shelf material I know that Tom Delaney has already started working on a tariff I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point On the ISO maybe we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope Work Plan and fees on setting up an ISO including

<7519117.1075846262491.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to

some level of support to activity in California its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say quote the devil is in the details and quote the odds of bankruptcty remain in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the

respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Survivor Electric Competition PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Survivor Electric Competition With rolling blackouts plunging the Golden State into darkness California has reached the point of being voted off the electricity policy island Wil l other states soon follow Californias footprints in the sand to a collap sed electricity system And how does Pennsylvanias approach to surviving electricity restructuring compare to Californias In electricity policy California and Pennsylvania have one thing in common in they both passed state statutes that were advertised as the me ans of ending electricity generation retail monopolies and reducing electrici ty prices for consumers Yet thats where the similarity ends Pennsylvania believes that the electricity market cannot be competitive unless both the wholesale and retail electricity segments of the market are competitive The supply of electricity is largely a function of the wholesale market and demand a function of the retail market For the electricity market to be optimally efficient supply and demand must respo nd to competitive price signals by the end of the transition period Consequently Pennsylvania has focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access

<27613588.1075851028610.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and go through my thoughts with you Thanks JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Fiona CT Philip CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Jim overnight I realised you need to add our project in Turkey Fiona Grant and Poland Philip Davies I have not given you any one person as the regulatory issues seem to be countryenvironment specific and instead I have given you the names of each person with country responsibility Indee d at yearend we completed a financial transaction Project Margaux in whic h regulatory risk was reviewed A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be helpful eg in most of these markets trading arrangements are being rewritten or developed for the first time this put existing PPAs under pressure Would energy taxes carbon taxestrading transmission pricing both for evacuation of power and delivery of gas changes in property taxfuel tax regimes risk of price regulation all be included Do you ha ve checklist We can identify these risks what is meant by manage We wor k on these types of issues on a daily basis so I am unclear as to what else is intended or implied thanks mcs James D ES To Richard ES Mark CT cc Steven J ES Subject Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Rick Mark One of the first steps in building our

focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas The Energy Report c Copyright Pasha Publications Inc All Rights Reserved The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts However some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision Last week Pennsylvania Gov Tom Ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state billion by and increase productivity employment and personal income by His comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government The report prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways By as a direct result of electric competition the report says The real gross state product will be billion or higher than the baseline Overall employment will increase by amounting to fulltime and parttime jobs including more than manufacturing jobs nearly retailsector jobs more than construction jobs nearly transportation and public utility jobs and more than servicesector jobs Nominal personal income will increase by billion or The price index will decrease by and The population will increase by persons or as workers move to the state Pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians Ridge said And according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come We expect electric competition will help create more than jobs between and and have a major positive impact on our states economy And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy Secretary of Revenue Robert Judge said Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric competition Judge said The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly billion by January due to electric competition The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue The restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says Under the law the Revenue Department must report to governor and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period The revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says As required by the law the Revenue Department will produce two more reports for the General Assembly and the Governor one in August and one in August Like Pennsylvania some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of million through rate reductions Even though the Ontario Energy Board OEB is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities Toronto HydroElectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market Since rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims We agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said As a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years Our rates are below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since Thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector Weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has implemented since price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the OEB act the testimony says Protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market Peberdy said Now is the time to look forward not back Were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro and we are prepared to work with

<11500035.1075846278604.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and go through my thoughts with you Thanks JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Fiona CT Philip CT Subject Re Assignment of

Project Margaux in whic h regulatory risk was reviewed A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be helpful eg in most of these markets trading arrangements are being rewritten or developed for the first time this put existing PPAs under pressure Would energy taxes carbon taxestrading transmission pricing both for evacuation of power and delivery of gas changes in property taxfuel tax regimes risk of

and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Survivor Electric Competition PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Survivor Electric Competition With rolling blackouts plunging the Golden State into darkness California has reached the point of being voted off the electricity policy island Wil l other states soon follow Californias footprints in the sand to a collap sed electricity system And how does Pennsylvanias approach to surviving electricity restructuring compare to Californias In electricity policy California and Pennsylvania have one thing in common in they both passed state statutes that were advertised as the me ans of ending electricity generation retail monopolies and reducing electrici ty prices for consumers Yet thats where the similarity ends Pennsylvania believes that the electricity market cannot be competitive unless both the wholesale and retail electricity segments of the market are competitive The supply of electricity is largely a function of the wholesale market and demand a function of the retail market For the electricity market to be optimally efficient supply and demand must respo nd to competitive price signals by the end of the transition period Consequently Pennsylvania has focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

HartsoeCorpEnron Ron ES Steve ES Dan ES Robin ES Sarah NovoselCorpEnron Kerry ES Christi L ES Steve ES Tom DelaneyCorpEnron Howard ES Daniel ES Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Transmission Wholesale Market Regional Plans Jim a BIG external factor that is directed to the item ISO Systems Procedures At the NERC Electronic Scheduling Task Force meeting today there was considerable discussion on how this Task Force which was formed before the OASIS ANOPR was posted would coordinate on an industrywide basis a NERC response to the OASIS Phase II ANOPR Here are some important points a FERC Staff member Marv Rosenberg made at the meeting These should be kept in mind in developing the Enron proposal and the process of getting buyin in each of the RegionsRTOs FERC prefers a single industry consensus filing The ANOPR is intended to tie RTO Order together with new OASIS II requirements Does not preclude individual RTOs or entities from submitting proposals However a diversity of filings will indicate nonconsensus and FERC will make its own decisions which will likely not be industry friendly FERC is asking the industry for communication and Business Practices standards for issuing in a NOPR FERC is looking for more functionality and to be more userfriendly electronic scheduling electronic reservations reduce duplication of information entry for customers not intended to dictate the Control Area to Control Area communications I asked Marv to clarify this He explained that although not required FERC welcomes propsals to address the control area sourcesink issues as part of an OASIS II solution ie Entergy SourceSink Order OASIS II should continue use of Web browsers use templates for file transfers uploads and downloads all displays do not have to look the same but encourages a common look and feel within a RTO business practicese may differ but between RTOs the practices must be standardized We need to keep close to the NERC efforts since FERC has historically tended to favor NERC proposals because they tout an air of industry consensus The clarificaton to the ANOPR given by Marv should make buyin an important element of our proposal If FERC adopts the NERC filing we will likely be stuck with the exisiting contract path seams problems and LMP fragmentation in the East because NERC is not proposing any tariff changes Also we will not get the control area sourcesink issue resolved since it will be impossible to resolve at NERC in months Of course another option would be to incorporate our efforts with this Task Force James D ES PM To Jeff ES Janine ES Charles CT Joe NRON Ron ES Steve ES Dan CT Robin ES Sarah NRON Kerry ES Christi L CT Steve CT Tom NRON Howard ES Daniel ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Transmission Wholesale Market Regional Plans I appreciate everyone who participated in the call today I think that the discussion proved that we can find consensus on a reasonable approach for transmission pricing and energy markets To make more clear about the Regional Plans I think that we need to consider the following A BACKGROUND Timelines of Current Process Current Players Current Positions Allies Key Issues now facing the process B MOVING FORWARD Top Issues upcoming External Factors eg will Entergy join SPP Resource Needs Relationship to Commercial Objectives Business Plans C OTHER ISSUES CONCLUSION I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans The key idea is that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and what issues need to be addressed Dont be shy about adding other topics and issues We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the commercial people I dont expect this to be easy but I think that it will be helpful I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure This would entail developing four things a tariff ISO Systems Procedures Day Ahead PX Energy Market Transmission Flowgate PX Market These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using off the shelf material I know that Tom Delaney has already started working on a tariff I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point On the ISO maybe we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope Work Plan and fees on setting up an ISO including costs of operation over time It would make sense to me to do this very formally including setting energy market zones and defining the commercially significant Flowgates I would use the MISO as the

some level of support to activity in California its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say quote the devil is in the details and quote the odds of bankruptcty remain in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

Plan Nice final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests of California consumers By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Survivor Electric Competition PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Survivor Electric Competition With rolling blackouts plunging the Golden State into darkness California has reached the point of being voted off the electricity policy island Wil l other states soon follow Californias footprints in the sand to a collap sed electricity system And how does Pennsylvanias approach to surviving electricity restructuring compare to Californias In electricity policy California and Pennsylvania have one thing in common in they both passed state statutes that were advertised as the me ans of ending electricity generation retail monopolies and reducing electrici ty prices for consumers Yet thats where the similarity ends Pennsylvania believes that the electricity market cannot be competitive unless both the wholesale and retail electricity segments of the market are competitive The supply of electricity is largely a function of the wholesale market and demand a function of the retail market For the electricity market to be optimally efficient supply and demand must respo nd to competitive price signals by the end of the transition period Consequently Pennsylvania has focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Survivor Electric Competition PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market January Vol No Survivor Electric Competition With rolling blackouts plunging the Golden State into darkness California has reached the point of being voted off the electricity policy island Wil l other states soon follow Californias footprints in the sand to a collap sed electricity system And how does Pennsylvanias approach to surviving electricity restructuring compare to Californias In electricity policy California and Pennsylvania have one thing in common in they both passed state statutes that were advertised as the me ans of ending electricity generation retail monopolies and reducing electrici ty prices for consumers Yet thats where the similarity ends Pennsylvania believes that the electricity market cannot be competitive unless both the wholesale and retail electricity segments of the market are competitive The supply of electricity is largely a function of the wholesale market and demand a function of the retail market For the electricity market to be optimally efficient supply and demand must respo nd to competitive price signals by the end of the transition period Consequently Pennsylvania has focused on retail market structure and push es for competitive wholesale market policies like the expansion of the wholesale market known as PJM On the other hand retail competition was always the sizzle but never the steak in California policymaking Now being scrapped and replaced by something that will again raid consumers wallets Californias appr oach assumed that a successful result would occur if competition were introduce d only into the wholesale market as long as utilities passed this price through to their still captive retail customers In that assumption p lus the desire to pay its utilities billion of stranded costs on an accelerated schedule lies the root of Californias disaster Explo ding demand and the failure of the federal government to end the balkanization of the nations wholesale electric markets have also played a role in aggravating the outcome but have not caused it as is proven by the continued successful operation of Californias generationowning munici pal utilities Although the chosen paths of Pennsylvania and California have landed them in very different places on the road to surviving and succeeding in electric competition the games not over and Pennsylvania still faces challenges ahead But with the exception of GPU that now suffers from unwise or unluc ky decisions Pennsylvania consumers and utilities are not only surviving but also benefiting from electric competition Hows Pennsylvania Doing To date Pennsylvanias consumers have saved billion since Januar y and consumers have switched to a competitive supplier That total will surpass by April as a result of the recent successful auction of competitive default supply in the PECO Energy service territory which will enable New Power to serve another customers and Green Mountain an additional This auction wouldnt have succeeded wit hout the commitment of PECO Energy and without the high residential shopping credit of cents per kilowatthour Licensed competitors now supply about of the electricity consumed by Pennsylvanias families and businesses So far by switching many shopping customers have saved to off their total electric bills and have been able to contract for electricity for a year or longer Competitive retail offers are well below typically to cents per kilowatthours what residential consumers were paying utilities for generation prior to competition or the utilities embedd ed generation rate In addition most shopping and nonshopping customers hav e enjoyed guaranteed total rate cuts of to and rates for customers of Duquesne Light will be slashed by about in Renewable and cleaner energy products are available for the first time in the states history and customers have purchased them The first two wind farms in Pennsylvania are operational and several more are likely to b e built in The Commonwealth can realistically act to attract megawatts of additional new wind generation by The budgets for Pennsylvanias substantial LowIncome Usage Reduction Program and for its national leading Customer Assistance Programs which reduce rates by as much as for lowincome families have been quadrupled In fact approximately lowincome families in the PECO Energy service territory alone have received these sharply lower rates Beyond this impressive record of accomplishment rates are capped at Janua ry levels until at least and at slightly higher levels until in most service territories The jump in natural gas and oil home heating bills by as much as this winter underscores the tremendous value of the rate cap to consumers Unlike those energy sources the retail price of electricity hasnt increased at all Indeed the electric rate cap alon e has probably saved electricity consumers hundreds of millions of dollars just in the last year and made electricity the only energy bargain in this winter of gas and oil price spikes The Pennsylvania and California Experience As Different as Richard and Ru dy Pennsylvania embarked on its competitive retail journey by running a large pilot program from November through December as required by the state electric competition statute In the pilot over customers of the entire states load switched to a competitive supplier The total number of customers that switched in California almost never exceede d the number that did so just during Pennsylvanias pilot program The pilot revealed that consumers want to shop for electricity as more th an customers asked for permission to shop and would do so if stranded costs were not paid to utilities in a manner that destroyed the retail competitive market Just as importantly the large pilot project proved tha t many companies would enter the retail market to serve all customer classes as long as stranded cost recovery mechanisms didnt make entry impossib le Of course whether stranded cost recovery mechanisms kill retail competiti on depends on the size of what is variously called the shopping credit the price to compare or the default rate These are terms for the amount in cents per kilowatthour that a switching customer no longer pays for generation service to the local utility once the customer takes his busine ss to a competitor California set this amount at absurdly low levels and linked it to the wholesale price By doing so California killed retail competition and delivered San Diegos customers into the tender mercies of the local utility a deregulated monopoly that offered a spot market electricit y product By contrast Pennsylvania recognized that in a truly free market a shoppi ng customer should not pay anything to the utility for electricity no longer purchased Pennsylvania also recognized that its decision to allow utiliti es to recover of their documented stranded costs required consumers to continue to pay some amount for some transition period for the electricity they were no longer buying from the utility Pennsylvania responded by tryi ng to make sure that the amount of stranded cost recovery did not eviscerate the consumers shopping credit Pennsylvania understood that what was l eft of the consumers shopping credit after stranded cost payments were considered had to be sufficiently greater than the prices they would see i n the market so that they could save money by shopping and so that competitive suppliers would enter the market to serve them Pennsylvania shopping credits are typically to higher than those in California but still well below every utilitys embedded generation rat e Retail competition has worked best for consumers in those parts of Pennsylvania where the shopping credits are highest In those service territories principally Duquesne Light and PECO Energy huge numbers of residential and other customers have switched suppliers and realized savin gs andor purchased cleaner energy products Lessons Learned The lesson is clear retail competition wont work unless shopping cred its are set as close as possible to a utilitys embedded generation rate g iven the amount of stranded cost recovery allowed For retail competition to be genuine the shopping credit must equal the utilitys embedded generati on rate if no stranded costs are recovered or once recovery is complete Yet protecting consumers shopping credits is not the only necessary condition for a competitive market Other conditions that must be met are a liquid workably competitive wholesale market that includes future contract s as well as spot price trading and the empowerment of customers through timeofuse meters and appliance control technologies to change their dema nd and profit from doing so Other Differences From its pilot experience a unique Pennsylvania restructuring model emerg ed that has five major differences from Californias policies in addition to the shopping credit length of transition periods divestiture of generati on assets reliance on spot markets and requirements to sell and buy from spo t markets size and administration of wholesale markets and entry of new supply Transition Pennsylvanias transition periods are longer running from at least eig ht to as many as years to This longer transition period gives ti me to correct infirmities in the nations wholesale markets reduces the p er kilowatthour stranded cost charge and price distortion by spreading stranded costs over more years and time to create a true demandside response that can police the wholesale market Divestiture and spot markets Pennsylvania allowed but didnt require utilities to divest generation assets and two have done so Pennsylvania didnt require utilities to sell all power into and buy all power from a newly created wholesale spot marke t Pennsylvania utilities are free to use longterm contracts and any hedging instruments that they deem appropriate The combination of these policies have made utilities and their customers less dependent upon the volatile spot market than those in California Size and administration of markets Prior to twothirds of Pennsylvania was part of the largest electricity free trade zone in America the megawatt wholesale market governed by the PJM independent system operator which stretches fr om Virginia to Northern New Jersey and includes Maryland Delaware NJ and Washington DC Unlike the California ISO and Power Exchange PX that were rushed into operation in PJM was founded in and has been steadi ly transformed from an entity that once served only member utilities into a separate corporation with a board that is completely independent of market participants The PJM board has the legal duty of ensuring that the wholesale market is genuinely competitive and reliable Moreover unlike the California ISO and PX that serves only portions of California PJM is a multistate regional market It also borders the New York Independent System Operator and is near to the New England System Operator PJM NYISO and New England ISO benefit from their close proximi ty and a common wholesale market price cap In fact independent system operators administer wholesale markets all the way from Maine to Northern Virginia Nowhere else in America over such a large connected geographic area are the trading rules and operations of the power grid no longer controlled directly by local electric monopolies New supply About megawatts of new supply were added to PJMs wholesale market in megawatts will be added in and megawatts in according to PJM officials This substantial amount of new supply should preserve reliability and prevent shortages Staying On Track Although Pennsylvania has a successful four years of transition to generation competition behind it and has delivered many benefits the process could still go off track To avoid pitfalls five things must occu r First PJM must be expanded to the service territories of Allegheny Energy and Duquesne Light and in fact negotiations are underway for these two utilities to create PJMWest FirstEnergy must also be required to join PJ M as a condition of its merger with GPU Additionally within five years onl y one Independent System Operator should operate from Northern Virginia to Maine Its time to seriously think about one of those famous merge rs of equals for the three independent system operators on the East Coast Expansion of PJM will create a bigger wholesale market and a bigger marke t should be more competitive transparent and stable Second customers must be given the ability to change their demand in response to price in real times As a result customers must have timeofuse meters and control devices installed on appliances like air conditioners and water heaters Utilities should be required to install th is equipment over the next five to years Only with this equipment can customers gain financial incentives for changing demand Ensuring that demand responds more directly to price is critical to limiting wholesale market prices to preserving reliability and to reducing environmental an d public health problems caused by the production and consumption of electricity PJM calculates that a reduction in peak demand causes a reduction in peak price In addition energy efficiency should be pursued before a crisis hits Available consumer education money should be used to increase the market penetration of fluorescent light bulbs programmable thermostats and other energysaving devices Third Pennsylvania should monitor additions to supply and attract at least megawatts of new wind generation Fourth the budget for the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA should be substantially increased to allow it to monitor and research the operation o f the wholesale market in order to guard against abusive market power OCA must have the ability to know as much as market participants about outage rates withholding of power imports exports and so on A beefed up OCA would be the best deterrent to some business practices that ultimately wou ld destroy public confidence in competitive markets Fifth distributed generation is a potentially powerful competitor to grid power The Commonwealth needs to ensure that any barriers to entry for modern clean distributed generation technologies are removed A uniform statewide law that addresses issues such as installation standards net metering rules and interconnection policies in a manner that will promote distributed generation should be enacted Together these five policies can help Pennsylvania successfully complete t he journey to surviving and succeeding in electricity competition Yet the failure to enact these policies could put at risk all that has been achieve d A successful completion of this transition is vital to our future as both the benefits achieved so far in Pennsylvania and the ongoing trouble in California make clear In Pennsylvania more consumer business and environmental benefits are n ot guaranteed but are in reach With continuing attention to detail electricity in Pennsylvania by can be cheaper cleaner and a source o f competitive advantage For other states entering or contemplating electric competition both California and Pennsylvania offer important lessons on how to stay in the game and win

final flame Hoeckers Last WordCalif Must Adopt Realistic Pwr Plan Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c Dow Jones Company Inc WASHINGTON Dow Jones California officials have shown bald disregard for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing shortsighted policies that will push the states two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday The remarks by Hoecker who resigned as chairman effective Thursday came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California Hoecker lambasted Gov Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the states power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts State officials ignored the commissions Dec marketrestructuring order and instead embraced conspiracy theories resistance to more realistic rates and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay solutions Hoecker said White Housebrokered negotiations to develop powersupply contracts as part of a nearterm solution are at an impasse due to unrealistic demands by Gov Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production Hoecker said He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at belowpresentcost pre levels Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies Edison Internationals Southern California Edison Co EIX and PGE Corps Pacific Gas Electric Co PCG will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the states flawed marketrestructuring law Hoecker said Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted If it cannot perhaps it will force debtors creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light without recrimination and posturing he said Lets be realistic Hoecker said Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait Without a reasonable technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other Hoecker called for state officials to expeditiously implement the provisions of FERCs Dec order In particular he said the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the orders provision calling for suspension of the singleprice auction when prices bid exceed per megawatthour Prices above the level allowed in the Dec order have further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities he said Reaching a deal on forward contracts as called for in FERCs order is essential Hoecker said An arbitrary bottomline solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs he said But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the states first legislative response to the crisis which Davis signed into law Thursday to replace the California Independent System Operators industryparticipant governing board with a board of political state appointees Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO a FERCjurisdictional entity represents an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power markets Hoecker said Further he said FERC made mistakes in allowing AB the states electricity restructuring law to usurp the commissions regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place Because the state is now clearly a market participant the independence of the ISO board is bound to be compromised Consequently the states decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB Hoecker said More than that this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions called for in FERCs Dec restructuring order Hoecker said I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority Hoecker rejected the states continuing call for firm price caps in the region Price caps will only jeopardize reliability mask problems temporarily and deter or destroy any chance to solve the longterm supply challenge he said Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next with no agreedupon objectives The governors stated plans are unrealistic and ours cannot be fully implemented without his help Hoecker concluded I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests of California consumers By Bryan Lee Dow Jones Newswires Copyright Dow Jones Company Inc All Rights Reserved

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

RTO Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

some level of support to activity in California its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say quote the devil is in the details and quote the odds of bankruptcty remain in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide

<18904152.1075850414699.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-02-10 00:24:00,Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets Cc thanks for the response I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi th either a specific asset eg Sutton Bridge or a trading book eg UK gas is impossible We could have people spending of their time sitting around dreaming up whatifs and still not see everything On the other hand as your team does now once we have been able to identify reasonable risks it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks On the flip side of the risk coin the process of identifying Regulatory Ri sk should also allow Govt Affairs working with our business colleagues to identify rule changes policy changes that could positively impact our bottom line For instance we could push through regulatory action for a retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin I dont disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business risks But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli cy taxes exportimport rates etc Because Enron is actively participati ng in many regulated or semiregulated environments regulatory risks are business risks Finally it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in assisting our business people in managing these risks To this end the Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of responsibilities for Govt Affairs To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris k To assess and compute value at risk for each Regulatory Risk To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk eg insurance To propose andor plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks To assign EGA andor commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati on efforts To review mitigation efforts against existing plans To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk eg BIT To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events MM To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this further Like you I dont want to create some process that provides littl e to no value JDS Mark CT AM To James D ES cc Richard ES Steven J ES Sharon CT Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s yes lets meet I will have Sharon try to put something in the diary I would suggest the hardest part is anticipating these changes here are some examples UK Climate Change Levy even other Government Departments i n the UK are not allowed to kow what is in the Budget until the Chancellor delivers it to Parliament Turkish fuel consumption tax I believe was modified without prior notice In Romania Doug Wood met with the Energy Minister on the proposed Gas Decree and days later they passed another draft of the decree which had been rejected before Christmas verbatim T om Briggs can tell you that the annual revenue formula for BG TransCo which affects all of our UK assets can swing up or down by per annum and cannot be predictedmodelled we and our consultants have tried Decision s by Polish regulator to price regulate generation in Poland notwithstanding our PPA was another example The list goes on I remain a sceptic that a ll of these risks or even many of them can be identified a priori Once w e fact them we do assessmitigate In Europe I think we accept these as business risks that the regulatory team responds to mcs James D ES To Mark CT cc Richard ES Steven J ES Subject Re Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Asset s Mark Thanks for the additions I will add to the Asset Responsibility Matrix The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of Sovereign Risk with the other element being Political Risk Regulatory Risk is a legal action taken by a government or its agent which modifies Enrons business environment most often directly through modifications in the energy and communications markets but also in broad areas such as taxe s and export import policies Political Risk is a supralegal action tha t has the same impact eg expropriation Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group Fiona Grant is member is tryi ng to put in place a standard process to review and analyze regualtory risk around the globe quite an undertaking When I use the term Regulatory Ri sk Management I am primarily talking about such a process The key elements of any risk management function are identification assessment mitigation transference and audit You would probably agree that th e most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Ri sk event The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an assigned person to manage our activities so that Enron does not face an associated loss My goal is to try an have this process in place by midyear That would include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets the reason for the original questions and the ability to review pending deals When you come over to

Project Margaux in whic h regulatory risk was reviewed A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be helpful eg in most of these markets trading arrangements are being rewritten or developed for the first

competition Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on PM From Margo NRON on AM To Richard ES James D ES cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas I dont know if you have seen this article but perhaps it can help provide some ammunition regarding the benefits of restructuring Forwarded by Margo ReynaNAEnron on AM on AM Please respond to To cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas The Energy Report c Copyright Pasha Publications Inc All Rights Reserved The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts However some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision Last week Pennsylvania Gov Tom Ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state billion by and increase productivity employment and personal income by His comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government The report prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways By as a direct result of electric competition the report says The real gross state product will be billion or higher than the baseline Overall employment will increase by amounting to fulltime and parttime jobs including more than manufacturing jobs nearly retailsector jobs more than construction jobs nearly transportation and public utility jobs and more than servicesector jobs Nominal personal income will increase by billion or The price index will decrease by and The population will increase by persons or as workers move to the state Pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians Ridge said And according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come We expect electric competition will help create more than jobs between and and have a major positive impact on our states economy And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy Secretary of Revenue Robert Judge said Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric competition Judge said The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly billion by January due to electric competition The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue The restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says Under the law the Revenue Department must report to governor and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period The revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says As required by the law the Revenue Department will produce two more reports for the General Assembly and the Governor one in August and one in August Like Pennsylvania some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of million through rate reductions Even though the Ontario Energy Board OEB is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities Toronto HydroElectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market Since rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims We agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said As a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years Our rates are below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since Thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector Weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has implemented since price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the OEB act the testimony says Protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market Peberdy said Now is the time to look forward not back Were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro and we are prepared to work with

process B MOVING FORWARD Top Issues upcoming External Factors eg will Entergy join SPP Resource Needs Relationship to Commercial Objectives Business Plans C OTHER ISSUES CONCLUSION I hope this helps set an outline for the Regional Plans The key idea is that I want to make sure everyone has a calendar of where we are going and what issues need to be addressed Dont be shy about adding other topics and issues We need to have this to communicate within our group and to the commercial people I dont expect this to be easy but I think that it will be helpful I think that we need to put more detail around the entire structure This would entail developing four things a tariff ISO Systems Procedures Day Ahead PX Energy Market Transmission Flowgate PX Market These are the four building blocks to a New Marketplace My hope is for Enron to put these things out in a detailed framework using off the shelf material I know that Tom Delaney has already started working on a tariff I think we could adapt the Cal PX model into point We could probably use the APX Flowgate System for point On the ISO maybe we could go to ESCA and have a Detailed Scope Work Plan and fees on setting up an ISO including costs of operation over time It would make sense to me to do this very formally including setting energy market zones and defining the commercially significant Flowgates I would use the MISO as the market to focus on but am willing to listen to other thoughts Please let me know what everyone thinks Jim

competition Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on PM From Margo NRON on AM To Richard ES James D ES cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas I dont know if you have seen this article but perhaps it can help provide some ammunition regarding the benefits of restructuring Forwarded by Margo ReynaNAEnron on AM on AM Please respond to To cc Subject Electric Restructuring Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas Despite bad name restructuring benefiting some areas The Energy Report c Copyright Pasha Publications Inc All Rights Reserved The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are solely the result of restructuring efforts However some areas that have deregulated dont regret the decision Last week Pennsylvania Gov Tom Ridge said that electric competition will save consumers in his state billion by and increase productivity employment and personal income by His comments came as a response to a report recently issued by the state government The report prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact of restructuring on state finances said that forecast reductions in retail electricity prices will improve the states economy in several ways By as a direct result of electric competition the report says The real gross state product will be billion or higher than the baseline Overall employment will increase by amounting to fulltime and parttime jobs including more than manufacturing jobs nearly retailsector jobs more than construction jobs nearly transportation and public utility jobs and more than servicesector jobs Nominal personal income will increase by billion or The price index will decrease by and The population will increase by persons or as workers move to the state Pennsylvanias national leadership in electric competition continues to bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians Ridge said And according to this new report those savings and benefits will continue for some time to come We expect electric competition will help create more than jobs between and and have a major positive impact on our states economy And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers continue to save money on their electric bills without even lifting a finger Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and invest creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy Secretary of Revenue Robert Judge said Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate reductions there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric competition Judge said The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly billion by January due to electric competition The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax and personal income tax revenue The restructuring law required that deregulation bring no net effect on immediate state tax collections the report says Under the law the Revenue Department must report to governor and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable lawmakers to judge the laws impact on the economy and to decide whether new laws are necessary to maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition period The revenue neutral reconciliation the adjustment mechanism used to compare tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring is working as intended the report says As required by the law the Revenue Department will produce two more reports for the General Assembly and the Governor one in August and one in August Like Pennsylvania some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive market for electricity has saved customers upwards of million through rate reductions Even though the Ontario Energy Board OEB is currently considering scaling back or stopping the move to competitive markets one of the provinces largest utilities Toronto HydroElectric says local regulators should recognize the savings from restructuring Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the utilitys commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new competitive electricity market Since rates have fallen for all customer classes the utility claims We agree wholeheartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new electricity market Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said As a municipal electric utility weve protected consumers to the tune of more than million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years Our rates are below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates since Thats why were keen for the province to stay focused on introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector Weve invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace already and were ready to go The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the savings they have produced Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to lower prices at the expense of more reliable service Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has implemented since price minimization should not outweigh other objectives in the OEB act the testimony says Protect consumers not just in terms of rates but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution services The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with competitive reform not to delay the developing market already in a transition phase because it might scare away new participants The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity market Peberdy said Now is the time to look forward not back Were excited about the potential for new investment new energy technologies and new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro and we are prepared to work with the OEB to develop options that will help sustain the governments vision Folder Name Electric Restructuring Relevance Score on Scale of To review or revise your folder visit Dow Jones CustomClips or

RTO Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope

review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

Research Bulletin Fixed Income Research Reference Number United States Mar Leo J Kelser Highlights of This Issue Governor Gray Davis of California met with a group of sellside and rating agency analysts in New York yesterday The Governor outlined his plan for restoring the utilities to financial viability so that they can meet their obligations Below we summarize a few highlights from the meeting Trying to Fit Solution Within Existing Rate Structure The Governor talked about the need to find a solution to the utilities problems within the context of their existing rate structures He indicated that the temporary rate hike from January would be made permanent and that a rate reduction that went into effect in January would be reversed in March Status of Negotiations with PGE As we noted in a February th comment the Governor has reached an agreement in principle with Southern California Edison EIX BCC to address that utilitys past undercollections He hopes to also have an agreement with PGE within the next days suggesting that progress was made in particular in the last days However the Governor acknowledged that reaching an agreement with PGE was more difficult due to its larger undercollected balance and lower rates compared with SCE Some Generators Agree to Haircut The Governor indicated that a couple of unnamed generators have voluntarily agreed to accept less than cents on the dollar for their past due receivables When pressed about which parties theyve had constructive discussions with he identified Williams WMB BaaBBB Enron ENE BaaBBB and Dynegy DYN BaaBBB We note that most of the generators and marketers with exposure to California have established reserves against possible losses Importantly the Governor said that he hoped that the banks and bondholders would not be asked to take a haircut Prospects for Legislation and Possibility of Ballot Initiative The Governor said he is quite confident that he can reach an agreement with the utilities that the legislature can support Although he admitted that he couldnt prevent someone from proposing a ballot initiative the governor said that in the end the acid test with the public is how it affects their pocket books Thus if there is ultimately a ballot initiative Governor Davis is optimistic that the public will be supportive of his plan given the limited impact on electric rates Status of Defaulted Utility Debt As we have commented in the past it appears unlikely that the resulting legislation will pass with the required majority to go into effect immediately Accordingly there will be a several month lag before the utilities receive any cash In response to a question it appears that the state will not step in to help the utilities pay off any maturing or defaulted commercial paper But the Governor and his advisers hope that legislation will provide enough certainty so that the companies can get bridge financing Essentially it appears the Governor is leaving it up to the utilities to find the money from their banks Governors Strategy to Keep the Lights On The Governor stated that a key reason that deregulation failed in California was that no new power plants were built in the state for over twelve years In the intervening time demand caught up with supply In response he has proposed various conservation initiatives and is trying to expedite the construction of new power plants He set a goal of having megawatts mws of new supply on line by In addition the governor highlighted the need for additional investment in the transmission infrastructure In particular he cited the need to expand the capacity to import more power from Arizona as well to improve the ability to move power from south to north within the state He suggested that part of the rationale for the state taking over the utilities transmission grids was to ensure that the additional investment takes place He also suggested that the state would lease the transmission lines back to the utilities to allow them to continue to operate them In the meantime the focus is to move away from Californias overreliance on the spot market In that vein Calpine CPN BaBB yesterday announced the signing of two longterm contracts with the states Department of Water Resources DWR One of those contracts was to sell up to mws over a ten year term The other was to provide up to mw of peaking capacity under a year contract Earlier in February CPN had reached agreement with the DWR on a separate year contract for an additional mws EIX WMB MLPFS was a manager of

Load exception one of our key policy questions While the answer is still many months away this is a critical decision for Enron We will keep everyone apprised of developments Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Ronald Carroll PM To cc Subject Fwd Court Weighs US Power Over Utilities Message from Tracey Bradley on Mon Feb To Deanna King Justin Long Minhtu Nguyen Nancy Pickover Subject Court Weighs US Power Over Utilities Court Weighs US Power Over Utilities February WASHINGTON Feb United Press International via COMTEX In a case that could prove pivotal for energy competition the Supreme Court said Monday it would hear argument next term on whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can regulate the transmission of electricity within a state At issue is whether FERC regulations can foster competition in the local electricity marketplace But the case also tests whether the Supreme Court will continue enhancing state power at the expense of the federal government as it has in a number of decisions in recent years And far from being a dusty exercise in legal maneuvering the case is also just one more example of how the actions of the Supreme Court can affect the average American The financial stakes are huge for the suppliers and distributors of electricity but the dispute also could have a direct influence on how much consumers pay for electricity Though California is not a party in the case the energy crisis in that state and its ramifications in neighboring states have brought concern over electric utilities to the forefront The Federal Power Act of gave the federal government the authority to regulate interstate transmission of energy but largely left an individual state in charge when it came to the energy transmission within that states borders In most electric facilities were intrastate facilities operating within a particular states borders New York told the Supreme Court in a petition In however FERC preempted state regulation of both the delivery of electricity from a generator to a retail consumer in the same state and the use of local distribution facilities to deliver electricity that is resold New York representatives said FERC envisioned the introduction of competition not only in its jurisdictional wholesale marketbut also in the state jurisdictional retail market and concluded that competition allowed it to expand its jurisdiction in three areas First FERC asserted its jurisdiction over retail transactions when states unbundled or separated retail rates into charges for delivery and electricity Second FERC decided that if a seller of unbundled wholesale energy made use of a local distribution system FERC not the states would set the rates that the seller would pay for the use of thosefacilities New York said Third FERC preempted the states authority to set rates to recoup the costs incurred by utilities to serve retail customers that may be stranded unrecoverable by utilities due to competition the state said The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit consolidated scores of challenges to the new regulations including those from nine state commissions and last June upheld all of FERCs actions Several losing parties including New York then asked the Supreme Court for a review Monday the justices combined the New York case with one brought by energy giant Enron Power Marketing and agreed to hear the case sometime next term In its own brief to the Supreme Court on behalf of FERC the Justice Department said a section of the Federal Energy Act explicitly gives FERC jurisdiction over all transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and all facilities for such transmission regardless of whether the transmission is part of a wholesale or retail transaction Besides the department argued a distinction between interstate and intrastate energy may be meaningless In a ruling FPC vs Florida Light Power the Supreme Court recognized that when a utilitys transmission lines connect to an interstate grid the utilitys energy commingles with that of other utilities so that inevitably some energy is transmitted across state lines and becomes interstate in nature the department said The states have argued that they will not unbundle the retail sale of energy into the categories of delivery and actual electricity delivered a measure designed to help reduce prices for consumers for fear of losing jurisdiction over transmissions associated with retail transactions FERCs actions therefore actually undermine competition not foster it according to the states In its brief the Justice Department brushed aside such criticism saying the argument assumes that states will not weigh their consumers best interests in deciding for or against retail wheeling but will be concerned only with protecting their own jurisdiction Though not yet scheduled the case will probably be heard sometime next fall Nos New York et al vs FERC et al and Enron vs FERC By MICHAEL KIRKLAND

internal to Enron Government Affairs the concept of opening the Large Industrial Market to eCommerce I f we think this is reasonable maybe we can make a pitch to the Enron NetWork s It is my recollection that the current regulatory rules related to customer switching and marketer enrollment do not allow large consumers to buy energ y on a less than monthly basis there is no switching within the month LDC s have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were paid and energy flows were in balance To me this regulatory restriction makes no sense at all First big consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly staff and resources Second big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute lowest price Third big consumers control the load which if proper price signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks Finally the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous they buy and sell energy hourly To initiate this discussion I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho could find out in CA and PA respectively if I am correct about the regulatory restrictions The other question for Jeff Brown is whether or not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the purchasing of the large customer full requirements for example metering data needs etc Does this make sense to everyone If I am way out in left field lets not do alot of work It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce JDS Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on AM ENRON From Office of the NRON on PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Enron Net Works It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha ve a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad array of industries Through EnronOnLine Enron has quickly become a major catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch Since launch w e have completed transactions on line with a total dollar value of ov er billion EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very specific reason In addition to providing a webbased platform for transactions Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site We stand ready at all times in any market conditions to buy and se ll at the posted price This converts a bulletin board the more typi cal eCommerce concept into a true market There are very few if any competitors that can provide this capability We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies If we are correct this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro n Accordingly we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity Effective today we are creating a new business Enron Net Works to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a broad range of industries It is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment joining transmission distribution wholesale retail and broadband services Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along with significant talent and resources in market making and finance Initially North America will provide primary direct support for staff services and back office however over time we will be requesting support services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and success To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these new eCommerce platforms Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan t functions of North America Europe South America CALME Asia and Broadban d Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley Chief Executive Officer Mi ke McConnell Chief Operating Officer and Jeff McMahon Chief Commercial Officer These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron North America is Dave Delainey who will also join Enrons Executive Committee Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net Works It will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as an Enron global function Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology Officer for all of Enron Corp and continues to be responsible for the development of worldwide technology standards and platforms EnronOnLine headed by Louise Kitchen will also remain intact and will now be a part of Enron Net Works The success of EnronOnLine enables us to utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets In addition the following individuals are included in Enron Net Works along with their current eCommerce initiatives Harry Arora Public Financial Securities Ja y Fitzgerald New Markets Identification Bruce Garner Metals and Greg Pipe r Pulp and Paper Over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational design and

review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

implications For instance what happens to DWR contracts Will they be assigned to SCE Wi ll customers have the right to choose going forward The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers c an make their own energy decisions going forward We know that Government doesnt know how to get this right The right answer is giving customers more choices not fewer Cant endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full If the bills arent paid in full highly likely that well see involuntary bankruptcy Too bad that this deal wasnt done earlier It could have saved alot of money and pain Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal May nev er happen Make it easy just deal with the under collection through securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM From Jeff Dasovich on PM Sent by Jeff Dasovich To Alan CT Angela ES Beverly ES Bill ES Brenda ES Carol ES Cathy ES Chris

within the month LDC s have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were paid and energy flows were in balance To me this regulatory restriction makes no sense at all First big consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly staff and resources Second big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute lowest price Third big consumers control the load which if proper price signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks Finally the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous they buy and sell energy hourly To initiate this discussion I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho could find out in CA and PA respectively if I am correct about the regulatory restrictions The other question for Jeff Brown is whether or not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the purchasing of the large customer full requirements for example metering data needs etc Does this make sense to everyone If I am way out in left field lets not do alot of work It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce JDS Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on AM ENRON From Office of the NRON on PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Enron Net Works It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha ve a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad array of industries Through EnronOnLine Enron has quickly become a major catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch Since launch w e have completed transactions on line with a total dollar value of ov er billion EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very specific reason In addition to providing a webbased platform for transactions Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site We stand ready at all times in any market conditions to buy and se ll at the posted price This converts a bulletin board the more typi cal eCommerce concept into a true market There are very few if any competitors that can provide this capability We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies If we are correct this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro n Accordingly we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity Effective today we are creating a new business Enron Net Works to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a broad range of industries It is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment joining transmission distribution wholesale retail and broadband services Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along with significant talent and resources in market making and finance Initially North America will provide primary direct support for staff services and back office however over time we will be requesting support services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and success To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these new eCommerce platforms Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan t functions of North America Europe South America CALME Asia and Broadban d Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley Chief Executive Officer Mi ke McConnell Chief Operating Officer and Jeff McMahon Chief Commercial Officer These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

is going to increase supply decrease demand and increase customer choice Still doesnt make sense to us to have the state buy a crumbling transmission network instead of school lunches We dont have enough details There are several aspects that are interesti ng and could use further study Governor Davis needs to make the details publ ic as soon as possible so people can understand the full implications For instance what happens to DWR contracts Will they be assigned to SCE Wi ll customers have the right to choose going forward The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers c an make their own energy decisions going forward We know that Government doesnt know how to get this right The right answer is giving customers more choices not fewer Cant endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full If the bills arent paid in full highly likely that well see involuntary bankruptcy Too bad that this deal wasnt done earlier It could have saved alot of money and pain Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal May nev er happen Make it easy just deal with the under collection through securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM From Jeff Dasovich on PM Sent by Jeff Dasovich To Alan CT Angela ES Beverly ES Bill ES Brenda ES Carol ES Cathy ES Chris

and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

internal to Enron Government Affairs the concept of opening the Large Industrial Market to eCommerce I f we think this is reasonable maybe we can make a pitch to the Enron NetWork s It is my recollection that the current regulatory rules related to customer switching and marketer enrollment do not allow large consumers to buy energ y on a less than monthly basis there is no switching within the month LDC s have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were paid and energy flows were in balance To me this regulatory restriction makes no sense at all First big consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly staff and resources Second big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute lowest price Third big consumers control the load which if proper price signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks Finally the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous they buy and sell energy hourly To initiate this discussion I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho could find out in CA and PA respectively if I am correct about the regulatory restrictions The other question for Jeff Brown is whether or not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the purchasing of the large customer full requirements for example metering data needs etc Does this make sense to everyone If I am way out in left field lets not do alot of work It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce JDS Forwarded by James D SteffesHOUEES on AM ENRON From Office of the NRON on PM To All Enron Worldwide cc Subject Enron Net Works It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha ve a significant and continuing impact on

been an enormous success since its launch Since launch w e have completed transactions on line with a total dollar value of ov er billion EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very specific reason In addition to providing a webbased platform for transactions Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site We stand ready at all times in any market conditions to buy and se ll at the posted price This converts a bulletin board the more typi cal eCommerce concept into a true market There are very few if any competitors that can provide this capability We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies If we are correct this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro n Accordingly we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity Effective today we are creating a new business Enron Net Works to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a broad range of industries It is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment

and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim

costofservice basis for years Dedication of Power Edison International will commit the entire outp ut of Sunrise one of Edison Internationals nonregulated generating faciliti es to the State on a fixed price basis for years Phase I of Sunrise is to be brought online by August If not brought online by August Edison International shall be assessed a million penalty Transmission Sale SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for approximately billion times the net book value of the assets subject to certain adjustments Of the billion the billion gain on sale will be used to reduce SCEs net undercollected amount as of Ja nuary In connection with the purchase the State will also assume certa in liabilities associated with the transmission assets Backup Transaction If the transmission sale does not occur within tw o years for reasons beyond the parties control then if the State elects SCE shall sell to the State SCEs hydro generation assets If the hydro asse ts are not worth billion then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe r enough belowmarketpricepower to make up the shortfall Conservation Property SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen ts to the State covering approximately acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr ic related lands and acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related lands Some of the land may be deeded in fee Contribution by

The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected amount less the gain on sale plus interest on certain obligations in the net undercollected amount The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not occur within two years Accordingly the second tranche would not show up in rates for two years if at all Buying the Net Short The State will be required to buy the net short through December After SCE will be responsible for covering the net short Investment Recovery SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will not drop below its current rte during the year cost of service ratemaking period Next Steps Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action Definitive Agreements Once the MOU is signed the next stage is to negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the transmission sale as well as the specific terms of the various other relat ed agreements eg the OM Agreement Transmission Services Agreement and th e Facilities Services Agreement CPUC Action Prior to entering into the definitive agreements the CP UC must undertake certain actions which include establishing mechanisms for preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs deferring SCEs general rate case until granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and clarifying the first

Advocacy Positions i concur From James D NRON on AM CST To Kevin M CT Tim CT cc Alan CT Christi L CT Joe nron Mary CT Sarah nron Steve CT Susan J MaraNAEnron Ron nron Jeff nron Steven J nron Richard nron Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions To the discussion I would add the following Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult to get the right zones Moreover in markets like ERCOT the zonal structure has been coopted by the large incumbents to frustrate the development of the market One solution discussed throughout the East is the Hybrid model LMP in the realtime and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion If structured properly this allows the power desk to have a a realtime energy market and b managable transmission risk There are disagreements between the policy experts about Flowgates see point Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for Enron Key goals single control area for the RTO real time energy market with no penalties for unbalanced positions market hubs similar to PJM West for liquidty and manageable transmission congestion using market solutions I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with one perfect market structure proposal for Enron both for technical and timing reasons California is in a different place than SPP We are trying to coordinate our statements in each of the markets as much as possible Most importantly and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately we need to make sure that saying something in one market doesnt damage our other advocacy efforts Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context We still hear some open questions about the best form of marketbased congestion managment option vs obligation use it or lose it Christi Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues Please contact her if anyone from your teams should attend Call with any other questions At some point we need to ensure complete agreement of our policys and our advocacy efforts on RTOs Jim Kevin M CT PM To Tim CT cc James D nron Christi L CT Sarah NRON Joe NRON Steve CT Alan CT Mary CT Subject Re RTO Advocacy Positions Are you putting words in my mouth Tim The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid realtime energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary that is subject to much debate Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market we may have settle for a limited LMP in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion but proxy buses are created in zones per RTO for purposes of realtime energy markets Our views I believe are still very much aligned however I need to make some progress on the creation of real time energy markets The zonal markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a mispriced commodity with no real price signal sent to the market Out of merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion is managed through energy uplift payments congestion price signal is not sent to the market This results in a very inefficient commodity market where the consumer gets screwed and market makers cant price the commodity or transportation on a forward basis I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision for RTOs that was developed by the east desk This vision seems to differ somewhat from what we are advocating in the west In particular it seems like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in the zonal flowgate camp I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of the nodal approach in particular how do the nodes map to a fairly homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions ie a transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it versus assetbased trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade settles with the market It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant different models For example the west has large longdistance high voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach The east has more local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily It also could be that the political reality in the east and west require different positions As things sit now there is no way that a zonal approach could fly in the northwest In contrast PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal Finally it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference of opinion on what the ideal market structure should be If that is the case then perhaps we need to talk some more Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west I dont think that we can come up with a broad nationwide advocacy position at this time That is I dont think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as the answer at FERC Instead I think that we should focus on the objectives that RTOs should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the best market structure should be to achieve these objectives What do you guys think about this Regards Tim

LandwehrNAEnron on AM Fein David I CHI PM To cc Townsend Christopher J CHI Subject Crains January Sue Roy We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest To solve gas bill crisis turn heat up on Peoples Crains Editorial January Considering the fingerpointing thats going on between politicians regulators and Peoples Energy Corp executives one thing is becoming obvious Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices is much simpler than fixing the problem Nonetheless all of these factions bear some responsibility for this winters monthly home heating bills which for many residents are soaring by hundreds of dollars over last winters tabs Each of these groups should be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to blunt future price spikes Make no mistake about it this crisis will not melt away with the spring thaw Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just

demand will continue to pump up bills rattle price stability and along with other climbing energy rates become the economys unwelcome X factor The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities especially Peoples Energy the citys natural gas provider To start with the utilitys management must protect customers by anticipating escalating demand hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can These are common business practices used by corporations and even some conservative utilities In Michigan for example gas providers charge fixed rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance under longterm supply contracts Right now Michigan pays cents per therm compared with the Chicago areas whopping cents Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission ICC which regulates the utility on what the fixed rate should be In walking away from the deal Peoples left customers with the current rate system and dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them In essence instead of managing risk it put its customer base at risk Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout critics are asking whether Peoples a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the publics needs is acting in the best interest of its customers Those paying heating bills which in some cases are as much as higher than last winters are right to say no as is Mayor Richard Daley whos outraged at Peoples More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the challenge of resolving this crisis especially if its recent handling of the political fallout is an indication The company acts as if the public has no right to question its tactics or motivations And when the Chicago City Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didnt show up At these prices its not asking too much for the chairman of the gas utility to explain his companys position Thats not a job meant for a public relations executive or a consultant who were among the Peoples advocates who actually did attend the council hearing The ICC shoulders its share of the blame too It should have more zealously monitored the gas supply situation and the utilitys plans Now the commission is playing catchup by holding an investigation into what Peoples knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it Lets get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all if there is pricegouging going on Just as critical however is the need to foster a statewide regulatory environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging storing and pricecontrol strategies If there is any ambiguity in state law about the utilitys ability to do this then the General Assembly should change the rules and open up the process Peoples management regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in energy prices Otherwise were all just burning money Gas flareup gives city hot idea Become a utility But coops mean high risks mild rewards Utility man William Abolt head of Chicagos Department of the Environment is examining ways to cut residents natural gas bills One option opening a cityowned buying coop Photo Steve Leonard January By Steve Daniels mailto Its easier said than done Thats something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gaspurchasing duties on behalf of city residents Mr Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corps failure to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas to mitigate a huge runup in residents monthly heating bills this winter He thinks the city can aid billpayers and punish Peoples by developing a system that will funnel lowercost gas to ratepayers But the track record of other municipal gas utilities or buying cooperatives shows that such a system isnt likely to achieve more than modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant financial risks To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this winter the city would have to buy futures or longterm contracts that could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially In addition the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to nonpaying customers activities for which municipalities are illsuited Despite the risks utility critics contend that city intervention is appropriate Its a creative approach and we need those says Martin R Cohen executive director of the Citizens Utility Board a consumer watchdog group These are extreme times and innovative approaches are called for Most municipalities that have gotten into the gasbuying business have been unwilling to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts that can shield consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this years homeheating bills soaring nearly compared with last years Thats because such arrangements can boomerang on customers locking them into higherthanmarket gas costs if prices fall New York experience We wrestled with this Should government really be in this business says David Fountaine village administrator in Hamburg NY a suburb of Buffalo that formed a buying group for its residents in April In our case by being in it weve helped our residents Hamburg and nearby Sloan NY together hired a unit of Texaco Inc to supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities program New York opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago so residents can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside marketer About onethird of Hamburgs households buy gas from the village Those residents gas bills last winter were lower than the bills of households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co Last month when gas prices shot up the villages price was lower than the utilitys But Mr Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks making no longterm bets on the direction of gas prices Rather it simply relies on its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings We know there are a lot of relatively new riskmanagement techniques being used by large natural gas consumers says William Abolt commissioner of the citys Department of Environment We want to know what does the industry do to manage price risk Thats what the reasonable company does but thats not what the local gas company does City officials need look no further than Downstate where the Illinois Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of communities that provide monopoly gas service to their residents Last September the agency locked in prices for to of their customers winter gas needs rolling with the market for the remainder That strategy is serving the agencys customers well Theyre paying around cents per therm the measurement the gas industry uses for billing this month compared with the cents per therm that Peoples is charging Chicagoarea customers Theres no reason why investorowned utilities couldnt do the same thing says John Bell the Municipal Gas Agencys general manager I think a city program is a viable alternative if they dont like what theyve got For its part Peoples supports the citys desire to become involved in the market The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesnt profit on gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to customers Meanwhile the city is just beginning to consider alternatives Although Mr Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during this trying season a program most likely will be launched next winter Weighing the risks The citys top priority will be to help lowincome residents most vulnerable to escalating heating bills but all Chicago residents might be able to choose between the citys program or remaining with Peoples And one possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the market While a fixedprice approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now it can have a downside if not managed properly In the Buffalo area the two major private gas marketers offering fixed prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market forcing some customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service To meet the unanticipated demand the utility was forced to purchase gas on the skyhigh spot market It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing Says Mr Abolt This is not an overnight thing You dont just

Would you like to talk about these matters Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM Susan M Landwehr AM To James D nron cc Harry nron Janine nron Roy ES Subject Crains January Jimplease take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains magazine tomorrow Youll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debatethe ENA Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan The articles and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks point out that Peoples is in hot water politicallyI would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool On the other hand if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate this could be the time to make the playwhile the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not Id appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICCI have not heard back from her but Roy may have Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call Forwarded by Susan M

Phone Fax PR FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PM GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES STATE AGREEMENTS TO SPUR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS SACRAMENTO Governor Gray Davis today announced that the California Energy Commission has signed grants and contracts totaling almost million to install energy smart technology in commercial and industrial buildings throughout the state Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most and beyond Governor Davis said With these grants in place California will continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand responsive building systems technology Demand responsive building systems work by using software that automatically dim lights reduce air conditioning use and cut other electrical loads They operate in response to signals from the Independent System Operator ISO or from an electric utility or service provider Under the agreements commercial electricity customers will agree to shave peak loads by to percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their buildings in real time In addition to these grants the Governor also announced that an additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to the KMart Corporation KMart will use a million grant to replace old lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its California stores The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables program covering the KMart grant are parts of AB which was passed last year The bill is designed to reduce at least megawatts of peak load by June The Governor has proposed an additional million in his New Demand Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional megawatts in savings from demand responsive building systems

cc Phillip K CT Tim CT Mike CT Tim CT Vince J CT Rob CT Kevin M CT Claudio nronXgate Richard nron James D nron Mark nronXgate Scott nronXgate Britt nronXgate Subject California Update Executive Summary The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor An exemption of the gasfired QFs from this bill as proposed by Sen Keeley could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing If passed the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another days after rate hikes to pay the QFs The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the DWR Senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR The CalEnergy ruling as reported by Bloomberg this PM is an attractive option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape longterm supply contracts with Edison If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gasfired generators from the new rate structure an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected However if the exemption is implemented then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed QF Bill Makes it to Senate Floor The CPUC bill the number is not yet known is in mockup form and does the following Repeals PUC Code section which set a formula for QFs under deregulation Amends portions of AB X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its power purchases and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds Includes a provision for SDGE rates since they were not covered under other legislation The bill passed the Senate Energy and also just passed the Senate Appropriations Committee and is headed to the Senate Floor Senator Comments on the Bill Keeley author of bill presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide the QF contracts which is the proper authority to debate the issue Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for natural gasfired QFs Republicans offered an amendment to not have section repealed for gasfired generators but Keeley had concerns with the amendment Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUCs flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad He also indicated that gasfired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order He said that the PUC order needs to be amended and Keeley is confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past hours Opponents to the QF Bill The following people testified in opposition to QF portion TURN Delta Power QF Syke Energy John Hancock Financial California Manufacturers Association Crockett Cogeneration Independent Energy Producers Clean Power Campaign PGE SCE The gasfired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been offline for a couple of months and cannot come back online unless their issues are addressed In response to the QFs not getting paid Sen Bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy PGE and SCE Testimony Sen Battin asked both utilities about the draft order which states that after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within days and whether the utilities would abide by the order PGEs response was that they are receiving million per month the cost of their own generation is million and the QF amount is million per month the draft order would lower the QF cost to million PGE was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to Battins question was yes or no Battin Bowen and Murray all asked whether it was yes or no The PGE rep stated that it would be no if the issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved If the ISO costs of purchases were included in the DWR payments then PGE would not have a problem The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out then it could not comply with the PUC order Payments to DWR Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB X that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and conditions Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill and that they should have a trust fund set up PGE noted that they are setting some money aside but would not state how much Sen Sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or go after them for violating the law X Provisions Tim Gage from Dept of Finance noted the Governors support of the entire bill and noted that the X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid PGE also testified in opposition to these provisions Senator Bowen made the following statements Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless PGE and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR issue Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue

Enron Sandi McCubbin Enron SF cc Jeff Dasovich Enron SF Scott Govenar Enron lobbyist Sue Mara at Enron SF Bev Hansen Enron lobbyist Hedy Govenar Enron Sacto lobbyist Subject FW Demand Bidding Legislation what used to be ABX Wright Here is a note from Mike Florio of the ISO Board This is encouraging he wants to talk further about how the ISO programs can be changed to accomplish what we want What would be most helpful is an item by item analysis by EES read Harry and his people as to why the existing or proposed ISO programs are inadequate or why we need to have X amended to have the ISO do programs for direct access customers parallel to the utility programs in X I need this information soon in order to keep the dialogue going with Florio Thanks for your help Mike Day Original Message From Mike Florio mailto Sent Wednesday March PM To MDay Subject Re Demand Bidding Legislation what used to be ABX Wright Just to show how up to speed I am I thought that the ISO was already planning to do this Their presentation on demand programs at the last board meeting showed a scheduling coordinator option and a UDC option with different billing and settlement provisions for each But its hard for me to judge what is adequate and userfriendly and what is not absent some expert help Im definitely interested in the concept and have no great faith in utility management of programs of this nature Lets pursue MIKE PS In his own inimitable way Dan Richard offered me the ORA job way back when I said Gee Dan I thought we were friends When he acted all surprised and hurt in that way of his I reminded him that Marty Lyons and Mark Loy come with the turf End of discussion At PM you wrote Mike I wanted your reaction to a proposal we were making in response to the Wright X bill on demand bidding programs We strongly support these programs and feel that ESPs can bring a lot of benefit to the program by aggregaring customers educating them on the benefits of bidding Negawatts and helping to meter and verify their load reductions We are certain that we could help enroll more customers in the program than if the utilities alone were in charge So we proposed language for X which allowed ESPs to aggregate customers in the utility day ahead and hour ahead programs and proposed an additional day ahead program based on economic value not reliability criteria like reserve margins The utilities and the large customers wanted to clarify that we would not include direct access customers in the utility programs because of the odd funding source reductions from the amounts paid to DWR We agreed with the concept we dont want to fund demand reduction programs for Direct Access customers through DWR payments but we also feel strongly that there should be similar nondiscriminatory demand reduction programs for all types of customers including DA So we came up with the idea of inserting language in the bill to require the ISO to institute demand bidding programs which match the ones mandated in the bill for the IOUs I gave our suggestion to Robin Larson and I dont imagine youve seen it yet but would you give me your reaction to the basic concept I looked at the ISO website and tried to evaluate the demand bidding programs already in placewith a limited amount of understanding but Enrons business folks indicated that they did not consider the existing programs to be the equivalent of what the utilities will be implementing If that is so how about putting similar programs in place so we can actively market and encourage all customers to bid their negawatts especially the economic bid and contract in advance deals so that the ISO can count on the demand reductions in advance of a days operations I await your response I am so sorry you are not the next ORA director I was certain you would be appointed to that too gallows humor Mike Day

First I assume that we can enter testimony into the docket without being a witness at this hearing Second the way the hearing has two groups a good guys with facts finding the guilty and b the apologists for the guilty makes it difficult for me to know which panel I would recommend that we join Our message doesnt seek to find blame just solutions Finally given the upcoming FERC hearing why not make our case in that process where I think the witch hunt mentality wont be so high I can be persuaded otherwise on this case Either way however my assumption is that we need to work toward getting FERC informed and ready to do the right thing and manage the CPUC and other CA issues to do no harm Jim Jeff Dasovich PM To Mona L ES cc James D ES Harry ES Paul CT Susan J ES Sandra ES Mary

FERC inquiry Also attached are some messages that Jim distributed following a focus group conducted in Orange County Mona L Petrochko PM To Mona L ES cc James D ES Harry ES West GA Mary nron Richard ES Karen nron Peggy ES Mark NRON Sarah nron Joe nron Tim CT Subject Re Comments on Wholesale Issues I spoke w Bill Julian Cmmr Woods Advisor about the hearing that is being held on Friday September in San Diego There will be a morning panel and an afternoon panel The morning panel will discuss pricing behaviorpatterns and the afternoon panel will provide explanationsrefutations of the morning presentations Im not sure yet who will be speaking but I have inquired from Steve Weisman who appears to be heading this effort Do we want an Enron representative on the panel Who would be the best witness While this investigation has the opportunity to turn into a witch hunt I am also concerned about the record being developed in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that Wood or the legislature have in mind This could mean an attempt by the Commission to assert more regulation in the market assert more state vs federal jurisdiction build a case for collapsing the ISOPX into one organization or hang blame on generators and scheduling coordinators I think Tim and Marys presentation would be very effective in showing the other real side of the story The following is an exerpt from the prehearing conference transcript held on from Cmmr Wood I am not going to sit here and say that its not an appropriate time to assign blame If there has been wrongdoing we will assign blame We will ferret out the wrongdoers and we will bring them to account to the greatest of our ability But I think that as Judge Wetzell pointed out the scope of this proceeding is quite broad We are not only addressing the immediate issues but we are also addressing the underlying problems of this market which clearly is not functioning which clearly is broken We have to look at problems with the structure of the market we have to look at problems with the behavior of market participants and getting beyond the wholesale market we have to look at the interaction with the retail market because after all thats where the pain actually occurs Thats what consumers themselves face There are probably implications for the longterm viability of Californias utilities that are connected with this proceeding and we have to get into that And for that reason as well as the fact that the other utilities in California are going to be coming out of the rate freeze at some point in the future we have to consider the statewide implications of what were doing So this is not just the San Diego proceeding although we are focused on events here in the San Diego area Mona L Petrochko PM To James D ES Harry ES West GA Mary nron Richard ES Karen nron Peggy ES Mark NRON cc Subject Comments on Wholesale Issues Wood the Assigned Commissioner in the investigation of wholesale electric markets has asked for comments on the following questions by Friday September We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of ARM and WPTF This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the record The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be helpful in answering these questions I will take a first cut at drafting response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week We can take liberties in providing responses that go beyond the question asked Market Structure Are the market conditions currently being experienced price spikes and suppy shortages inevitable under the current market structure Do generators andor scheduling coordinators have market power Is there a need to mitigate such market power Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability planning Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure reasonable prices and reliable service Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service Market Rules Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes What roles if any do underscheduling in forward markets out of state transfers uniform PX auction prices and ISO realtime and outofmarket purchases play in the outcomes being experienced Behavior of Market Participants

March PWP by Bart McGuire A B S T R A C T S Regulation and the Leverage of Local Market Power in the California Electricity Market September PWP by James B Bushnell and Frank A Wolak Regulators of electricity markets around the world continue to struggle with the problem of incentivizing generators whose output due to their location in the grid has no viable substitutes Such generators possess local market power Since these generators also compete in broader regional markets the actions taken to exploit their local market power can also effect market outcomes over larger areas In California a contract structure known as the reliability mustrun RMR contract was developed to address the problem of local market power However the contract form that was in place during created serious incentive problems We find that during the months of June through September RMR contracts had the effect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers thereby leading to higher energy prices in the California regional market Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Electricity Markets Should the Rest of the World Adopt the UK Reforms July PWP by Catherine Wolfram Policy makers everywhere have analyzed and tried to learn from the UK electricity restructuring adopting some of the same market features but modifying others Now the British government has embarked on a radical reform of their electricity industry called the Programme to Reform the Electricity Trading Arrangements or RETA The changes to the electricity market are slated for September Some of the changes will bring the UK in line with what other countries have done but other changes will be unique Is the UK poised to leapfrog the rest of the world adopting every market feature that has proved successful and modifying those that have not Should the rest of the world be following the UKs lead on some of these changes This paper argues that the answer is a decisive no to both questions While proposed reforms to introduce demandside bidding and encourage financial innovation make sense the governments proposal to pay suppliers their bids rather than the market clearing price will not help

Frontier Evidence from the US Electricity Industry September PWP by Christopher R Knittel Many policymakers are currently weighing the advantages of deregulating electricity markets over more traditional regulatory methods However within this traditional regulatory environment many options exist In particular the use of incentive regulation programs in US electricity markets has grown during the past two decades These programs differ in both their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals In this paper I discuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized and investigate the impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a large set of coal and natural gas generator units Within a stochastic frontier framework I allow the distribution of inefficient production to be a function of the regulatory environment the plant operates under The results suggest that while certain incentive regulations increase observed technical efficiency others have either no effect or even lead to a reduction in efficiency Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Understanding Competitive Pricing and Market Power in Wholesale Electricity Markets August PWP by Severin Borenstein Discussions of competition in restructured electricity markets have revealed many misunderstandings about the definition diagnosis and implications of market power In this paper I attempt to clarify the meaning of market power and show how it can be distinguished from competitive pricing in markets with significant shortrun supply constraints I also address two common myths about market power a that it is present in all markets and b that it must be present in order for firms to remain profitable in markets with significant fixed costs I conclude by arguing that while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Pricing Electricity for Default Customers Pass Through or PerformanceBased Rates August PWP by Carl Blumstein California electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity service provider but most have not done so These consumers remain by default customers of the utility distribution companies UDCs Pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the California Public Utilities Commission In California this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performancebased rate PBR Under the first alternative purchase from the California Power Exchange PX would be mandatory under the second each UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDCs performance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price This paper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the two alternatives First the paper examines the effects of the two alternatives on electricity prices The analysis suggests that at least in the near term the choice will not have much effect on prices Next the paper looks at possible perverse incentives A central concern here is that if providing default service becomes profitable UDCs might use their distribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market Finally the paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives and concludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a PBR Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Regulatory Imperfections in the Electricity and Natural Gas Industries Evidence from the Pricing and Investment Decisions of Single and MultiProduct Electricity Firms July PWP by Christopher R Knittel Electricity and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by one of two market structures In some markets electricity and natural gas are sold by a dualproduct regulated monopolist while in other markets electricity and natural gas are sold by separate singleproduct regulated monopolies This paper analyzes the relative pricing and investment decisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures The unique relationship between these two products namely that electricity and natural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input into the generation of electricity allows me to gain inferences regarding the efficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industries The results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gas generation are higher in a dualproduct setting both suggestive that regulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and natural gas firms Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Diagnosing Market Power in Californias Deregulated Wholesale Electricity Market July PWP by Severin Borenstein James Bushnell and Frank Wolak Effective competition in wholesale electricity markets is the cornerstone of the deregulation of the electricity generation industry We examine the degree of competition in the California wholesale electricity market during JuneNovember by comparing the market prices with estimates of the prices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers We find that there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that it was most pronounced during the highest demand periods Overall this raised the cost of power purchases by about above the competitive level We also explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitive peakload pricing Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Zonal Pricing and DemandSide Bidding in the Norwegian Electricity Market June PWP by Tor Arnt Johnsen Shashi Kant Verma and Catherine Wolfram PWP analyzes prices in the dayahead electricity market in Norway We consider the hypothesis that generators are better able to exercise market power when transmission constraints bind resulting in smaller moreconcentrated markets We test this hypothesis by comparing equilibrium prices across periods with different demand elasticity and with and without binding transmission constraints We find some empirical evidence that prices in local markets are higher during constrained periods when demand is less elastic Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Transmission Rights and Market Power November PWP by James Bushnell Stakeholders throughout the United States are currently working to reach a consensus on the structure and protocols that will define tradable transmission rights in the context of the various wholesale electricity markets and their associated Independent System Operators ISOs now forming in different regions of the US Much of the discussion has focused on the relative merits of physical transmission rights in comparison with financial transmission rights To the extent that transmission rights provide their owners with an added level of influence or control over transmission markets some of the historical industry concerns over vertical market power may need to be revisited In this paper I discuss some of the potential concerns over transmission rights and their use for the exercise of various forms of market power Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf PowerGrid Decentralization March PWP by Bart McGuire Most of the literature concerned with decentralized operations in power grids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main parts the transmission system and the market of users the ISO and the PX and asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properly coordinated While a number of studies have gone on to examine decentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumers little attention has been given to how the operation of the transmission system itself might be decentralized In this paper we propose an organizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers of given subgrids of a larger system Noninvasive pricequantity dialogs are defined that under fairly general circumstances bring about perfect shortrun coordination of the aggregate grid Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf

James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mona L ES PM To Gary ES cc Douglas ES Martin ES West GA Harry ES James D nron Joe nron Subject Re SDGE represenatation of future market conditions Gary Thanks for passing this information along This is a pretty welldocumented discussion which is always helpful when we contact the utility about such conduct Obviously this is very concerning about SDGE countermarketing while promoting choice In addition some of their assumptions seem to require tremendous leaps of faith I havent seen an application to aggregate yet but I would assume there would be heavy protests to such a proposal SDGE solicited my feedback on such a position and I told them we werent interested Im not sure what type of ruling they are expecting from FERC lower price caps or a return to costbased rates pretty extreme Decision per Sue Mara is not expected until December SDGE does have bilateral contracting authority and at least thus far has not exercised it Customers have already experienced what leaving it to SDGE will get them Once bitten twice shy Enron Energy Services From Gary Mirich PM Phone No To Mona L ES cc Douglas ES Martin WenzelSFOHOUEES Subject SDGE represenatation of future market conditions Mona I thought you should have the following information due to your ongoing work with SDGE to facilitate open market choice by their regulated customers As you know Ive been working with SAIC to close business for the last days We had offered them a month price on of their load for approximately centskWh They compared our offers to others that were significantly higher As part of their decisionmaking process and in an attempt to confirm that SDGE wasnt preparing to release any kind of drastic rate reductionrelief in the immediate future SAICs treasurer called SDGEs CEO for a meeting with an SDGE exec On SAICs treasurer Dan Baldwin met with SDGEs SVP of Fuels and Power Ops Gary Cotton Another SAIC exec Rene Terrazas VP Real Estate was also in that meeting He is my source for the following comments from SDGE SDGE expects to be given authority very soon to aggregate customers much like direct access providers in order to provide betterthanmarket pricing SDGE expects FERC to come out with something that will reduce the prices that retail standard offer customers are paying No detail from SDGE on what form FERCs action would take or when SDGEs recent bilateral contracting authority should result in lower prices for SAIC SDGE suggested that very few customers have switched to DA because their is too much uncertainty about the future He said that SAIC is part of of SDGEs customers that have not switched to date This SDGE exec said he thought that prices would soon return to a more reasonable level and that SAIC should be expecting direct access prices around centskWh Even though SAIC currently suffers from analysisparalysis SDGEs comments about the state of the market are very concerning First pawning off SAIC to an exec in fuels and ops for advise about the retail open market hardly seems appropriate Second SDGEs suggestion to SAIC that they are somehow in good company by waiting is directly in contrast to what SDGEs regulatory affairs people are attempting to promote with the supplier selection initiative Third for SDGE to even hint that there are regulatory FERC CPUC or otherwise fixes soon to be announced that will relieve SAICs pricing dilema is at the very least irresponsible In Renes opinion the SDGE exec was using the same old fear uncertainty and doubt lines that utility execs typically employed prior to direct access in their efforts to retain customers Finally and most concerning to me is that SDGE has an executive willing to make a guess about the price SAIC should be expecting to receive in this market Many market sources eg Bloomberg besides Enron wouldnt predict a price as low as cents Nevermind that Mr Cotton is likely unqualified to make such a claim but even if he was I think he is way off base for even entertaining the question In light of our efforts to work with SDGE to facilitate customer transition to DA I think these comments indicate that their executive team is not truly on board with the work of SDGEs regulatory affairs EES is in a stand down right now with SAIC who decided after their meeting with SDGE that Enrons offer may not be as competitive as previously believed Their treasurer has decided to wait and see perhaps a month or more Irrespective of my ability to close this deal today or in the future I wanted you to be aware of the SDGEs comments and how theyve impacted one SDGE customers decision to leave the utility Perhaps we should suggest that customer inquiries like those of SAIC go through regulatory affairs instead of execs who have twisted andor minimal information and a willingness to guess about the future Your comments welcome thanks much Gary

bloc ks of customers at good rates below the historic bundled rate New Powe r looks like it will win or at least share in the customers Something to think about in CA Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM PennFuture PM Please respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market November Vol No Pennsylvanias First Successful CDS Auction An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC over which company has won the right to provide default generation service to customers of PECO Energy an Exelon Company This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is th e fruit of the PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement a landmar k document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed i t The peace treaty includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de fault service for of its customers and PECO has done so Green Mountain Ener gy Company is now challenging PECO Energys decision that New Power won the auction to provide the settlements mandated default service Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those consumers smal l rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources Specificall y New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R residential customers for approximately cents per kilowatthour That offer is cents per kilowatthour less than PECO Energys unbundled generation and transmission rate of cents per kilowatthour and cents per kilowatthour less than the shopping credit of The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by th e stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy Indeed were it not for stranded cost payments the New Power and Green Mountain offers wou ld reduce total bills by about cents per kilowatthour or The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels It also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economicall y Finally the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in California over a period of nearly three years When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner if all consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider the total number of customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil l jump to more than Of this total will be residential customers of PECO a number equal to of the PECO residential class CDS Background In Pennsylvania there must always be a default sup plier or provider of last resort to assure that service is always available to all customers The incumbent utility is the default supplier unless the PUC decides otherwise The default supplier must provide generation service to customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose not to shop or did not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price The PECO Restructuring Case Settlement initially defined CDS service in paragra ph On January of all of PECOs residential customers de termined by random selection including lowincome and inabilitytopay customers a nd without regard to whether such customers are obtaining generation service from an EGS shall be assigned to a provider of last resortdefault supplier other than PECO that will be selected on the basis of a Commissionapproved energy and capacity market price bidding process This service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service CDS The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU PPL and APS restructuring cases CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas t one other large competitor in each market CDS also has a renewable portfol io standard RPS even though there is no RPS for regulated utilities in Pennsylvania The winning bidder must supply of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable re sources of solar wind sustainable biomass including landfill gas but excluding incineration of Municipal Solid Waste geothermal or ocean power The renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of thereafter This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely meaning that in year four of the CDS there will be a renewable requirement in year five and so on This is significant as each extra percent of renewable energy used to serve the customer block prevents approximately tons of NOx tons of SO and tons of CO from being emitted b y fossil fuel burning power plants PECOs CDS RFP Importantly the PECOUnicom merger case modified the CD S bidding process as established by the settlement Of particular note the revisions eliminated the customer care functions from CDS made the contract three years long to help spread out return of startup costs and instituted several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts yielded no successful CDS contract PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April and Shell Energy Services submitted the only bid However the PUC rejected the bid as nonconforming and denied Shells Petition for Reconsideration of its decision Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement PECO entered into bilateral negotiations based on an August RFP Three suppliers submitted conforming bids and PECO selected New Power as t he winner on October New Power is the new competitive supplier actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO service territory and is backed by Enron AOL and IBM PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC fo r approval on November Under the proposal PECO and New Power expand ed the size of the CDS requirement to include of nonshopping residential customers instead of of all residential customers whether shopping or not This change was designed to implement paragraph of the Restructuring Settlement requiring adjustments to the numbers assigned to CDS in order to have of all PECO residential and commercial customers obtaining competitive generation as of January There also will be a second round of assignment of nonshopping customers as of October if New Power is providing CDS to fewer than of all PECO residential customers New Power electricity will be renewable in renewable in and renewable in as required but does not include a commitment to exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the nonrenewable portion of the product The price for New Powers CDS for Rate R customers would be below the shopping credit while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay less than their shopping credit For a Rate R customer this would me an that overall rates would fall as energy and transmission falls from to for Rate RH rates would fall Customers assigned to CDS may still choose any competitive supplier or opt out and retain default servic e from PECO without penalty or charge New Power will be able to offer its fu ll slate of energy and nonenergy related products to these customers Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECONew Power contract is not in the public interest arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountains o ffer that included CDS pricing below the shopping credit for all residential customers including those on residential heating or offpeak service Like the New Power proposal the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and RH rates and respectively Green Mountain asserts that the New Power rate cut for Rate R is only and not and argues that its product i s better for the environment because the nonrenewable portion of the product would come from natural gas and hydro instead of system power generated primarily from coal and nuclear fuels If not declared the winning bidder Green Mountain proposes in the alternative that both they and New Power receive CDS contracts In response PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to subm it revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not submitted unti l October days after the deadline and nine days after the selection of New Power as the winning bidder The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November Some think tha t the PUC may very well split the customer block between Green Mounta in and New Power Whatever the result customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet another small price reduction more renewable energy and the

Thanks Peter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments

going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who could sell the same energy outside California for should bid no less than This would not be an exercise of market power

URL cfmtrackeprofilecfmum Alternate URL clientcealtcealtabhtml As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices for both power and natural gas September looms as the start of the fall shoulder season The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal September weather Westwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June a month with high power prices In addition compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the West to percent over September levels Continued strong use of gasfired generation in the West as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices Topock prices are expected to average per million British thermal units MMBtu in September These high September gas and power prices are driven by Declining hydroelectric output The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West with rainfall historically boosting output in December Approximately average megawatts aMW will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period This represents a net reduction in capacity of aMW when compared with the recent JuneAugust summer months and a reduction of aMW when compared with September levels Higher more variable power demand The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in September Spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather Thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September High levels of gasfired generation Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour MWh range depending on the region This strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward An additional billion cubic feet Bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the US West compared with September levels Strong North American gas prices Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as North American supplies remain tight A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall As a result average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around per MMBtu An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the mark Strong western basis differentials The strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the California markets CERA expects a TopocktoHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during September Extended operational problems associated with El Pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook Regional Power Market Drivers Hotterthannormal August weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of per MWh during the onpeak period and by per MWh during the offpeak period MidColumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from July price levels of per MWh for the onpeak period and per MWh in the offpeak period Offpeak prices which have averaged above per MWh during the JuneAugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources Onpeak prices during this same period at over per MWh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see Table A return to normal weather should drive Westwide loads down by aMW in September from August levels However load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by aMW when compared with September levels These greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of aMW from last Septembers levels will create supply tightness during September see Tables and Hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve Westwide demand in September even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load Gas demand for power generation is expected to average Bcf per day in September down from over Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic Bcf per day compared with levels in September September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per MWh with prices frequently higher as demand increases As this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight Hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship Cooler or hotterthannormal weather in September coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes Under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per MWh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago September prices see Figure The latest revision of the California Independent System Operators ISOs imbalance energy market cap down to per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least aMW compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of August the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to aMW over the same period see Table Thus the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California These price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation MidColumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per MWh in September Offpeak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south The expected September level of per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path and those to the south As in years past hydrodepleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path import limitations This condition which is expected to persist from September through November allows Northern California to price at a premium The expected monthly average onpeak Northern California price of per MWh incorporates this dynamic Notably the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California in part to capture locational price differences more effectively Southern California like the Southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in September During these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer In addition California as a whole should see average loads in September that are aMW higher than those of September Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California An per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with Southern California onpeak prices averaging per MWh Offpeak prices of and per MWh for Northern and Southern California respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support September offpeak loads Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a September monthly onpeak price average of per MWh and an offpeak price average of per MWh CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns and a strong MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other Strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per MWh level in September Offpeak prices will like those in Southern California be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation A price level of per MWh is expected for offpeak prices Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile The storage deficit now stands at approximately Bcf and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September CERA expects a Henry Hub price of per MMBtu during September In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September especially in California Overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from Bcf per day during August to Bcf per day during September see Table This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month The recent price disconnects between the supplyrich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demandcharged California will persist October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase In general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan On the other hand healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season The startup of the new Alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the Midwest will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per MMBtu before this weekends pipeline explosion Total imports into California reached record levels during July total imports of Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet MMcf per day see Table Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization So far in August pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California and the pressure should continue during September Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support Total demand in the state should average Bcf per day down only slightly from Augusts total of Bcf per day Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately per MMBtu for September see Table Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States but the storage surplus in the region has eroded In California inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown So far this month prices at Malin are averaging a per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly Bcf per day this month Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide MalintoTopock differentials Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the West will likely hold through September In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to Bcf per day from Bcf per day in August This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels For September CERA expects Malin prices to average per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand Although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached percent during July with less than MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply and in general the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin Unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged per MMBtu so far this month and per MMBtu since June Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by MMcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September The San JuantoHenry Hub differential is expected to average per MMBtu As in the Rockies differentials should narrow substantially in October Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal CERA expects the heavy discountcurrent Rocky MountaintoHenry Hub differentials are around per MMBtuto persist through September Local area demand is not expected to change during September Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads October demand should average Bcf per day up from August and September averages of around Bcf per day Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per MMBtu range Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer Next summer pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer Although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedTrailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by MMcf per day next year Western Canada After widening to over US per MMBtu the AECOHenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per MMBtu in July With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the midUSs per MMBtu for September AECO is expected to be US per MMBtu C per gigajoule for September Even with the startup of the Alliance project the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs This will result in differentials that will range between US and US per MMBtu throughout the winter Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last years levels The pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into Supply is expected to be flat with on an annual basis for this year and up at least MMcf per day in Sumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system For September Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of

Richard ES cc Subject fyi Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Martin Kim on PM To cc Subject fyi Didnt know if you saw this column in todays LA Times but he makes some good arguments JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times August Return to Headlines Publication Date Friday August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell their generating plants in the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the sunshine makes them slow END EDT August Copyright Times Mirror Company

task for not getting more competition into the electricity markets Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM PennFuture PM Please respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Breaking Out of the Box PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market February Vol No Breaking Out of the Box Two weeks after his inauguration President Bushs electricity policy is already emerging from the crucible of California and is characterized by obedience to free market ideology and a federalism that confines the federal government to a limited backseat role We are told that Californias crisis is an isolated event the result of Californias unique mistakes In this view the federal government neither contributed to the crisis nor has a major role to play in solving it Wholesale market caps at any level are declared to be an inappropriate intrusion into free markets that can only make things worse Moreover the appointment of Curt Hebert as the new Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC signals that FERC will not assert itself to ensure that wholesale electricity markets are genuinely competitive and that the principles of open access and comparability are more than legal fictions Finally environmental regulation is fingered as a primary obstacle to adequate supplies and reasonable prices This emerging policy begins with a misdiagnosis In fact the mess in California and the West has roots in huge policy mistakes made by both the state and federal governments One such federal mistake was a FERC decision that blocked a competitive solicitation for megawatts of new generation in California Skyrocketing retail electric prices in more and more states due to wholesale market failure will soon make clear to all that the nations electricity problems start in Washington DC with failed wholesale market policies The hot seat will then shift from Governor Gray Davis to federal officials and it will become apparent that strict obedience to free market ideology or a limited role for federal authority will notcurepast mistakes in electric policy President Bush inherits an America where wholesale electricity markets are isolated and dysfunctional ticking time bombs planted beneath his Presidency The fuses on these bombs were lit with the passage of the Energy Policy Act EPACT in which deregulated the price of generation in the wholesale electric market but left FERC with the job of creating a genuinely competitive wholesale market which would restrain prices through competitive pressures But neither FERC nor Congress has ensured the free movement of electricity in interstate commerce or workably competitive markets since the passage of EPACT Market power abuses are rife and most parts of the country dont even have the benefit of an independent system operator to ensure nondiscrimination and open access to the transmission grids Even so FERC will not compel formation of or utility membership in independent system operators Worse yet in the face of opposition from states and several powerful utilities Congress has fiddled its thumbs on national restructuring legislation for five years and has not required a transition to retail competition in every state By failing to open retail markets Congress has ensured that wholesale electricity markets cannot be effectively disciplined by demand changes or longterm retail contracts Meanwhile states behave as if they are electric islands immune from the results of failed federal stewardship of wholesale markets Foolishly they have become a principal stumbling block to optimally sized regional power markets and encourage FERC timidity by banging the drums of states rights on Capitol Hill To this day with megawatts under its control PJM is the largest wholesale market or freetrade zone for electricity in the country and it amounts to no more than percent of the nations electric industry The remaining percent of the industry are divided into hundreds of wholesale markets with unique rules for pricing and operation So nine years after EPACT the bombs have begun to go off first in California where disastrous state policies mixed with federal mistakes have created a spectacular explosion then in Washington and Idaho two states that have not passed retail restructuring laws where retail rates are going up as much as percent and percent respectively And its only a matter of time before these electricity time bombs explode in other states The reality is that both the federal governments actions and inaction have made problems worse in California and elsewhere Denying that fact thwarts any efforts to fix the problem as does attacking environmental protection or endlessly repeating free market and states rights ideology Hopefully its not heresy but it must be said Strong federal action and wise intervention are required if wholesale markets are to be stabilized and made competitive First the federal government must organize the country into or regional wholesale electric markets each administered by an Independent System Operator that has the legal duty and necessary authority to ensure that each market is reliable and genuinely competitive Each ISO must have clear responsibility to identify and prevent market power abuses in order to protect public confidence in electricity markets and prevent more autopsies like that now being done on Californias effort to deregulate Second and absolutely crucial for the formation of competitive electricity markets the federal government should require that every state equip its retail customers with timeofuse metering and appliance control devices thermostat resetting and others which increase the price elasticity of demand Third electric markets cannot be competitive if either the wholesale or retail market remain closed All customers should be allowed to choose electricity suppliers by a certain specific date Fourth fuel diversity and clean energy have a clear value in these markets federal restructuring legislation should promote fuel diversity as well as address a host of major environmental problems by establishing reasonable renewable energy requirements Fifth the federal government must face up to the fact that in periods of peak demand or system emergency conditions suppliers currently have almost total pricing power and that high wholesale price caps are an immediate necessity At such times the price curve looks like a J with prices unlimited by demand changes climbing straight up The three wholesale markets that are administered by viable independent system operators PJM New York and New England all operate with a per megawatthour price cap They use caps not because they arent committed to making competition work but because demand is not currently responsive to price and because these emerging markets are vulnerable to strategic bidding that could destroy public support for more competition The sternest test of leadership for a modern politician is to face down his friends and the greatest act of friendship is to save a friend from himself The President could lessen the need for caps by telling some of his friends in the energy industry that they are behaving like a Marxist caricature of businessmen who only need to be given enough rope in order to hang themselves Some wholesale energy suppliers by persisting in wholesale markets that cannot limit prices by competition or demand response to charge or more per megawatthour prices that greatly exceed any cost or profit requirement have triggered a public reaction that could eventually crush them For example in California the recently passed emergency state statute suspends retail direct access and many communities are understandably beginning the process of forming municipal utilities The President must remind wholesale energy suppliers of the need for restraint while Americas dysfunctional wholesale electricity markets are repaired Americans deserve true functional clean and affordable competitive electric markets Because energy bills often consume at least percent of an average familys income and up to percent of a poor households takehome pay most Americans have little tolerance for high energy costs And as Jimmy Carter discovered the families that carry lunch buckets hold the people in government responsible for energy shortages and price spikes President Bush himself seems to sense that energy threatens his Presidency electricity alone could be its downfall Perhaps his talent for political survival will yet cause the President to change course on electric policy and break out of the confined ideological box which he appears on the verge of entering The fate of his presidency and our energy future may hang in the balance Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other

February cgibinprintcgi Print this story cgibinprintcgi Davis Vows Plan for Edison PGE The governor says that by the end of the week he will have a strategy to help the utilities avoid bankruptcy By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders would have a plan by weeks end to avert the bankruptcy of the states two biggest utilities by trading ratepayerbacked bond money for utility assets The dropdead date is clearly Feb Davis said That is when a federal judge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison joined by Pacific Gas Electric that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumers unless a rescue plan is in place Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get control of the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give the utilities a cash infusion But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid said he did not share Davis urgency to cut a deal this week The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of what likely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent power generators sell electricity in California The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order Were not even asking Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced power generators to keep electricity flowing to California even though Edison and PGE were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California has relieved the utilities of having to buy powerat a cost to taxpayers of roughly million a day Davis meanwhile plans to announce today that California has entered into its first longterm contracts to buy power from independent generators thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets At least one firm Calpine Corp was on the verge late Monday of signing a deal to provide the state with up to megawatts for roughly years One megawatt is enough to serve roughly homes The cost could not be determined but it is believed to be slightly above the cents per kilowatthour that Davis had hoped for Clearly we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem or do something to bail us out Davis said at a Capitol news conference Monday We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship Were not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass Were going to solve it ourselves Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders this week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing a cash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable in exchange for utility assets The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help the financially hobbled companies It may sell bonds or guarantee bonds that the utilities might sell Either way the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay down their debt estimated at between billion and billion It cannot be done without assistance from the state Davis said Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid Davis supports taking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants similar to stock options The warrants could be cashed in after the utilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricity for consumers or to soften future rate hikes That state assistance no matter what form it comes in has a value Davis said It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives in return has comparable value Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future The bonds would be purchased by investors who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers By selling bonds the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers for the high prices of electricity in the first year or two But consumers will pay higher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to drop as more power plants are built In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future Davis said the state likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost of power State Treasurer Phil Angelides who will oversee the bond process said in an interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for future power purchases But he said resolving the past debts of the utilities is a tougher problem There is no magic money here Bonds require a repayment source Angelides said It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their own reorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance At the end of the day if there are some assets of value that we are interested in as a buyer that should be on the table Edison and PGE have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paid record high prices for wholesale power yet were unable to pass on the full cost of it to consumers On Monday a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edisons suit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allow the utilities to pass on the multibilliondollar cost of buying power Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek among the lawmakers most involved in the Legislatures response to the energy crisis said that if utilities win the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their power purchases consumers could be hit with an rate increase I dont think we can roll the dice and let that happen said Keeley who along with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks has been pushing for an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit However Burton the Legislatures most influential member shrugged off the Monday deadline Trial courts rule Appellate courts rule Supreme Courts rule and its three or four years down the road Burton said In other developments Monday Davis again used his emergency authority to claim million worth of contracts held by PGE shortly before they would have been taken by one of the utilitys creditors PGE had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange and the entity a sort of commodities market for electricity wanted to auction off the contracts Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday The PGE contracts will supply between and megawatts of electricity for the remainder of The price of the power will be determined in proceedings before the state Board of Control But the state may find itself paying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in the contracts Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by a creditor General ReFinancial Products Corp which contends it is owed million for early termination of a financial arrangement during the utilitys debt crisis Edison said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission to attach the account to reverse course and stop the action The account with a New York bank contains million Edison said Edison noted in the same filing that it had billion in cash on Monday but has defaulted on several million dollars worth of debt payments and has deferred payments totaling million through Monday to electricity suppliers If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity payments as they came due it would have run out of cash last Friday Edison said In contrast its parent company Edison International is paying all of its bills Shares of Edison International rose cents to close at per share Monday and PGE Corp fell cents to close at per share Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors a large credit rating agency reaffirmed that Californias strong rating remains on its Credit Watch Negative list following Thursdays passage by the Legislature of a bill giving the state Department of Water Resources million more to buy electricity for the state Californias general obligation bonds carry a rating of doubleA SP also downgraded to Dor junkbond levelthe issuer credit rating of the California Independent System Operator reflecting the fact that the utilities are no longer paying their electricity bills The downgrade does not affect any operating funds of CalISO which are generated by transmission fees and does not include debt issued by the state for CalISO which retains insured tripleA and A plus ratings See attached

AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

forward maybe SCE doesnt want any merchant obligations Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM Kathryn Corbally PM To James D nron cc Subject CaliforniA Jim Have sent you three notes that show some level of support to activity in California its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say quote the devil is in the details and quote the odds of bankruptcty remain in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

James D nron Jeff NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Cost of Protectionism Jeff In order for California to shut its doors it must open its interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue to pursue open acess This is the hard question that we need to answer Jim Alan CT PM To James D nron Jeff nron cc Susan J NRON Steve CT Mary CT Subject Cost of Protectionism Jim Jeff Jim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving from the current evolving system of open access to a protectionist environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body responding to populist pressures Here are some things to consider We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or Steve Waltons input California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state being able to meet its own demand See attached slides that show PNWCA trade Even in the winter power on a net basis flows south Limiting open access would primarily act to hold instate generators hostage this will kill incentives for new investment If the ISOs proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a protectionist ISO would go instate generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market based rate certificates load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a reserve margin This is costly it will lead to centralized planning solutions to reliability rather than more efficient market outcomes Artifical notions of just and reasonable rates on top of unreasonable reserve requirements would lead to severe reliability problems In other words if Steve Peace has his way the imports into the state will drop off signficanly There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid eg Path

nronXgate Rob CT Vince J CT Britt nronXgate Scott nronXgate Subject California Update Executive Summary If no comprehensive deal is reached by April th chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position says one Washington official Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named this official notes and one of them could easily become chairman

March PWP by Bart McGuire A B S T R A C T S Regulation and the Leverage of Local Market Power in the California Electricity Market September PWP by James B Bushnell and Frank A Wolak Regulators of electricity markets around the world continue to struggle with the problem of incentivizing generators whose output due to their location in the grid has no viable substitutes Such generators possess local market power Since these generators also compete in broader regional markets the actions taken to exploit their local market power can also effect market outcomes over larger areas In California a contract structure known as the reliability mustrun RMR contract was developed to address the problem of local market power However the contract form that was in place during created serious incentive problems We find that during the months of June through September RMR contracts had the effect of raising overall supply bid prices from most producers thereby leading to higher energy prices in the California regional market Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Electricity Markets Should the Rest of the World Adopt the UK Reforms July PWP by Catherine Wolfram Policy makers everywhere have analyzed and tried to learn from the UK electricity restructuring adopting some of the same market features but modifying others Now the British government has embarked on a radical reform of their electricity industry called the Programme to Reform the Electricity Trading Arrangements or RETA The changes to the electricity market are slated for September Some of the changes will bring the UK in line with what other countries have done but other changes will be unique Is the UK poised to leapfrog the rest of the world adopting every market feature that has proved successful and modifying those that have not Should the rest of the world be following the UKs lead on some of these changes This paper argues that the answer is a decisive no to both questions While proposed reforms to introduce demandside bidding and encourage financial innovation make sense the governments proposal to pay suppliers their bids rather than the market clearing price will not help achieve the stated goals of fostering competition and lowering prices Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Does Incentive Regulation Provide the Correct Incentives Stochastic Frontier Evidence from the US Electricity Industry September PWP by Christopher R Knittel Many policymakers are currently weighing the advantages of deregulating electricity markets over more traditional regulatory methods However within this traditional regulatory environment many options exist In particular the use of incentive regulation programs in US electricity markets has grown during the past two decades These programs differ in both their goals and how they attempt to meet these goals In this paper I discuss the wide array of programs that have been utilized and investigate the impact of individual programs on the technical efficiency of a large set of coal and natural gas generator units Within a stochastic frontier framework I allow the distribution of inefficient production to be a function of the regulatory environment the plant operates under The results suggest that while certain incentive regulations increase observed technical efficiency others have either no effect or even lead to a reduction in efficiency Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Understanding Competitive Pricing and Market Power in Wholesale Electricity Markets August PWP by Severin Borenstein Discussions of competition in restructured electricity markets have revealed many misunderstandings about the definition diagnosis and implications of market power In this paper I attempt to clarify the meaning of market power and show how it can be distinguished from competitive pricing in markets with significant shortrun supply constraints I also address two common myths about market power a that it is present in all markets and b that it must be present in order for firms to remain profitable in markets with significant fixed costs I conclude by arguing that while a finding of market power in an industry does not necessarily indicate that government intervention is warranted such analysis is an important part of creating sound public policy Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Pricing Electricity for Default Customers Pass Through or PerformanceBased Rates August PWP by Carl Blumstein California electricity consumers can choose a retail electricity service provider but most have not done so These consumers remain by default customers of the utility distribution companies UDCs Pricing electricity for these default customers is now an issue before the California Public Utilities Commission In California this issue is framed largely in terms of two alternatives pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a performancebased rate PBR Under the first alternative purchase from the California Power Exchange PX would be mandatory under the second each UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDCs performance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price This paper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the two alternatives First the paper examines the effects of the two alternatives on electricity prices The analysis suggests that at least in the near term the choice will not have much effect on prices Next the paper looks at possible perverse incentives A central concern here is that if providing default service becomes profitable UDCs might use their distribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market Finally the paper examines regulatory costs associated with the alternatives and concludes that regulatory costs are likely to be higher under a PBR Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Regulatory Imperfections in the Electricity and Natural Gas Industries Evidence from the Pricing and Investment Decisions of Single and MultiProduct Electricity Firms July PWP by Christopher R Knittel Electricity and natural gas markets have traditionally been serviced by one of two market structures In some markets electricity and natural gas are sold by a dualproduct regulated monopolist while in other markets electricity and natural gas are sold by separate singleproduct regulated monopolies This paper analyzes the relative pricing and investment decisions of electricity firms operating in the two market structures The unique relationship between these two products namely that electricity and natural gas are substitutes in consumption and natural gas is an input into the generation of electricity allows me to gain inferences regarding the efficacy of regulation in both the electricity and natural gas industries The results imply that both electricity prices and reliance on natural gas generation are higher in a dualproduct setting both suggestive that regulators respond to the relative incentives of electricity and natural gas firms Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Diagnosing Market Power in Californias Deregulated Wholesale Electricity Market July PWP by Severin Borenstein James Bushnell and Frank Wolak Effective competition in wholesale electricity markets is the cornerstone of the deregulation of the electricity generation industry We examine the degree of competition in the California wholesale electricity market during JuneNovember by comparing the market prices with estimates of the prices that would have resulted if all firms were price takers We find that there were significant departures from competitive pricing and that it was most pronounced during the highest demand periods Overall this raised the cost of power purchases by about above the competitive level We also explain why the prices observed cannot be attributed to competitive peakload pricing Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Zonal Pricing and DemandSide Bidding in the Norwegian Electricity Market June PWP by Tor Arnt Johnsen Shashi Kant Verma and Catherine Wolfram PWP analyzes prices in the dayahead electricity market in Norway We consider the hypothesis that generators are better able to exercise market power when transmission constraints bind resulting in smaller moreconcentrated markets We test this hypothesis by comparing equilibrium prices across periods with different demand elasticity and with and without binding transmission constraints We find some empirical evidence that prices in local markets are higher during constrained periods when demand is less elastic Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf Transmission Rights and Market Power November PWP by James Bushnell Stakeholders throughout the United States are currently working to reach a consensus on the structure and protocols that will define tradable transmission rights in the context of the various wholesale electricity markets and their associated Independent System Operators ISOs now forming in different regions of the US Much of the discussion has focused on the relative merits of physical transmission rights in comparison with financial transmission rights To the extent that transmission rights provide their owners with an added level of influence or control over transmission markets some of the historical industry concerns over vertical market power may need to be revisited In this paper I discuss some of the potential concerns over transmission rights and their use for the exercise of various forms of market power Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf PowerGrid Decentralization March PWP by Bart McGuire Most of the literature concerned with decentralized operations in power grids has focussed on partitioning systems initially into two main parts the transmission system and the market of users the ISO and the PX and asking how the actions of these two subgroups can be properly coordinated While a number of studies have gone on to examine decentralized operations in the user market of producers and consumers little attention has been given to how the operation of the transmission system itself might be decentralized In this paper we propose an organizational procedure for coordinating the actions of the managers of given subgrids of a larger system Noninvasive pricequantity dialogs are defined that under fairly general circumstances bring about perfect shortrun coordination of the aggregate grid Download this paper in Adobe Acrobat format uceiPDFpwppdf

in these proceedings the FERC order said The commission said it will give a threeweek deadline for parties to intervene and to comment on the possible solutions presented by the commission FERC said it anticipates issuing an order by the end of the year adopting and directing remedies to promptly address to the extent possible the identified problems adversely affecting competitive power markets

bloc ks of customers at good rates below the historic bundled rate New Powe r looks like it will win or at least share in the customers Something to think about in CA Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM PennFuture PM Please respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market November Vol No Pennsylvanias First Successful CDS Auction An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PUC over which company has won the right to provide default generation service to customers of PECO Energy an Exelon Company This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is th e fruit of the PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement a landmar k document that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed i t The peace treaty includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de fault service for of its customers and PECO has done so Green Mountain Ener gy Company is now challenging PECO Energys decision that New Power won the auction to provide the settlements mandated default service Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those consumers smal l rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources Specificall y New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service to Rate R residential customers for approximately cents per kilowatthour That offer is cents per kilowatthour less than PECO Energys unbundled generation and transmission rate of cents per kilowatthour and cents per kilowatthour less than the shopping credit of The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by th e stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy Indeed were it not for stranded cost payments the New Power and Green Mountain offers wou ld reduce total bills by about cents per kilowatthour or The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels It also shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met economicall y Finally the result of this case will switch more customers to competitive suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in California over a period of nearly three years When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner if all consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider the total number of customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil l jump to more than Of this total will be residential customers of PECO a number equal to of the PECO residential class CDS Background In Pennsylvania there must always be a default sup plier or provider of last resort to assure that service is always available to all customers The incumbent utility is the default supplier unless the PUC decides otherwise The default supplier must provide generation service to customers who do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose not to shop or did not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price The PECO Restructuring Case Settlement initially defined CDS service in paragra ph On January of all of PECOs residential customers de termined by random selection including lowincome and inabilitytopay customers a nd without regard to whether such customers are obtaining generation service from an EGS shall be assigned to a provider of last resortdefault supplier other than PECO that will be selected on the basis of a Commissionapproved energy and capacity market price bidding process This service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service CDS The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU PPL and APS restructuring cases CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas t one other large competitor in each market CDS also has a renewable portfol io standard RPS even though there is no RPS for regulated utilities in Pennsylvania The winning bidder must supply of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable re sources of solar wind sustainable biomass including landfill gas but excluding incineration of Municipal Solid Waste geothermal or ocean power The renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of thereafter This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely meaning that in year four of the CDS there will be a renewable requirement in year five and so on This is significant as each extra percent of renewable energy used to serve the customer block prevents approximately tons of NOx tons of SO and tons of CO from being emitted b y fossil fuel burning power plants PECOs CDS RFP Importantly the PECOUnicom merger case modified the CD S bidding process as established by the settlement Of particular note the revisions eliminated the customer care functions from CDS made the contract three years long to help spread out return of startup costs and instituted several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts yielded no successful CDS contract PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April and Shell Energy Services submitted the only bid However the PUC rejected the bid as nonconforming and denied Shells Petition for Reconsideration of its decision Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement PECO entered into bilateral negotiations based on an August RFP Three suppliers submitted conforming bids and PECO selected New Power as t he winner on October New Power is the new competitive supplier actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO service territory and is backed by Enron AOL and IBM PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC fo r approval on November Under the proposal PECO and New Power expand ed the size of the CDS requirement to include of nonshopping residential customers instead of of all residential customers whether shopping or not This change was designed to implement paragraph of the Restructuring Settlement requiring adjustments to the numbers assigned to CDS in order to have of all PECO residential and commercial customers obtaining competitive generation as of January There also will be a second round of assignment of nonshopping customers as of October if New Power is providing CDS to fewer than of all PECO residential customers New Power electricity will be renewable in renewable in and renewable in as required but does not include a commitment to exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the nonrenewable portion of the product The price for New Powers CDS for Rate R customers would be below the shopping credit while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay less than their shopping credit For a Rate R customer this would me an that overall rates would fall as energy and transmission falls from to for Rate RH rates would fall Customers assigned to CDS may still choose any competitive supplier or opt out and retain default servic e from PECO without penalty or charge New Power will be able to offer its fu ll slate of energy and nonenergy related products to these customers Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECONew Power contract is not in the public interest arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountains o ffer that included CDS pricing below the shopping credit for all residential customers including those on residential heating or offpeak service Like the New Power proposal the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and RH rates and respectively Green Mountain asserts that the New Power rate cut for Rate R is only and not and argues that its product i s better for the environment because the nonrenewable portion of the product would come from natural gas and hydro instead of system power generated primarily from coal and nuclear fuels If not declared the winning bidder Green Mountain proposes in the alternative that both they and New Power receive CDS contracts In response PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to subm it revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not submitted unti l October days after the deadline and nine days after the selection of New Power as the winning bidder The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November Some think tha t the PUC may very well split the customer block between Green Mounta in and New Power Whatever the result customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet another small price reduction more renewable energy and the

Meringolo Peter PM To Fergus Gary S Stephen C Hall Email cc Subject Draft letter to the CPUC Please let either Gary or me know your thoughts and comments regarding the below draft letter to the CPUC Thanks Peter PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Harvey Morris Esq California Public Utilities Commission Public Utilities Commission San Francisco California Re I Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing Inc EPMI Enron Energy Services Operations Inc and Enron Energy Services Inc collectively referred to as EES Enron Energy Marketing Corporation EEMC and Portland General Electric Corporation Portland Generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the Enron Entities Harvey I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between Michael Day on behalf of the Enron Entities and yourself during the past few weeks Here is the current status as we understand it Based upon the agreements we reached between October and October date of your confirming email the Enron Entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission the Commission October Bate Nos Enron Entities on behalf of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos October Bate Nos P on behalf of Portland General Responsive to Request Nos and November Bate No Enron Entities Diskette with EESEEMC retail data Responsive to Request Nos to to and November Bate No P Diskettes with Portland General Data which include approximate wholesale transactions Responsive to Request Nos to to and We believe with these productions we have complied with the October th agreement with respect to Portland General and EESEEMC As you know these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for EPMI as defined in our October th email available for production by October th However we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable The collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it In fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem We now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be available the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission FERC We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data Moreover during the iterim between October th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the Enron entities First we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds Second the Commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served Third the Commission has filed its motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule We note that the reasons stated in the motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the Commissions own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas Finally FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of November Originally the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available However given both the Commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate Transaction Data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commissions threatened motion to compel before FERC We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas We understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas We understand that the Commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas We deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights If you have and questions or comments

First I assume that we can enter testimony into the docket without being a witness at this hearing Second the way the hearing has two groups a good guys with facts finding the guilty and b the apologists for the guilty makes it difficult for me to know which panel I would recommend that we join Our message doesnt seek to find blame just solutions Finally given the upcoming FERC hearing why not make our case in that process where I think the witch hunt mentality wont be so high I can be persuaded otherwise on this case Either way however my assumption is that we need to work toward getting FERC informed and ready to do the right thing and manage the CPUC and other CA issues to do no harm Jim Jeff Dasovich PM To Mona L ES cc James D ES Harry ES Paul CT Susan J ES Sandra ES Mary

ES Karen nron Peggy ES Mark NRON Sarah nron Joe nron Tim CT Subject Re Comments on Wholesale Issues I spoke w Bill Julian Cmmr Woods Advisor about the hearing that is being held on Friday September in San Diego There will be a morning panel and an afternoon panel The morning panel will discuss pricing behaviorpatterns and the afternoon panel will provide explanationsrefutations of the morning presentations Im not sure yet who will be speaking but I have inquired from Steve Weisman who appears to be heading this effort Do we want an Enron representative on the panel Who would be the best witness While this investigation has the opportunity to turn into a witch hunt I am also concerned about the record being developed in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that Wood or the legislature have in mind This could mean an attempt by the Commission to assert more regulation in the market assert more state vs federal jurisdiction build a case for collapsing the ISOPX into one organization or hang blame on generators and scheduling coordinators I think Tim and Marys presentation would be very effective in showing the other real side of the story The following is an exerpt from the prehearing conference transcript held on from Cmmr Wood I am not going to sit here and say that its not an appropriate time to assign blame If there has been wrongdoing we will assign blame We will ferret out the wrongdoers and we will bring them to account to the greatest of our ability But I think that as Judge Wetzell pointed out the scope of this proceeding is quite broad We are not only addressing the immediate issues but we are also addressing the underlying problems of this market which clearly is not functioning which clearly is broken We have to look at problems with the structure of the market we have to look at problems with the behavior of market participants and getting beyond the wholesale market we have to look at the interaction with the retail market because after all thats where the pain actually occurs Thats what consumers themselves face There are probably implications for the longterm viability of Californias utilities that are connected with this proceeding and we have to get into that And for that reason as well as the fact that the other utilities in California are going to be coming out of the rate freeze at some point in the future we have to consider the statewide implications of what were doing So this is not just the San Diego proceeding although we are focused on events here in the San Diego area Mona L Petrochko PM To James D ES

for comments on the following questions by Friday September We are an individual party to the case as well as a member of ARM and WPTF This would be a good opportunity to get our version of what is wrong on the record The presentation that Tim and Mary put together for FERC will be helpful in answering these questions I will take a first cut at drafting response to be circulated by Tuesday of next week We can take liberties in providing responses that go beyond the question asked Market Structure Are the market conditions currently being experienced price spikes and suppy shortages inevitable under the current market structure Do generators andor scheduling coordinators have market power Is there a need to mitigate such market power Which market participants or other entities are responsible for reliability planning Do California regulatory agencies have adequate jurisdiction to ensure reasonable prices and reliable service Do the structures and governance of the Cal ISO and PX adequately support the goals of providing reasonably priced and reliable service Market Rules Are there rules which allow or encourage unacceptable market outcomes What roles if any do underscheduling in forward markets out of state transfers uniform PX auction prices and ISO realtime and outofmarket purchases play in the outcomes being experienced Behavior of Market Participants

Hogan piece Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the JoskowKahn analysis remember its Ed Kahn not Alfred Kahn Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan Co If in the end there aint nothing useful so be it But seems like theres little downside to exploring it Jim my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking too Ultimately may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow andor Hogan to come from economists rather than directly from us Best Jeff Forwarded by Jeff DasovichNAEnron on AM Daniel Douglass rterHaddencom AM To Roger illiamscom cc Subject From Todays Electricity Daily Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isnt going far enough in its attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market according to a paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric The paper by John D Chandley Scott M Harvey and William W Hogan argues that FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator rather than worrying about the governance of the two institutions The change in governance may help says the paper Electricity Market Reform in California but it is not likely to be decisive in the near term Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be accomplished within an acceptable time frame Hogan of the Kennedy School of Government has been writing since in opposition to Californias market separation Also argues the paper freeing the California utilities to engage in forward contracting is no panacea The expectation that merely allowing utilities to participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high prices is problematic and not supported by the commissions staff report says the analysis adding that putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts in the present environment may make things worse If the underlying problem in California is high cost and low capacity requiring forward contracting could harm not only California but also the entire Western US electric system FERCs socalled soft cap is a wild card that has the three economists scratching their heads It does not appear in the staff report and there is little critical analysis of their implications other than the discussion of Commissioner Curt Hebert If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward cost justification for bids above MWh then FERC is headed into an administrative morass that would rival those under wellhead price controls in the natural gas industry If on the other hand the soft cap is truly soft and would only require some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is eventually deemed not just and reasonable there might be little impact on consumer prices particularly if the principal sources of those high prices are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of market power Even so the proposal might serve to deter entry and new investments thus combining the worst of both worlds high consumer prices and little or no new investment FERCs proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just what constitutes market power The paper cites the proposed orders lawyerly obfuscatory conclusion that while this record does not support findings of specific exercises of market power and while we are not able to reach definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers there is clear evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the Federal Power Act The economists note In this regard the debate is confused because we are dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face In the case of California say the economists there is no evidence of market power Even the practice of generators avoiding the dayahead market in favor of the realtime market is a response to bad market design and pricing incentives including price caps but does not demonstrate the exercise of market power Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of market power they add The distinction between direct marginal cost and opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion Hence a competitive bidder whose direct cost of generation is but who

to seek our support for their restructuring MOU before the California Assembly and the CPUC Steve Kean has asked that I get together a phone call to discuss this proposal and our potential wish list that would be necessary for SCE to earn our support I would like to set up a call for tomorrow at Houston time The callin number is Code for US parties Here is my initial proposal for Enrons list Full payment of PX Credit to ESP receivable and going forward from st Tranche of Securitization agree to dismiss PX Credit compliant at CPUC Transmission network operated by Westwide RTO not California ISO roll Cal ISO into larger RTO OR maybe push for TransElect buying Clear language on continuation of Direct Access with clarity on Surcharg e Full payment to EWC on all charges receivable and going forward from st Tranche of Securitization BackUp transaction to Transmission Sale D SCE should offer the market including the State the ability to buy the Hydro facilities Im sure there are others Maybe we want to be involved in a QF restructuring deal The plan is for Enron to try and respond to SCE by Friday no later than Monday Please call me if there are any questions at Jim PS For those who dont have the MOU here is a brief overview The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California Edison Memorandum of Understanding Commitment to Provide Power SCE will keep its current generation pla nts and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated costofservice basis for years Dedication of Power Edison International will commit the entire outp ut of Sunrise one of Edison Internationals nonregulated generating faciliti es to the State on a fixed price basis for years Phase I of Sunrise is to be brought online by August If not brought online by August Edison International shall be assessed a million penalty Transmission Sale SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets for approximately billion times the net book value of the assets subject to certain adjustments Of the billion the billion gain on sale will be used to reduce SCEs net undercollected amount as of Ja nuary In connection with the purchase the State will also assume certa in liabilities associated with the transmission assets Backup Transaction If the transmission sale does not occur within tw o years for reasons beyond the parties control then if the State elects SCE shall sell to the State SCEs hydro generation assets If the hydro asse ts are not worth billion then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe r enough belowmarketpricepower to make up the shortfall Conservation Property SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen ts to the State covering approximately acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr ic related lands and acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related lands Some of the land may be deeded in fee Contribution by Edison International Edison International will refun d to SCE not less than million This money will

attributable to QFs not selling to SCE due to SCEs fa ilure to pay the QFs SCE will securitize this amount Securitization SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou nt approx billion The securitization shall occur in two tranches i e two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the signing of the definitive

transmission sale does not occur within two years Accordingly the second tranche would not show up in rates for two years if at all Buying the Net Short The State will be required to buy the net short through December After SCE will be responsible for covering the net short Investment Recovery SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that will not drop below its current rte during the year cost of service ratemaking period Next Steps Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action Definitive Agreements Once the MOU is signed the next stage is to negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the transmission sale as well as the specific terms of the various other relat ed agreements eg the OM Agreement Transmission Services Agreement and th e Facilities Services Agreement CPUC Action Prior to entering into the definitive agreements the CP UC must undertake certain actions which include establishing mechanisms for preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs

Legislation what used to be ABX Wright Here is a note from Mike Florio of the ISO Board This is encouraging he wants to talk further about how the ISO programs can be changed to accomplish what we want What would be most helpful is an item by item analysis by EES read Harry and his people as to why the existing or proposed ISO programs are inadequate or why we need to have X amended to have the ISO do programs for direct access customers parallel to the utility programs in X I need this information soon in order to keep the dialogue going with Florio Thanks for your help Mike Day Original Message From Mike Florio mailto Sent Wednesday March PM To MDay Subject Re Demand Bidding Legislation what used to be ABX Wright Just to show how up to speed I am I thought that the ISO was already planning to do this Their presentation on demand programs at the last board meeting showed a scheduling coordinator option and a UDC option with different billing and settlement provisions for each But its hard for me to judge what is adequate and userfriendly and what is not absent some expert help Im definitely interested in the concept and have no great faith in utility management of programs of this nature Lets pursue MIKE PS In his own inimitable way Dan Richard offered me the ORA job way back when I said Gee Dan I thought we were friends When he acted all surprised and hurt in that way of his I reminded him that Marty Lyons and Mark Loy come with the turf End of discussion At PM you wrote Mike I wanted your reaction to a proposal we were making in response to the Wright X bill on demand bidding programs We strongly support these programs and feel that ESPs can bring a lot of benefit to the program by aggregaring customers educating them on the benefits of bidding Negawatts and helping to meter and verify their load reductions We are certain that we could help enroll more customers in the program than if the utilities alone were in charge So we proposed language for X which allowed ESPs to aggregate customers in the utility day ahead and hour ahead programs and proposed an additional day ahead program based on economic value not reliability criteria like reserve margins The utilities and the large customers wanted to clarify that we would not include direct access customers in the utility programs because of the odd funding source reductions from the amounts paid to DWR We agreed with the concept we dont want to fund demand reduction programs for Direct Access customers through DWR payments but we also feel strongly that there should be similar nondiscriminatory demand reduction programs for all types of customers including DA So we came up with the idea of inserting language in the bill to require the ISO to institute demand bidding programs which match the ones mandated in the bill for the IOUs I gave our suggestion to Robin Larson and I dont imagine youve seen it yet but would you give me your reaction to the basic concept I looked at the ISO website and tried to evaluate the demand bidding programs already in placewith a limited amount of understanding but Enrons business folks indicated that they did not consider the existing programs to be the equivalent of what the utilities will be implementing If that is so how about putting similar programs in place so we can actively market and encourage all customers to bid their negawatts especially the economic bid and contract in advance deals so that the ISO can count on the demand reductions in advance of a days operations I await your response I am so sorry you are not the next ORA director I was certain you would be appointed to that too gallows humor Mike Day

cc Phillip K CT Tim CT Mike CT Tim CT Vince J CT Rob CT Kevin M CT Claudio nronXgate Richard nron James D nron Mark nronXgate Scott nronXgate Britt nronXgate Subject California Update Executive Summary The as yet unnumbered rescue bill by Davis made it to the Senate floor An exemption of the gasfired QFs from this bill as proposed by Sen Keeley could further forestall an involuntary bankruptcy filing If passed the draft CPUC order would give the utilities another days after rate hikes to pay the QFs The negotiations with the QFs are complicated by the issue of payments owed by the utilities to the DWR Senators are demanding that the utilities set up a trust fund from rate revenues to pay back the DWR The CalEnergy ruling as reported by Bloomberg this PM is an attractive option for other QFs looking to at least temporarily escape longterm supply contracts with Edison If neither the CPUC nor the legislature exempts the gasfired generators from the new rate structure an immediate involuntary bankruptcy filing is expected However if the exemption is implemented then a bankruptcy filing would be delayed QF Bill Makes it to Senate Floor The CPUC bill the number is not yet known is in mockup form and does the following Repeals PUC Code section which set a formula for QFs under deregulation Amends portions of AB X which will ensure that DWR receives money for its power purchases and includes provisions for the issuance of bonds Includes a provision for SDGE rates since they were not covered under other legislation The bill passed the Senate Energy and also just passed the Senate Appropriations Committee and is headed to the Senate Floor Senator Comments on the Bill Keeley author of bill presented that the bill would allow the PUC to decide the QF contracts which is the proper authority to debate the issue Most of the opposition to this portion of the bill was regarding the fact that the bill provides no guidance to the PUC regarding voided costs for natural gasfired QFs Republicans offered an amendment to not have section repealed for gasfired generators but Keeley had concerns with the amendment Keeley stated that he did not think they should limit the PUCs flexibility and that as drafted the amendment was too broad He also indicated that gasfired utilities have a legitimate issue with the draft order He said that the PUC order needs to be amended and Keeley is confident that the PUC has recognized that in discussion over the past hours Opponents to the QF Bill The following people testified in opposition to QF portion TURN Delta Power QF Syke Energy John Hancock Financial California Manufacturers Association Crockett Cogeneration Independent Energy Producers Clean Power Campaign PGE SCE The gasfired QFs that testified in opposition noted that they have been offline for a couple of months and cannot come back online unless their issues are addressed In response to the QFs not getting paid Sen Bowen stated that if the utilities do not pay the QFs as directed under the draft order then she would personally see to it that they go into bankruptcy PGE and SCE Testimony Sen Battin asked both utilities about the draft order which states that after the change in the rates by QFs the utilities must pay the QFs within days and whether the utilities would abide by the order PGEs response was that they are receiving million per month the cost of their own generation is million and the QF amount is million per month the draft order would lower the QF cost to million PGE was cut off at this point and asked point blank whether their answer to Battins question was yes or no Battin Bowen and Murray all asked whether it was yes or no The PGE rep stated that it would be no if the issue of the payments owed to ISO and DWR is not resolved If the ISO costs of purchases were included in the DWR payments then PGE would not have a problem The SCE response was that if the money coming in was less than the money going out then it could not comply with the PUC order Payments to DWR Senator Sher then asked both utilities regarding a requirement under AB X that the utilities set aside those moneys that are owed to the DWR for purchasing power that they collect from ratepayers in a trust fund those SCE responded that they are still in negotiations with DWR on the terms and conditions Several legislators responded angrily that this was not part of the bill and that they should have a trust fund set up PGE noted that they are setting some money aside but would not state how much Sen Sher ended the conversation by stating that if the utilities do not set up a trust fund by tomorrow they would either pass emergency legislation or go after them for violating the law X Provisions Tim Gage from Dept of Finance noted the Governors support of the entire bill and noted that the X provisions would ensure that DWR gets paid PGE also testified in opposition to these provisions Senator Bowen made the following statements Senator Peace has announced that he has received another notice of million appropriation needed to purchase power and will not approve the funding unless PGE and SCE drop their challenge to the PUC regarding the DWR issue Also stated that the PUC could always raise rates as a way to resolve the issue

efficiency will translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most and beyond Governor Davis said With these grants in place California will continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand responsive building systems technology Demand responsive building systems work by using software that automatically dim lights reduce air conditioning use and cut other electrical loads They operate in response to signals from the Independent System Operator ISO or from an electric utility or service provider Under the agreements commercial electricity customers will agree to shave peak loads by to percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their buildings in real time In addition to these grants the Governor also announced that an additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to the KMart Corporation KMart will use a million grant to replace old lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its California stores The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables program covering the KMart grant are parts of AB which was passed last year The bill is designed to reduce at least megawatts of peak load by June The Governor has proposed an additional million in his New Demand Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional megawatts in savings from demand responsive building systems

nronXgate Rob CT Vince J CT Britt nronXgate Scott nronXgate Subject California Update Executive Summary If no comprehensive deal is reached by April th chances of bankruptcy increase due to a one day optout clause in all longterm power contracts PGE and State locked in tough negotiations several issues on the table PUCimposed requirement forcing PGE to ultimately be responsible for California energy supplies Price of the grid state times book value vs PGE times book value PGE will not use any of the B secured last week to help their ailing utility Daviss announcement of long term power contract didnt include some details Of the megawatts secured this far only are available this summer Some of the long term contracts are really only for three months None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot market One the same day Davis announced long term contracts Davis also quietly announce a rate hike FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal PGE Transmissions deal One thing that is still uncertain is PGE Bankruptcy may still be a likely alternative if current negotiations to buy PGEs share of the electric transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April when all longterm power contracts being negotiated have a oneday optout clause they can exercise unilaterally if a comprehensive solution has not been reached by the state and its major utilities According to sources close to senior PGE officials PGE made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal on the transmission lines depends on the California governments willingness to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make until now PGE will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to relieve it of the PUCimposed requirement to be the electricity buyer of last resort Current state regulations make the utility companies ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all times to supply Californias energy needs As long as the state steps in and makes those purchases as it has for the past three months the utilities are shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings But PGE officials are worried this summers supply and Daviss concern over how fast he is draining the states budget surplus If things get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state will pay only for the electricity it buys through longterm contracts then PGE will be left holding the bag Thus as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid PGE is demanding a comprehensive solution that includes not being liable for cost differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed to pay State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of get out of jail free card so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough negotiations that are complicated by three other factors PGEs public behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy State legislative demands that the price Davis negotiate for PGEs part of the electricity grid be no more than times revenues from the grid and the FERC must positively approve any grid purchase by the state of California The principal concern on the price front is that PGE wants to sell the electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their transmission while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the politically acceptable limit We see times book value as an absolute upper bound There is no way PGE will get more than that whatever they think according to the leader of one main consumer groups We are going to try to force any deals down to about in any case Negotiators for Davis are also trying to propositionproof any transmission deal to protect against a later ballot proposal They think there are ways to do that but not if the price of PGEs part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative Remember if Daviss eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative he will be running for reelection on the same ballot as a public initiative designed to overturn his solution On the Sacramento front no one understands PGEs motives The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game PGE is playing In a three day period PGE made a series of announcements that left everyone scratching their heads Late Thursday PGE officials leaked information to California papers that they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity transmission grid to the state which seemed like obvious good news but then made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least above what the state was currently offering While a deal can still be done anything like the billion PGE wants would be very hard to get through the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase Late Friday PGE officials announced that they had secured a billion loan for the parent company not the electricity utility and would use the money to pay off bondholders other creditors and to return million to shareholders in a new dividend payout Not a cent of that money was earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PGE and that left at least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood Over the weekend PGE leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay off its energy suppliers debt for cents on the dollar right now For generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will make them whole in a couple of months that kind of trial balloon is extremely unnerving Thus in a very short time period PGEs corporate owners showed they could access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the energy crisis Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at least a part of the billion debt they have accumulated since last summer and PGEs fundraising will harden and deepen those demands As one senior political official told our source just when you think the corporate leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible they come up with something even more outrageous PGEs actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to construct to solve Californias problems State Democrats doubt they will get Republican support for a deal which means a vote will fall short of the twothirds majority necessary for immediate enactment resulting in days for the legislation to go into effect Additionally in the past hours many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the electricity grid Longterm Contracts Davis didnt tell the whole truth Yesterday Davis announced that he had signed longterm power deals for megawatts of power out of a total megawatts he wanted to sign eventually According to the press release Davis is now of the way toward his longterm goal and has already solved the hardest part of Californias energy crisis This means consumers would maybe pay more than necessary five years from now but these contracts guaranteed that consumers would pay less for the next three years What Davis failed to highlight was that of the megawatt commitment actually only megawatts are available this summer when demand is expected to megawatts and some of these longterm contracts are actually only good for three months None of these contracts however keep California from having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year While the media was concern with Daviss announcement of long term contracts for California of less concern to the media was Daviss quietly announced a decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers The state will accept the emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a permanent increase as well as an additional increase for consumers that will take effect early when the old rate cut legislation expires That would bring the average charge to about cents a kilowatt hour FERC The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve it in a positive vote Senior California officials and legislators doubt that FERC has jurisdiction and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal But they may be wrong The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs off on the deal Its power over transmission deal is absolute no matter what anyone says according to source close to the President There are three possibilities FERC could pocket veto it by not even putting it on agenda for discussion the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted down The Democrat on the commission William Massey has already said he is opposed to it or the Commission could approve it but with condition that Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system One complicating factor in the FERC decision however is that its chairman Curt Hebert who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale may not be around long enough to have his say Hebert is definitely not a shoo in for the FERC chairman position says one Washington official Two other appointments to the Commission will soon be named this official notes and one of them could easily become chairman

Steves qualitative analysis Good to have before we fight this out at FERC If someone internal can do it great Thoughts Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Steve CT PM To Jeff NRON cc Alan CT James D nron Jeff NRON Mary CT Paul CT Richard nron Susan J NRON Subject Re Cost of Protectionism Jeff In order for California to shut its doors it must open its interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texaslike electrical island This they cannot do California has a substantial investment in units located in Nevada Arizona New Mexico and Utah The lights would go out in California if they opened the ties In the s there was a hue and cry over loop flow with California claiming that it was being injured by others particularly by the interior systems trading practices however they never considered opening the ties because the benefits of interconnection were so large that the cost of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of regional trade ie they are economically interdependent If such a foolish thing were done and California full closed its doors by opening its ties cost would go up in the Northwest in California and all the rest of the Western System There are gains for trade which accrue to all parties from interconnection The trade is more complicated than just summerwinter peaks seasonal load diversity there is also seasonal resource diversity Spring run off effects and finally there opportunity to capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations I will address the last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns The interior west Montana Wyoming Utah Arizona and New Mexico has large amount of base load coal plants As load drops off in those areas the energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California This can be seen in the attached file which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on the Pacific DC Intertie Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun Dec Jun In these plots the clear daynight exchange of energy can be seen especially in the Jun plot when sales are being made to California in the day and to the Northwest at night This day to night storage exchange benefits lowers costs for everyone On top of this dailyweekly cycle there is the seasonal shift in load diversity you noted For the Northwest its peak load occurs when energy production is the lowest during the winter As a stand alone system the Pacific Northwest ie the Columbia Drainage area is energy constrained The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak but not enough to total water flow Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana eg Colstrip and Bridger are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual energy requirement With these energy inputs from the coal fields the seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro system although fish navigation irrigation etc impose an increasing number of constraints Energy imports from in the winter from the South help to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until the snow pack is better know in early Spring Some of the sales to the Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties to the Northwest Finally the Spring run offfish flush when production on the river is at a maximum and load in the Northwest is down The sale of these surpluses paid for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned to take advantage of this factor Again both California and the Northwest benefit from this trade In all cases the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and everyone was on their own The Northwest may be capacity long but it is typically energy short even in flush hydro years The winter energy imports from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the South lower energy costs in California California cannot craft a solo solution that ignores the rest of the West It is probably hard to decide who would be worst off if California closed its doors It is only clear that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from which it divorced itself I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise Steve Jeff NRON Sent by Jeff NRON AM To James D nron cc Alan CT Mary CT Steve CT Susan J NRON Richard nron Paul CT Subject Re Cost of Protectionism To Jims last point I understand that the good ol utility system was often operated with little regard for basic economic principles but theres something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess and it seems to always be tied to this notion that California is a net importer even in the winter Im going to start with the economics and then let folks describe why it seemingly doesnt apply in Western electricity markets Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion If California closes its doors the other Western states will pay higher prices for power andor face increased threats to reliability Im struggling to try to determine why these basic principles arent applicable to Western power markets I understand that the PNW is a very complex place and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has developed over the years To keep it simple though not necessarily accurate Ive confined the analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist The basic situation The PNW peaks in the winter California peaks in the summer Lets take two scenarios The West less California is so awash in electricity that even in its peakthe Winterit still has power to send to California ie it has so overbuilt its system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California Irrespective there have to my limited knowledge always been sales from CA to the PNW during the winter when the PNW is peaking The only conclusion that one can make assuming that the PNW is awash in electricity is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes economic sense to do so That is during the winter peaking months it must be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than produce itself Otherwise its difficult to understand why it would buy from California during this month particularly if theyre long As such at a minimum the PNWs electric bill will necessarily increase if California closes its doors Neither the PNW nor California has indigenous capacity to meet peaking load Therefore the PNW must buy Californias power during its peaking summer period and California must buy power during its summer peaking period In this case not only will the PNWs bill go up if California closes its doors the lights are likely to go because theyll be short power I realize that this is a simplistic model and that there could be other legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW eg transmission costs And again I also realize that economics may not have traditionally been a driver in the industry But I thought it might be useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the question that Jim asks With that Ill pose the question understanding the simplicity of the model set forth above Given that California sends power northeven if the PNW is longhow can California closing it doors not increase the PNWs cost of power Best Jeff James D Steffes AM To Alan CT cc Jeff nron Mary CT Steve CT Susan J nron Subject Re Cost of Protectionism It seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value of an open transmission network is that California does not have to build MW of power plant MW max input in state In other words if California were to disconnect from the grid someone would have to build additional power plants instate The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of MW plants made even more expensive after California expropriates the current fleet of merchant generation From the perspective of the remainder of the West the question still remains if California does go it alone what is the economic impact Other than legal arguments about Interstate Commerce why should the Federal Government want to continue to pursue open acess This is the hard question that we need to answer Jim Alan CT PM To James D nron Jeff nron cc Susan J NRON Steve CT Mary CT Subject Cost of Protectionism Jim Jeff Jim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of moving from the current evolving system of open access to a protectionist environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political body responding to populist pressures Here are some things to consider We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara or Steve Waltons input California is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the state being able to meet its own demand See attached slides that show PNWCA trade Even in the winter power on a net basis flows south Limiting open access would primarily act to hold instate generators hostage this will kill incentives for new investment If the ISOs proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where a protectionist ISO would go instate generators would be required to sell forward or lose their market based rate certificates load serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and a reserve margin This is costly it will lead to centralized planning solutions to reliability rather than more efficient market outcomes Artifical notions of just and reasonable rates on top of unreasonable reserve requirements would lead to severe reliability problems In other words if Steve Peace has his way the imports into the state will drop off signficanly There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid eg Path than the current system Although admittedly the current system has flaws The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmission expansion planning Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake

in the range Note am EST Feb ABN AMRO Inc FordDaniel F CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to Go One Down Two to Go ABN AMRO Research Notes Subject Power Companies Mentioned CPN DYN EIX PCG SRE Analyst Daniel F Ford CFA Po Cheng CFA Date February Highlights On Friday Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial recovery package He also commented that good progress was made with Sempra Energy and some progress with PGE Corp The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edisons transmission system for approximately billion x estimated book value and allow for the securitization of a substantial portion of its undercollection In exchange Edison would make payments of approximately million to its utility subsidiary Southern California Edison commit the entire output of an Edison Mission project at costbased rates for years provide costbased rates from native generation for another years give conservation easements on acreas of watershed lands for years and drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission We view this agreement as a positive development Based on the x purchase price the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would be approximately lower than our worst case estimate at x of The agreement however is not final and additional details need to be worked out before being submitted to the legislature Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include a definitive agreement with Edison deals with PGE Corp and Sempra Energy a package that the legislature can accept which could include concessions from generators and terms that are acceptable by the FERC In our opinion the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis While our optimism is tempered by the shortening timeframe we are encouraged by the governors recent statements which have been more positive than negative As such we maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PGE Corp as well as on the generation companies Calpine and Dynegy Other News In other related news on Friday Edison announced that all of its banks have agreed to extend their forbearance until March Note pm EST Feb Goldman Sachs NEWYORK EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EIX Goldman Sachs Co Investment Research EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov DavisPCG still negotiatingBuy EI On February EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow for recovery of a substantial portion of unrecovered cost in return for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping pending litigation This settlement appears to be a reasonable shared pain scenario and is consistent with the buyout vs bailout structure we have been anticipating To be enacted the deal needs to be finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature FERC also must approve the asset sale EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the state of California for billion and transfer million cash to its utility subsidiary from the parent In return the state would allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its undercollected power costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate hikes If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this agreement in concert with passage of ABX would eliminate the overhang that has depressed EIX shares Although dependent on several factors we believe the net impact on earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX stock price implies We believe postsettlement EPS in will likely total at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X EPS a valuation discount to the peer group Also late last week PCG issued a press release indicating they had met with the Governor had submitted proposals and discussions were ongoing With the framework already established for EIX we expect a PCG settlement could be announced in the near future PCGs negotiating flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates are lower their underrecovered balance is higher and the potential cash refund from parent to subsidiary being requested by the government is probably larger PCGs transmission system has a book value of roughly billion At X book value these assets could potentially be worth billion Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the one proposed for EIX we estimate PCG would refund million PCGs stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied by a settlement of this nature We believe a deal like this would support postsettlement EPS of at least share which supports a conservative valuation of share X eps a valuation discount to the peer group Because EIX has a deal in principle the stock is trading at a premium to PCG despite having lower potential earnings power Those investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in structure and proportional to EIXs settlement should purchase PCG over EIX at this juncture NOTE am EST Feb Merrill Lynch SFleishman EIX PCG UTILITIESELECTRICCalifornia One Goes Forward But Need All Three MLMLML Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research MLMLML UTILITIES ELECTRIC California One Goes Forward But Need All Three Steven I Fleishman Reason for Report Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison PGE up in the air Need all utilities to move forward Investment Highlights o On Friday Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison International EIX D on a financial resuscitation plan The plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor o The state will purchase Edisons transmission assets for B or x book value This would help pay off some of Edisons net B of undercollections a number agreed upon with the Gov The remainder will be recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be carvedout of Edisons rates o In exchange Edison will agree to Drop the lawsuit against the PUC Invest M back into the utility from the parent representing tax overcollections and Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost based rates for the next years Edison also agreed to sell power from its unregulated Sunrise plant currently under construction at costbased rates for years o A number of uncertainties remain in Edisons deal and it is still preliminary The exact terms and language will be very important particularly given the need to issue securitization bonds It is impossible to provide exact earnings guidance based on this deal but the only loss of earnings power would appear to come from lost transmission earnings share and potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of costbased rates o This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CA power credit crisis However it could be for naught if the other utilities cannot work out deals We believe Sempra Energy SRE B is relatively close but PGEs PCG D talks were flailing last week We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board o We believe PGE is willing to work a deal within this framework However the simple problem is that PCGs undercollection numbers are much bigger At YE PCGs net undercollection was more than B and we believe this may have reached B by the end of January Selling the transmission for x book would provide only B leaving the other half to be recovered though the dedicated rate componentsecuritization It may be that the only way the numbers can work is with a rate increase Despite the significant hurdles that remain we believe the momentum toward a constructive outcome is improving To that end we maintain our Accumulate ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts

Executive Order on expediting siting and maximizing output I have asked Mary to try and identify the of MWs that may be impacted by these actions Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mary Schoen PM To Steven J nron James D nron Richard nron Leslie nron Robert nron Sandra nron Jeffrey NRON Michael NRON Stacey nron Heather ES Robert nron Harry nron Jeff nron Susan J NRON cc Subject Summary and Very Brief Analysis of Governor Daviss Executive Orders Below is a brief summary of the five Executive Orders issued by Governor Davis on For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities Centralize Authority andor Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and Construction The tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity ie the carrot and the stick They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept of Water Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be How much capacity is truly idling and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner D Increased OutputExpedited Siting Mandates CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators limited to less than MWs using existing installed capacity bw Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants Action by the State Water Resources Control Board to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating Requirements for the State Dept of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power Expires unless extended Analysis This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity It does not waive air quality requirements they are addressed in a separate order D Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation Requirements ISO Requirements Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen below performance benchmarks est by the ISO Requires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISOs ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est benchmarks for availability and performance and issue fines against those plants after a hearing Analysis Again the tone of this order is that the state wont tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where offline for maintenance at the same time D Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation Measures Mandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits If air districts do not comply the Board CARB shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districts The Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept of Water Resources CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a percent reduction In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located Expires unless extended Analysis This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful However it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level D Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved Powerplants Expedites review and approval of postcertification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control postcertifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification and for the construction phase of the project Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification Expires unless extended Analysis Again no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner D Accelerating the Availability of New Generation Sources Requires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission under MWs and that are proposed to be on line by summer Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months shall apply to any proposed simplecycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August and that have an application for certification complete by Dec Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within days of receipt of completed application Expires unless extended Analysis This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units

AM To Ricky Lynn nron John nron Laine A PowellENRON NRONDEVELOPMENT Peter E nron Ray RANSREDES Doug RANSREDES cc Subject Dave Barrys thoughts on CAs electrical storage Feb PM The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite By DAVE BARRY When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California our reaction as concerned Americans is Ha ha No seriously we are alarmed Because history teaches us that whatever happens to California smog road rage tofu coffee that is mainly air cell phones the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive Shirley MacLaine people taking inline skating seriously grandmothers sporting new and flagrantly inappropriate bosoms eventually happens to the rest of the nation Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage and see if we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and change the subject Our first question is What exactly is electricity When we look in our Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia we see that electricity is defined as a class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge and from the interaction of charges What does this mean in laypersons terms It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big fat dope Because we know from our juniorhighschool science training that electricity is actually a fastmoving herd of electrons which are tiny onecelled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside a doubleA battery where they die within minutes Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited This was proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during a thunderstorm and was almost killed Encouraged by this success Franklin went on to conduct many more electrical experiments including rolling a hoop in a thunderstorm playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing somersaults in a thunderstorm Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm leaving the authorities with no choice but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France Nevertheless Franklin had proved an important scientific point which is that electricity originates inside clouds There it forms into lightning which is attracted to the earth by golfers After entering the ground the electricity hardens into coal which when dug up by power companies and burned in big ovens called generators turns back into electricity which is sent in the form of volts also known as watts or rpm for short through special wires with birds sitting on them to consumers homes where it is transformed by TV sets into commercials for beer which passes through the consumers and back into the ground thus completing what is known as a circuit But enough technical talk The problem is that California is running out of electricity The situation is so bad that in some hospitals they dont have enough electricity to power those electricshock paddles that get peoples hearts started again instead the doctors and nurses have to hold hands scuff their feet across the carpet in unison then shout CLEAR as they touch the patients chest Who is responsible for Californias electricity shortage You could blame the power companies or you could blame environmental wackos or you could blame the entertainment industry which uses more than billion watts of electricity per day just to blowdry the hair of the cast of Dawsons Creek or you could blame why not the Firestone tire company But you would be wrong Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity shortage is college students I base this statement on widespread observation of my son who is a college student and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium If my son is in a room then every electrical device within yards of that room every light computer television stereo video game microwave oven etc will be running My son doesnt even have to turn the devices on they activate themselves spontaneously in response to his presence Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in California which according to my research is EDITOR Please insert number of college students in California and you see my point which is EDITOR Please insert my point The question is What can the rest of us do to help our fellow countrypersons in California The answer is that we can send them our spare electricity Just imagine what would happen if all the households in this great and generous nation got out their extension cords and connected them together forming a giant electrical chain of helping across the fruited plain to the Golden State Millions of people would be turned into generous smoking lumps of carbon thats what So maybe we should

February cgibinprintcgi Print this story cgibinprintcgi Davis Vows Plan for Edison PGE The governor says that by the end of the week he will have a strategy to help the utilities avoid bankruptcy By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS Times Staff Writers SACRAMENTOGov Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders would have a plan by weeks end to avert the bankruptcy of the states two biggest utilities by trading ratepayerbacked bond money for utility assets The dropdead date is clearly Feb Davis said That is when a federal judge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison joined by Pacific Gas Electric that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumers unless a rescue plan is in place Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get control of the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give the utilities a cash infusion But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton DSan Francisco who argues that California should take control of the transmission grid said he did not share Davis urgency to cut a deal this week The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of what likely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent power generators sell electricity in California The Bush administration insists it will not extend the order Were not even asking Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced power generators to keep electricity flowing to California even though Edison and PGE were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California has relieved the utilities of having to buy powerat a cost to taxpayers of roughly million a day Davis meanwhile plans to announce today that California has entered into its first longterm contracts to buy power from independent generators thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets At least one firm Calpine Corp was on the verge late Monday of signing a deal to provide the state with up to megawatts for roughly years One megawatt is enough to serve roughly homes The cost could not be determined but it is believed to be slightly above the cents per kilowatthour that Davis had hoped for Clearly we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem or do something to bail us out Davis said at a Capitol news conference Monday We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship Were not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass Were going to solve it ourselves Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislative leaders this week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing a cash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable in exchange for utility assets The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help the financially hobbled companies It may sell bonds or guarantee bonds that the utilities might sell Either way the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay down their debt estimated at between billion and billion It cannot be done without assistance from the state Davis said Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid Davis supports taking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants similar to stock options The warrants could be cashed in after the utilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricity for consumers or to soften future rate hikes That state assistance no matter what form it comes in has a value Davis said It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives in return has comparable value Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future The bonds would be purchased by investors who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers By selling bonds the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers for the high prices of electricity in the first year or two But consumers will pay higher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to drop as more power plants are built In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future Davis said the state likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost of power State Treasurer Phil Angelides who will oversee the bond process said in an interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for future power purchases But he said resolving the past debts of the utilities is a tougher problem There is no magic money here Bonds require a repayment source Angelides said It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their own reorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance At the end of the day if there are some assets of value that we are interested in as a buyer that should be on the table Edison and PGE have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paid record high prices for wholesale power yet were unable to pass on the full cost of it to consumers On Monday a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edisons suit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allow the utilities to pass on the multibilliondollar cost of buying power Assemblyman Fred Keeley DBoulder Creek among the lawmakers most involved in the Legislatures response to the energy crisis said that if utilities win the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their power purchases consumers could be hit with an rate increase I dont think we can roll the dice and let that happen said Keeley who along with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg DSherman Oaks has been pushing for an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit However Burton the Legislatures most influential member shrugged off the Monday deadline Trial courts rule Appellate courts rule Supreme Courts rule and its three or four years down the road Burton said In other developments Monday Davis again used his emergency authority to claim million worth of contracts held by PGE shortly before they would have been taken by one of the utilitys creditors PGE had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange and the entity a sort of commodities market for electricity wanted to auction off the contracts Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday The PGE contracts will supply between and megawatts of electricity for the remainder of The price of the power will be determined in proceedings before the state Board of Control But the state may find itself paying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in the contracts Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by a creditor General ReFinancial Products Corp which contends it is owed million for early termination of a financial arrangement during the utilitys debt crisis Edison said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission to attach the account to reverse course and stop the action The account with a New York bank contains million Edison said Edison noted in the same filing that it had billion in cash on Monday but has defaulted on several million dollars worth of debt payments and has deferred payments totaling million through Monday to electricity suppliers If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity payments as they came due it would have run out of cash last Friday Edison said In contrast its parent company Edison International is paying all of its bills Shares of Edison International rose cents to close at per share Monday and PGE Corp fell cents to close at per share Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange Standard Poors a large credit rating agency reaffirmed that Californias strong rating remains on its Credit Watch Negative list following Thursdays passage by the Legislature of a bill giving the state Department of Water Resources million more to buy electricity for the state Californias general obligation bonds carry a rating of doubleA SP also downgraded to Dor junkbond levelthe issuer credit rating of the California Independent System Operator reflecting the fact that the utilities are no longer paying their electricity bills The downgrade does not

task for not getting more competition into the electricity markets Jim Forwarded by James D SteffesNAEnron on AM PennFuture PM Please respond to PennFuture To UndisclosedRecipientmailmanenroncom cc Subject PennFutures Ecubed Breaking Out of the Box PennFutures Ecubed is a commentary biweekly email publication concerning the current themes and trends in the energy market February Vol No Breaking Out of the Box Two weeks after his inauguration President Bushs electricity policy is already emerging from the crucible of California and is characterized by obedience to free market ideology and a federalism that confines the federal government to a limited backseat role We are told that Californias crisis is an isolated event the result of Californias unique mistakes In this view the federal government neither contributed to the crisis nor has a major role to play in solving it Wholesale market caps at any level are declared to be an inappropriate intrusion into free markets that can only make things worse Moreover the appointment of Curt Hebert as the new Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC signals that FERC will not assert itself to ensure that wholesale electricity markets are genuinely competitive and that the principles of open access and comparability are more than legal fictions Finally environmental regulation is fingered as a primary obstacle to adequate supplies and reasonable prices This emerging policy begins with a misdiagnosis In fact the mess in California and the West has roots in huge policy mistakes made by both the state and federal governments One such federal mistake was a FERC decision that blocked a competitive solicitation for megawatts of new generation in California Skyrocketing retail electric prices in more and more states due to wholesale market failure will soon make clear to all that the nations electricity problems start in Washington DC with failed wholesale market policies The hot seat will then shift from Governor Gray Davis to federal officials and it will become apparent that strict obedience to free market ideology or a limited role for federal authority will notcurepast mistakes in electric policy President Bush inherits an America where wholesale electricity markets are isolated and dysfunctional ticking time bombs planted beneath his Presidency The fuses on these bombs were lit with the passage of the Energy Policy Act EPACT in which deregulated the price of generation in the wholesale electric market but left FERC with the job of creating a genuinely competitive wholesale market which would restrain prices through competitive pressures But neither FERC nor Congress has ensured the free movement of electricity in interstate commerce or workably competitive markets since the passage of EPACT Market power abuses are rife and most parts of the country dont even have the benefit of an independent system operator to ensure nondiscrimination and open access to the transmission grids Even so FERC will not compel formation of or utility membership in independent system operators Worse yet in the face of opposition from states and several powerful utilities Congress has fiddled its thumbs on national restructuring legislation for five years and has not required a transition to retail competition in every state By failing to open retail markets Congress has ensured that wholesale electricity markets cannot be effectively disciplined by demand changes or longterm retail contracts Meanwhile states behave as if they are electric islands immune from the results of failed federal stewardship of wholesale markets Foolishly they have become a principal stumbling block to optimally sized regional power markets and encourage FERC timidity by banging the drums of states rights on Capitol Hill To this day with megawatts under its control PJM is the largest wholesale market or freetrade zone for electricity in the country and it amounts to no more than percent of the nations electric industry The remaining percent of the industry are divided into hundreds of wholesale markets with unique rules for pricing and operation So nine years after EPACT the bombs have begun to go off first in California where disastrous state policies mixed with federal mistakes have created a spectacular explosion then in Washington and Idaho two states that have not passed retail restructuring laws where retail rates are going up as much as percent and percent respectively And its only a matter of time before these electricity time bombs explode in other states The reality is that both the federal governments actions and inaction have made problems worse in California and elsewhere Denying that fact thwarts any efforts to fix the problem as does attacking environmental protection or endlessly repeating free market and states rights ideology Hopefully its not heresy but it must be said Strong federal action and wise intervention are required if wholesale markets are to be stabilized and made competitive First the federal government must organize the country into or regional wholesale electric markets each administered by an Independent System Operator that has the legal duty and necessary authority to ensure that each market is reliable and genuinely competitive Each ISO must have clear responsibility to identify and prevent market power abuses in order to protect public confidence in electricity markets and prevent more autopsies like that now being done on Californias effort to deregulate Second and absolutely crucial for the formation of competitive electricity markets the federal government should require that every state equip its retail customers with timeofuse metering and appliance control devices thermostat resetting and others which increase the price elasticity of demand Third electric markets cannot be competitive if either the wholesale or retail market remain closed All customers should be allowed to choose electricity suppliers by a certain specific date Fourth fuel diversity and clean energy have a clear value in these markets federal restructuring legislation should promote fuel diversity as well as address a host of major environmental problems by establishing reasonable renewable energy requirements Fifth the federal government must face up to the fact that in periods of peak demand or system emergency conditions suppliers currently have almost total pricing power and that high wholesale price caps are an immediate necessity At such times the price curve looks like a J with prices unlimited by demand changes climbing straight up The three wholesale markets that are administered by viable independent system operators PJM New York and New England all operate with a per megawatthour price cap They use caps not because they arent committed to making competition work but because demand is not currently responsive to price and because these emerging markets are vulnerable to strategic bidding that could destroy public support for more competition The sternest test of leadership for a modern politician is to face down his friends and the greatest act of friendship is to save a friend from himself The President could lessen the need for caps by telling some of his friends in the energy industry that they are behaving like a Marxist caricature of businessmen who only need to be given enough rope in order to hang themselves Some wholesale energy suppliers by persisting in wholesale markets that cannot limit prices by competition or demand response to charge or more per megawatthour prices that greatly exceed any cost or profit requirement have triggered a public reaction that could eventually crush them For example in California the recently passed emergency state statute suspends retail direct access and many communities are understandably beginning the process of forming municipal utilities The President must remind wholesale energy suppliers of the need for restraint while Americas dysfunctional wholesale electricity markets are repaired Americans deserve true functional clean and affordable competitive electric markets Because energy bills often consume at least percent of an average familys income and up to percent of a poor households takehome pay most Americans have little tolerance for high energy costs And as Jimmy Carter discovered the families that carry lunch buckets hold the people in government responsible for energy shortages and price spikes President Bush himself seems to sense that energy threatens his Presidency electricity alone could be its downfall Perhaps his talent for political survival will yet cause the President to change course on electric policy and break out of the confined ideological box which he appears on the verge of entering The fate of his presidency and our energy future may hang in the balance Ecubed is available for reprint in newspapers and other

loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June a month with high power prices In addition compared with June levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the West to percent over September levels Continued strong use of gasfired generation in the West as well as low US storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices Topock prices are expected to average per million British thermal units MMBtu in September These high September gas and power prices are driven by Declining hydroelectric output The months of September through November represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West with rainfall historically boosting output in December Approximately average megawatts aMW will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period This represents a net reduction in capacity of aMW when compared with the recent JuneAugust summer months and a reduction of aMW when compared with September levels Higher more variable power demand The Southwest and Southern California still experience hot weather in September and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in September Spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather Thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during September High levels of gasfired generation Load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in June a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour MWh range depending on the region This strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward An additional billion cubic feet Bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the US West compared with September levels Strong North American gas prices Natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as North American supplies remain tight A market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall As a result average September Henry Hub prices are expected to trade around per MMBtu An active storm season could keep Henry Hub prices near the mark Strong western basis differentials The strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the California markets CERA expects a TopocktoHenry Hub differential of per MMBtu during September Extended operational problems associated with El Pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlook Regional Power Market Drivers Hotterthannormal August weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during August Southern California average power prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of per MWh during the onpeak period and by per MWh during the offpeak period MidColumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from July price levels of per MWh for the onpeak period and per MWh in the offpeak period Offpeak prices which have averaged above per MWh during the JuneAugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources Onpeak prices during this same period at over per MWh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see Table A return to normal weather should drive Westwide loads down by aMW in September from August levels However load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by aMW when compared with September levels These greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of aMW from last Septembers levels will create supply tightness during September see Tables and Hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve Westwide demand in September even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load Gas demand for power generation is expected to average Bcf per day in September down from over Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic Bcf per day compared with levels in September September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per MWh with prices frequently higher as demand increases As this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight Hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship Cooler or hotterthannormal weather in September coupled with the inherent high variability of September loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes Under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per MWh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago September prices see Figure The latest revision of the California Independent System Operators ISOs imbalance energy market cap down to per MWh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in September CERA expects the ISO price cap to limit prices outside of California as well Pacific Northwest Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in September by at least aMW compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of August the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to aMW over the same period see Table Thus the Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in Northern California These price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation MidColumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per MWh in September Offpeak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south The expected September level of per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding markets California The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path and those to the south As in years past hydrodepleted Northern California should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich Southwest is constrained from entering Northern California by Path import limitations This condition which is expected to persist from September through November allows Northern California to price at a premium The expected monthly average onpeak Northern California price of per MWh incorporates this dynamic Notably the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California in part to capture locational price differences more effectively Southern California like the Southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in September During these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer In addition California as a whole should see average loads in September that are aMW higher than those of September Occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices Southern California benefits from the abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California An per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with Southern California onpeak prices averaging per MWh Offpeak prices of and per MWh for Northern and Southern California respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support September offpeak loads Rockies and Southwest An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in the Rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the West A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North Rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a September monthly onpeak price average of per MWh and an offpeak price average of per MWh CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern California on a monthly average basis The two regions generally experience the same September weather patterns and a strong MW transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other Strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per MWh level in September Offpeak prices will like those in Southern California be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation A price level of per MWh is expected for offpeak prices Regional Gas Market Drivers The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in North America with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile The storage deficit now stands at approximately Bcf and US storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels This critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September CERA expects a Henry Hub price of per MMBtu during September In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through September especially in California Overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the West from Bcf per day during August to Bcf per day during September see Table This load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month The recent price disconnects between the supplyrich Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basin and demandcharged California will persist October should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase In general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the West The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads Declines in flows into the San Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the San Juan On the other hand healthy California storage inventories should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season The startup of the new Alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the Midwest will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California California Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America although differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per MMBtu before this weekends pipeline explosion Total imports into California reached record levels during July total imports of Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet MMcf per day see Table Pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization So far in August pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in Southern California and the pressure should continue during September Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support Total demand in the state should average Bcf per day down only slightly from Augusts total of Bcf per day Flows into the state between August and September are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand The Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately per MMBtu for September see Table Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the United States but the storage surplus in the region has eroded In California inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during September The end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock differentials to winter price spikes Pacific Northwest Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan Basins have shown So far this month prices at Malin are averaging a per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub Pipeline capacity into the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full flows on PGT out of Alberta have averaged nearly Bcf per day this month Export capacity out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving the wide MalintoTopock differentials Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the West will likely hold through September In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb through September to Bcf per day from Bcf per day in August This demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current levels For September CERA expects Malin prices to average per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price Southwest Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising California demand Although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects between San Juan prices and Topock prices Pipeline capacity utilization rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached percent during July with less than MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply and in general the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices at Topock or the Permian Basin Unlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices The differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged per MMBtu so far this month and per MMBtu since June Additional imports from the Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by MMcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand the San Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September The San JuantoHenry Hub differential is expected to average per MMBtu As in the Rockies differentials should narrow substantially in October Rocky Mountains Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal CERA expects the heavy discountcurrent Rocky MountaintoHenry Hub differentials are around per MMBtuto persist through September Local area demand is not expected to change during September Substantial gain in local demand comes in October with heating loads October demand should average Bcf per day up from August and September averages of around Bcf per day Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the Rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per MMBtu range Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader North American markets this summer Next summer pressures on Rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer Although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedTrailblazer and Williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to increase by MMcf per day next year Western Canada After widening to over US per MMBtu the AECOHenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per MMBtu in July With current supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes having to pay full cost to flow differentials are likely to persist in the midUSs per MMBtu for September AECO is expected to be US per MMBtu C per gigajoule for September Even with the startup of the Alliance project the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted pipeline costs This will result in differentials that will range between US and US per MMBtu throughout the winter Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last years levels The pace of drilling over gas wells are expected this year should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into Supply is expected to be flat with on an annual basis for this year and up at least MMcf per day in Sumas prices have been quite volatile driven by both weather in the Pacific Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system For September Sumas is expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO of US per MMBtu end Follow URL for PDF version of

Richard ES cc Subject fyi Forwarded by Cindy DerecskeyCorpEnron on PM Martin Kim on PM To cc Subject fyi Didnt know if you saw this column in todays LA Times but he makes some good arguments JAMES FLANIGAN Simple Steps May Ease SelfInflicted Electricity Woes Los Angeles Times August Return to Headlines Publication Date Friday August Page C Los Angeles Times Home Edition Copyright The Times Mirror Company By JAMES FLANIGAN Lets be clear the fact that the state botched the job of deregulation to begin with is one reason Californias electricity market is such a mess But failure to build a single new power plant in the state even as Californias economy expanded its use of electricity is the basic cause of todays shortages and soaring prices in San Diego Orange County and other areas Still some simple steps can be taken by regulators legislators and Gov Gray Davis to provide immediate relief The states major utilities should be free to buy power wherever they can get it They should not have to buy exclusively from the Power Exchange the Pasadenabased power pool that was set up by the deregulation to achieve auctionbased prices for roughly of the states electricity Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating plants that supply power at times of peak demand That could alleviate a tight supplydemand situation over the next year or two while larger plants are built Long term the state needs to speed up the approval process for building new electricity plants The state also should force utilities to invest in the stillregulated system of power transmission lines which now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas Perhaps the most glaring fact about Californias electricity problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this enormous market the nations biggest Only or so suppliers including federal agencies the states own utilities municipal companies and private generating firms supply power to Californias system By contrast Pennsylvania which has an electricity market less than the size of Californias has separate suppliers of electricity today reports John Quain chairman of that states Public Utility Commission Its no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly electric bills drop on average since deregulation Its worked out terrifically Quain says What did California do wrong It allowed the states major utilitiesPacific Gas Electric Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electricto recover of their unrecovered or stranded costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative sources of energy Then Californias legislators told the utilities to sell their conventional power plants to private generating companies all of which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange The California scheme was flawed at once overregulated and yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power pool fed by only a handful of suppliers How did Pennsylvania do it It allowed the states utilities to recover no more than of their stranded costs for nuclear plantsreasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk of their investments And rather than set up a central power exchange the state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the states electric system to compete for business Competition after all is what deregulation is supposed to encourage And competition is not happening in California It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West All the Western states are suffering electricity problems Thats another reason for Californias trouble Normally of Californias electricity comes from US and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and Washington Nevada and Arizona But this year because of lower hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those other states power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive when the state can get it Now there are accusations that some suppliers to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract premium prices for power Theres nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in using futures markets and other trading techniques as some generators may have done If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion federal and other investigations will determine the facts But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit us The California regulators legislators and utilities did Told to sell their generating plants in the utilities sold dozens of plants in package deals of two and three to single buyers They received premium prices from buyers such as AES Corp Duke Energy Southern Co Reliant Energy Dynegy and NRG The premiums were paid for the market leverage that multiple plants afforded the buyers Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing market leverage to potential commercial adversaries Nobody in the Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power Exchange could be held up by market leverage As outsiders often say about Californians Maybe its the sunshine makes them slow END EDT August Copyright Times Mirror Company

James D SteffesNAEnron on PM Mona L ES PM To Gary ES cc Douglas ES Martin ES West GA Harry ES James D nron Joe nron Subject Re SDGE represenatation of future market conditions Gary Thanks for passing this information along This is a pretty welldocumented discussion which is always helpful when we contact the utility about such conduct Obviously this is very concerning about SDGE countermarketing while promoting choice In addition some of their assumptions seem to require tremendous leaps of faith I havent seen an application to aggregate yet but I would assume there would be heavy protests to such a proposal SDGE solicited my feedback on such a position and I told them we werent interested Im not sure what type of ruling they are expecting from FERC lower price caps or a return to costbased rates pretty extreme Decision per Sue Mara is not expected until December SDGE does have bilateral contracting authority and at least thus far has not exercised it Customers have already experienced what leaving it to SDGE will get them Once bitten twice shy Enron Energy Services From Gary Mirich PM Phone No To Mona L ES cc Douglas ES Martin WenzelSFOHOUEES Subject SDGE represenatation of future market conditions Mona I thought you should have the following information due to your ongoing work with SDGE to facilitate open market choice by their regulated customers As you know Ive been working with SAIC to close business for the last days We had offered them a month price on of their load for approximately centskWh They compared our offers to others that were significantly higher As part of their decisionmaking process and in an attempt to confirm that SDGE wasnt preparing to release any kind of drastic rate reductionrelief in the immediate future SAICs treasurer called SDGEs CEO for a meeting with an SDGE exec On SAICs treasurer Dan Baldwin met with SDGEs SVP of Fuels and Power Ops Gary Cotton Another SAIC exec Rene Terrazas VP Real Estate was also in that meeting He is my source for the following comments from SDGE SDGE expects to be given authority very soon to aggregate customers much like direct access providers in order to provide betterthanmarket pricing SDGE expects FERC to come out with something that will reduce the prices that retail standard offer customers are paying No detail from SDGE on what form FERCs action would take or when SDGEs recent bilateral contracting authority should result in lower prices for SAIC SDGE suggested that very few customers have switched to DA because their is too much uncertainty about the future He said that SAIC is part of of SDGEs customers that have not switched to date This SDGE exec said he thought that prices would soon return to a more reasonable level and that SAIC should be expecting direct access prices around centskWh Even though SAIC currently suffers from analysisparalysis SDGEs comments about the state of the market are very concerning First pawning off SAIC to an exec in fuels and ops for advise about the retail open market hardly seems appropriate Second SDGEs suggestion to SAIC that they are somehow in good company by waiting is directly in contrast to what SDGEs regulatory affairs people are attempting to promote with the supplier selection initiative Third for SDGE to even hint that there are regulatory FERC CPUC or otherwise fixes soon to be announced that will relieve SAICs pricing dilema is at the very least irresponsible In Renes opinion the SDGE exec was using the same old fear uncertainty and doubt lines that utility execs typically employed prior to direct access in their efforts to retain customers Finally and most concerning to me is that SDGE has an executive willing to make a guess about the price SAIC should be expecting to receive in this market Many market sources eg Bloomberg besides Enron wouldnt predict a price as low as cents Nevermind that Mr Cotton is likely unqualified to make such a claim but even if he was I think he is way off base for even entertaining the question In light of our efforts to work with SDGE to facilitate customer transition to DA I think these comments indicate that their executive team is not truly on board with the work of SDGEs regulatory affairs EES is in a stand down right now with SAIC who decided after their meeting with SDGE that Enrons offer may not be as competitive as previously believed Their treasurer has decided to wait and see perhaps a month or more Irrespective of my ability to close this deal today or in the future I wanted you to be aware of the SDGEs comments and how theyve impacted one SDGE customers decision to leave the utility Perhaps we should suggest that customer inquiries like those of SAIC go through regulatory affairs instead of execs who have twisted andor minimal information and a willingness to guess about the future Your comments welcome thanks much Gary

<16697522.1075854428567.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,james.steffes@enron.com,2000-12-12 14:22:00,East Power RTO Strategy Cc first round of RTO filings and responses complete it is a good time to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in and lay out our plan going into A Key Facts FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS It does not appear that FERC in its current form will modify its standing policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let flowers bloom While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a different position we have seen no signals that anything will change Faced with this policy as the initial RTO filings made clear almost all utilities are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic transmission assets Accordingly most of the proposed RTOs do not remove the fundamental problem the Native Load exception THE MIDWEST CANT MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO The three big utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd IP and Ameren probably of total load in initial MISO Key problems for the MISO include a MISOs notforprofit status key IP claim b parties interest in taking energy east key ComEd need and c fair retention of rd party wheeling revenues Ameren want Meetings with regional stakeholders public power industrials State PUCs have been productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred option however we await action from the FERC MISO is also telling everyone that can listen that if the big three pull out it probably wont continue While the MISO process is very open to the public not so with the Alliance RTO neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED NOTHING Rather than take a major step forward Southern and Grid South SCANA CPL Duke have initially filed noncompliant RTOs Grid South does nothing to advance a market much less provide transmission service in a nondiscriminatory fashion In fact Grid South simply takes the current OATT and combines the three utilities for wheeling through purposes PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERCS SHINING LIGHT PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was necessary rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the right example PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order in that filing PJM is also expanding So far Allegheny Power and DQE have agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called PJM West In terms of market coordination PJM has been publicly reluctant to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools PJM NYISO NEISO and Ontario IMO The other pools are not getting very much accomplished in their efforts For example NEISO has indicated that it wont have the DayAhead market ready until at the earliest ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail access pilot program beginning next summer The rules are still being structured We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines dont overwhelm good market structure Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading our efforts and are very active SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG In a surprise move the actions so far in Grid Florida while certainly not perfect appear to be moving in the right direction The FL PSC has gone from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during this Legislative session Enron will be involved B Steps FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION FERC will have new leadership some time in early if we can get a President Enron is developing a coordinated political plan Capitol Hill media Administration industry allies to impress upon the next Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue to drive wholesale market reforms Without a stronger mandate it may prove difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of More importantly it will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight In those RTOs that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception no amount of meetings or filings will change the parties COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to ensure that Enrons objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to coordinate daytoday activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no opportunity is missed This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs of the commercial teams We continue to have at least one person dedicated to each RTO market NYISO Howard Fromer NEISO Dan Allegretti IMO Aleck Dadson PJM Tom Hoatson MISOAlliance Jeff Brown Dave Mangskau Grid South Tom Chapman Joe Connor Southern Joe Connor Florida Dan Staines SPP Ron McNamara ERCOT Robin Kittel Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June July to also work on wholesale market issues PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS NEISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration matters not much progress has been made to date Moving power between the pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling rules FERC is aware of these problems Again FERC has not done anything to mandate compliance with Order We have deployed an additional resource in Houston recently to help support Enrons involvement in the tight pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all developments as close to realtime as possible CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO We continue to advocate our agenda to anyone that will listen This work is time consuming much spent listening to junk from monopolist Transmission Owners and detailed Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our resources FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT etrans Project etrans has resulted in a new business consortium etransconsortiumcom This combination of APX Cal PX and Alstom ESCA has developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the market frontend for any RTO eg dayahead market transmission exchange etc Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates our policy objectives We are now turning our attention to finding the right Grid Operator We are in discussions with National Grid American Transmission Company MISO and PJM although they may want to do something very similar The goal remains the same to have a fully functioning entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action I will be taking a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in DONT FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION DIVESTITURE Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets through direct access and divestiture It will take nondiscriminatory transmission access retail choice and generation divestiture to enable a fully thriving wholesale market Of course additional market openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California I hope this helps put some framework around our activities If anyone wants to discuss this in more detail Id be happy to meet individually or as a group Jim
