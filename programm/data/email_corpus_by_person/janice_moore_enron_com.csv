ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this

has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have

CT Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Michael A CT Deborah nron Brenda NRON Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Im on the same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM Janice R CT AM To Britt

ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Thanks for the headsup on this issue I will confer with Janice and one of us will get back to you Meanwhile I think I may need further clarification about what testing methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines My key area of concern is whether as now appears unlikely from your email SGS tested using both ASTM D without ashing and ASTM D with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in Thailand and the Phillipines May I impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods ASTM D without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt You have just sent something like this for the Thailand cargo only which I found very helpful Also if SGS or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo please let me know about that as well I appreciate your good help Britt Matthias CT AM To Janice R CT Britt NRON cc Alan CT Harry M CT Angeline CT Subject D Dear Janice Britt I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and coordinate with Mike Browns team and myself in regard to the D issue whilst I am to look to Britts guidance for the contamination on the Elang cargo My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end next week The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor As you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals We would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D If it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight D the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First Gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt Although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recover It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results We still have SGSs support for that but we need to convince Minton Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the OwnersPI Club Still just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to Firts Gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method acceptable to parties whether D or ashing or some other method That said I think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas I note Janices preference for US experts over European experts for the D issue Have we been able to get any US experts view on the right test to use whether D or ashing Has Enron formed a view on the correct test method If we have been able to source a friendly US expert we may want to have

CT Alan CT Harry M CT Richard B CT Michael A CT Deborah nron Brenda NRON Subject Re DIn re MV PACIFIC VIRGO PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEYCLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT Matt Im on the same page as Janice with regard to testing although Id like to spin out my thoughts a bit In my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both D with ashing and D without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis Mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons Prior to the joint analysis Mitsubishi will be aware that a D without ashing is in the FGH contract and that b ECT believes D without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product Given this if ECT proposes to use only D with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D without ashing The same would apply I think if even if ECT proposed to use only D without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis The more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec Mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT to credibly take the position that only one test or the other D with ashing or D without ashing should be run in fact in light of what I believe is virtually inevitable Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to Mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi and not the other way around Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in Singapore I know that we nominated SGS Singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using SGSs lab As Janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with D with and without ashing Also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of the presale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo This latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with SGS about any of this I would suggest that you first confer with David or Neal Many thanks for your help Britt Again many thanks for your help Britt Forwarded by Britt DavisCorpEnron on PM Janice R CT AM To Britt
