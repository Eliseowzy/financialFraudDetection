appreciated Sincerely Donald L Evans Board of Directors wwwbushcheneytransitioncom BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Paid for by BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law legally cast votes The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election Count first and rule upon legality afterwards is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires Another issue in this case moreover is the propriety indeed the constitutionality of letting the standard for determination of voters intent dimpled chad hanging chads etc vary from county to county as the Florida Supreme court opinion as interpreted by the Circuit Court permits If petitioner Bush is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later since it is generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the ballots which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate Click here to review the Order of the US Supreme Court in Bush v Gore Saturday GoNowaaaa Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T Wells DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J WELLS Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution Excerpt I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the majority However I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process I also believe that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution My succinct conclusion is that the majoritys decisionhas no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion The majority returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of undervotes on the basis of unknown or at best ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others the credentials qualifications and objectivity of whom are totally unknown That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority creates This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over continued judicial process I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos a professor of mathematics at Temple University when he wrote that the margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory no matter who wins Further judicial process will not change this selfevident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder Justice Terrell and this

scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return the case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from MiamiDade County

country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis Judge Wells said the countyby county decisionmaking on the clear indication of the intent of the voter is fraught with equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts or Congress For example in MiamiDade County the justices reinstated votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts conducted in only some precincts all of them overwhelmingly Democratic This would be the ultimate in treating some votes differently from others The Court ordered a recount of all counties undervotes but there are five major problems First in many counties the undervotes arent even segregated so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated We know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other degradation of ballots Second counties dont even know which of their nonvotes are undervotes and which are overvotes Third even in counties that have attempted to separate the undervote there are serious problems In MiamiDade the number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is different from the number identified in the November machine recount There can be no confidence that the pool of undervotes is untainted and consistent Fourth the majority accepted two different standards the liberal Broward

decision of the Florida Supreme Court just announced which will require manually recounting tens of thousands of nonvotes and undervotes in all Florida counties that have not yet had a manual recount and trying to do so by December This is what happens when for the first time in modern history a candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of an election for President It is very sad For Florida for the nation and for our democracy Todays ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of course a disappointment Its reasoning and result place the Court once again at odds with sound judgments of Floridas lower courts the Florida Legislature local election officials and in our view the US Supreme Court This action will unfortunately produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise Floridas votes in the Electoral College The ruling of the Florida Courts four justices is flawed in much the same way we think as its November ruling that was vacated unanimously by the United States Supreme Court Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his dissent today Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return this case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from either MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at any time until the issuance of this opinion The prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis I have to conclude that there is a real and present likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial damage to our country our state and to this Court as an institution pp We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of the other four We believe this ruling is inconsistent with Florida law federal law and the United States Constitution Therefore we have no alternative other than to appeal once again to the United States Supreme Court for relief We have already put in motion the process to do so WHAT THEYRE SAYING Judge Andrew Napolitano Fox News Legal Analyst what is this doing Changing the rules yet again in the face of a federal law that says you cant change counting procedures and rules after six days prior to the election Fox News Channel Jim Axelrod CBS News Correspondent One of the first people I saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass a member of the Gore legal team I asked him what was next He said Chaos So far nothings been done to help clarify the situation CBS Evening News Tim Russert NBC News we could have chaos and a constitutional crisisThis is as close to a political civil war as Ive ever witnessed NBC Nightly News Mike Isikoff Newsweek Magazine The Republicans got a bit of a shot in the arm I was just reading the dissent of Chief Justice Wells on this case and he is pretty stinging It is surprising language from a chief justice of a state court He pretty much says flatly that his colleagues were wrong as a matter of law Theyre going to be reversed byhe predicts they will be reversed by the US Supreme Court and also projectstalks about a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this So if the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on theyve got it in this dissent John Gibson Mike Isikoff a crucial question is here What standard is this recount going to be counted under Any clue Mike Isikoff No

certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return this case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from either MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at any time until the issuance of this opinion The prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis I have to conclude that there is a real and present likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial damage to our country our state and to this Court as an institution pp We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of the other four We believe this ruling is inconsistent with Florida law federal law and the United States Constitution Therefore we have no alternative other than to appeal once again to the United States Supreme Court for relief We have already put in motion the process to do so WHAT THEYRE SAYING Judge Andrew Napolitano Fox News Legal Analyst what is this doing Changing the rules yet again in the face of a federal law that says you cant change counting procedures and rules after six days prior to the election Fox News Channel Jim Axelrod CBS News Correspondent One of the first people I saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass a member

Theyre going to be reversed byhe predicts they will be reversed by the US Supreme Court and also projectstalks about a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this So if the Republicans need

the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that states electoral votes It is now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration In

appreciated Sincerely Donald L Evans Board of Directors wwwbushcheneytransitioncom BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Paid for by BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law legally cast votes The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election Count first and rule upon legality afterwards is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires Another issue in this case moreover is the propriety indeed the constitutionality of letting the standard for determination of voters intent dimpled chad hanging chads etc vary from county to county as the Florida Supreme court opinion as interpreted by the Circuit Court permits If petitioner Bush is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later since it is generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the ballots which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate Click here to review the Order of the US Supreme Court in Bush v Gore Saturday GoNowaaaa Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles

with their decision to reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process I also believe that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under

credentials qualifications and objectivity of whom are totally unknown That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority creates This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over continued judicial process I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos a professor of mathematics at Temple University when he wrote that the margin of error in this election

in and even while they won statewide Despite the tough odds Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of President Bush While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative campaigning Forbes won the district by more than votes The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush Democrats were desperate to win but Republicans won another victory in a swing district To give you a bit of historical perspective there have been special elections over the past years Only of those special elections resulted in a change of party representation for the seat and only three of those swung toward the party of the President Historical odds were not in his favor but Representativeelect Forbes defied the odds So what does this historydefying Republican victory mean to us on a national level The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide momentum across the political spectrum for President Bushs agenda for America And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum You helped President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldnt be done

James Baker What Theyre Saying Well if youre a fan of chaos youre in Nirvana John Shubin Florida Elections Expert MSNBC SUMMARY OF FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECISION A deeply divided Florida Supreme Court has opened up a Pandoras box of inconsistent standards flawed hand counting and delays that call into question Floridas ability to be represented in the Electoral College Further the courts narrow liberal majority has made a mockery of the idea of counting every vote by selecting only certain ballots and providing no standard to count them The four activist justices rewrote Floridas election laws after the election a clear violation of federal law Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and forceful dissent concluding The majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return the case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis Judge Wells said the countyby county decisionmaking on the clear indication of the intent of the voter is fraught with equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts or Congress For example in MiamiDade County the justices reinstated votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts conducted in only some precincts all of them overwhelmingly Democratic This would be the ultimate in treating some votes differently from others The Court ordered a recount of all counties undervotes but there are five major problems First in many counties the undervotes arent even segregated so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated We know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other degradation of ballots Second counties dont even know which of their nonvotes are undervotes and which are overvotes Third even in counties that have attempted to separate the undervote there are serious problems In MiamiDade the number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is different from the number identified in the November machine recount There can be no confidence that the pool of undervotes is untainted and consistent Fourth the majority accepted two different standards the liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach standard further proving votes are treated differently in each county Fifth as Chief Justice Wells said the liberal court majority failed to make provision for the qualifications of those who count what standards are used in the countare they the same standards for all ballots statewide or a continuation of the countyby county constitutionally suspect standards who is to observe the count how one objects to the count who is entitled to object to the count whether a person may object to a counter the possible lack of personnel to conduct the count

FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A BAKER III December Ladies and Gentlemen This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee Two Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots in Seminole and Martin counties A federal judge ordering the counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were not counted for technical reasons And of course the disappointing to decision of the Florida Supreme Court just announced which will require manually recounting tens of thousands of nonvotes and undervotes in all Florida counties that have not yet had a manual recount and trying to do so by December This is what happens when for the first time in modern history a candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of an election for President It is very sad For Florida for the nation and for our democracy Todays ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of course a disappointment Its reasoning and result place the Court once again at odds with sound judgments of Floridas lower courts the Florida Legislature local election officials and in our view the US Supreme Court This action will unfortunately produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise Floridas votes in the Electoral College The ruling of the Florida Courts four justices is flawed in much the same way we think as its November ruling that was vacated

world on Friday September during the National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of the Terrorist Attacks The National Cathedral Washington DC PM EDT September THE PRESIDENT We are here in the middle hour of our grief So many have suffered so great a loss and today we express our nations sorrow We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead and for those who love them On Tuesday our country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel Now come the names the list of casualties we are only beginning to read They are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport busy with life They are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called home to say be brave and I love you They are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of others on the ground They are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United States and died at their posts They are the names of rescuers the ones whom death found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others We will read all these names We will linger over them and learn their stories and many Americans will weep To the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation And I assure you you are not alone Just three days removed from these events Americans do not yet have the distance of history But our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder This nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing Our purpose as a nation is firm Yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray In many of our prayers this week there is a searching and an honesty At St Patricks Cathedral in New York on Tuesday a woman said I prayed to God to give us a sign that He is still here Others have prayed for the same searching hospital to hospital carrying pictures of those still missing Gods signs are not always the ones we look for We learn in tragedy that his purposes are not always our own Yet the prayers of private suffering whether in our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood There are prayers that help us last through the day or endure the night There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us strength for the journey And there are prayers that yield our will to a will greater than our own This world He created is of moral design Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time Goodness remembrance and love have no end And the Lord of life holds all who die and all who mourn It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves This is true of a nation as well In this trial we have been reminded and the world has seen that our fellow Americans are generous and kind resourceful and brave We see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion in long lines of blood donors in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible And we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice Inside the World Trade Center one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end at the side of his quadriplegic friend A beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter Two office workers finding a disabled stranger carried her down sixtyeight floors to safety A group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin grafts for burn victims In these acts and in many others Americans showed a deep commitment to one another and an abiding love for our country Today we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called the warm courage of national unity This is a unity of every faith and every background It has joined together political parties in both houses of Congress It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and American flags which are displayed in pride and wave in defiance Our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies And this unity against terror is now extending across the world America is a nation full of good fortune with so much to be grateful for But we are not spared from suffering In every generation the world has produced enemies of human freedom They have attacked America because we are freedoms home and defender And the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our time On this national day of prayer and remembrance we ask almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow We thank Him for each life we now must mourn and the promise of a life to come As we have been assured neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from Gods love May He bless the souls of the departed May He comfort our own And may He always guide our country God bless America From Miami Heralds Leonard Pitts Jrs column on September entitled Well Go Forward From this Moment Its my job to have something to say They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the American soul But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes the only thing I can find to say the only words that seem to fit must be addressed

Court Justice Scalia Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T Wells Greetings Friends The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court and Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that states electoral votes It is now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration In order to begin that task we have filed articles of incorporation for the BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation a nonprofit corporation As past transition foundations have done we are applying for c status from the Internal Revenue Service Now we are asking for your help as our team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short period between now and inauguration

appreciated Sincerely Donald L Evans Board of Directors wwwbushcheneytransitioncom BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Paid for by BushCheney Presidential Transition Foundation Inc Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law legally cast votes The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election Count first and rule upon legality afterwards is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires Another issue in this case moreover is the propriety indeed the constitutionality of letting the standard for determination of voters intent dimpled chad hanging chads etc vary from county to county as the Florida Supreme court opinion as interpreted by the Circuit Court permits If petitioner Bush is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later since it is generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the ballots which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate Click here to review the Order of the US Supreme Court in Bush v Gore Saturday GoNowaaaa Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T Wells DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J WELLS Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution Excerpt I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the majority However I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process I also believe that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution My succinct conclusion is that the majoritys decisionhas no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion The majority returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of undervotes on the basis of unknown or at best ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others the credentials qualifications and objectivity of whom are totally unknown That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority creates This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over continued judicial process I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos a professor of mathematics at Temple University when he wrote that the margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory no matter who wins Further judicial process will not change this selfevident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder Justice Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action sixtyfour years ago I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls Click here to review the Florida Supreme Court Opinion in Gore v Harris

the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft Presidentelect Bushs choice for Attorney General The hallmark of Senator Ashcrofts long history of public service has been integrity As Attorney General he will uphold the law and make the Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of He brings a unique record of service to this challenge He was twice elected Missouris Attorney General serving with both Republican and Democrat Governors He was elected Governor of Missouri an important swing state and then reelected with of the vote John then was elected to the US Senate where he just finished a sixyear term No other Attorney General has ever had this wealth of experience John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues including Won

minorities Appointed many AfricanAmericans to Missouris courts Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King holiday Created an award honoring George Washington Carvers Accomplishments saved Lincoln College an historic Black college founded by AfricanAmerican veterans of the Civil War Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge Every Republican Senator opposed Whites confirmation in part because he urged a lower legal standard for a man convicted of firstdegree murder times including the first degree murder of three police officers Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he disagrees This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new Administration Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to carry out the letter of the law He will restore the rule of law to the Justice Department and run a highly professional department Please do two things First let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation process for John Ashcroft Go to senatorssenatorbystatecfm to find the contact information for the

friends and associates It is time for truth to prevail and for Gore to concede Thank you Jim Nicholson Chairman RNC SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTH There are more than votes in MiamiDade that have never been counted David Boies There are over ballots that have never been counted once for the presidency of the United States Today Show FACT Every ballot in MiamiDade was counted at least twice once on election night and again during the automatic recount In every election there are a significant number of ballots that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot including races for President For example in this election of the voters in Idaho of the voters in Illinois and of the voters in Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President The votes actually according to their filing about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only of the ballots cast in MiamiDade These ballots were counted twice they merely registered no vote for President This reality reflects common sense a voter may want to vote for a candidate for the Senate House or other office but be undecided about the choice for President In particular a voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates but be uncomfortable with his or her partys choice for President and yet unwilling to vote for the other partys candidate So he or she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for President MYTH If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the recount Gore would actually be ahead by votes FACT Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount from MiamiDade and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of the certified votes from Nassau County The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of pm on Sunday for completing manual recounts almost tripling the statutory time period for counting mandated by Floridas Legislature Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Courts deadline MiamiDade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with a manual recount The interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade came from a selective recount of the most Democrat precincts Gore won these selected precincts by approximately to while Gore won the entire county only by to It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican precincts too Precincts in MiamiDade including those with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters favored Bush The Gore approach would treat these minorities in a discriminatory fashion Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law should be counted Counties recognized this and counted them Even Joe Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected Even if you add the interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade and the final manual recount of net for Gore in Palm Beach as reported by the NYT and then also subtract the over votes that belong to Bush in Nassau County see below Bush still wins by well over votes MYTH MiamiDade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican mob that intimidated the canvassing board KLAIN We think already almost votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the count But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility stop a count and then thats going to provide the end because a partisan of the Bush campaign Ms Harris refuses to accept returns and cuts off the counting I dont think thats the kind of end that we have to American elections GMA FACT The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Boards decision to move the recount behind closed doors where it could not be observed by the public or the media and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd The police made no arrests received no assault complaints and did not even instruct the crowd to desist The crowd was quieted promptly MYTH In Nassau County the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal FACT On election night all the votes were counted but during the machine recount ballots were accidentally separated from the rest and not counted As a result Bush received fewer votes and Gore received fewer votes than on election night After the recount the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake and tried to correct it Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at pm the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate The Board Democrats and Republican voted unanimously to certify the original election night count which included the ballots rather than the machine recount total which mistakenly omitted those ballots QUOTES Mr Gore the Wheel has Turned and its Time for this to End I think the vice president should take the high ground and hand it over Rep Julia Carson DIN Associated Press interview conducted over the phone Mr Gore End It Now Editorial headline in the Chicago Tribune Enough is enough For nations welfare Gore should accept loss Editorial headline in the San Diego UnionTribune I have grave doubts about whether it is wise for the country for the purposes of just healing all of the wounds for the vice president to continue to pursue and to contest the results in Florida Former ClintonGore Labor Secretary Robert Reich His determination to keep fighting even after Sunday nights formal declaration that George W Bush won the presidential race in Florida presents the increasingly unappealing portrait of a man who wants to be a winner at any cost Chicago Tribune Editorial The only thing to be gained by contesting the Florida balloting as Sen Joseph Lieberman vowed last night to do is to put the nation through a divisive ordeal that could provoke a constitutional crisis unprecedented in modern times San Diego UnionTribune Editorial Palm Beach Canvassing Judge Charles Burton going into this we felt that whatever standard we came up withit had to be fair it had to be geared towards achieving a fair result not geared towards achieving a certain result the Democratic Party the Republican Party everybody agreed to the standard we had applied in reviewing these ballots It was only after about four days into it that the Democratic Party went back to court to try and you know basically have us change that standard because I guess they realized they werent getting enough votes ABCs Good Morning America Help the RNC fight for fair elections Follow this link to make a secure online contribution

the job done and we got it done right People called me and sayparticularly from out of stateand say whats going on down in Florida and I have to keep reminding people the only thing thats going on here is that weve got a razorthin election for the most important job in the world And thats all it is After all the jokes after all of the anguish weve just got a close election And any state that had to go through this wouldve had the same problems I think that we have had But I think its over It should be over And maybe thats the important word there should You know Yogi Berra once said Its not over till its over Well its over and we have a winner and its time to move on Theres one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough legal talent to keep this tied up through Christmas But one thing the lawyers cant do for us and one thing the courts cant do for us They cant bring this country together again And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight its going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together again and I hope we can get on with that work soon And Im proud of the job that weve done here in the state Reaction to Governor Bushs Statement RE What Gore needs to consider The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like and that Gore requested Bush still won counting with Gores rules Gore has to consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at this and say Guys you had your shot the count the recount they changed the rules for you and you still did not win Its time to be magnanimous RE Governor Bushs Speech the tonewas perfect There was a persistence and a determination in what Governor Bush said but it was also incredibly conciliatory It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this and that probably goes to peoples hearts Bob Woodward on Larry King Live CNN Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court Says Expert Fox News Channel Fox News Brit Hume does the Gore team not have something to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on Friday Thatthat creates sort of a period of continuing a sort of unfinality if such a word exists National Journals Stuart Taylor Unless Im missing something that is completely hollow spin There is nothing what so ever I thinkthat the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore They could do some things for George W Bush but Al Gore hasnt asked them to do anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done But I dont think hes in the position to say Oh by the way could you order some more recounts So I think there is nothing ifGore runs out of ammunition Which I think he may well do before the Supreme Court of the United States gets to a hearing I think he has to give up because theres nothing Call To Action Florida tonight certified the votes cast in the Presidential Election giving its electoral votes to George W Bush George W Bush won the vote on election day and won the mandated recount He won on November after the inclusion of the overseas ballots Now he has won after the manual recount as directed by the Florida Supreme Court and the results have been certified If you believe this election should end and that endless lawsuits are not good for our country please call your Congressman and Senator regardless of their party affiliation and tell them that Al Gore should concede If you wish to unsubscribe from the eChampion mailing list simply click here partnerechampionsunsubscribeboxhtml To become an eChampion click here

Ruling On Dimpled Ballots What About Todays Action on Military Ballots The Greenwood Position Now We Must Fight for Our Country Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt Wall Street Journal How Democrats Wage Political War Exit Polling Says At Least Of Americans Did Not Vote In Presidential Contest Voting Instructions Were Clear in Palm Beach County The US Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the Florida presidential recount saying Friday it will hear one of George W Bushs appeals that seeks to bar handcounted ballots in the disputed election In a stunning development and a victory for Bush the nations highest court said it will hear arguments Dec on whether to overturn the Florida Supreme Courts decision that allowed manually recounted votes to be added to Floridas vote total Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For MiamiDade Recount We are pleased with the Supreme Court decision It was our strong belief that the Florida Supreme Court would deny this motion The court had already extended the statutory deadline for an additional days and Al Gore was asking them to extend it yet again Thursday night Al Gore thanked the canvassing boards for their hard work and praised the Supreme Court decision Since then he has sued one of those canvassing boards and asked the Supreme Court to change its mind It seems Al Gore wants the Court to keep extending the deadline until he can count the votes enough times to change the result Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots The Illinois Supreme Court Ruling was incorrectly cited by the Gore campaign and the Florida Supreme Court and does NOT require dimpled ballots to be counted In fact in the Illinois case dimpled ballots were not counted at all Illinois attorney Burton Odelson who represented the challenger in the Illinois case said the judge did not count ballots that were indented because he could not determine the voters intent Contrary to the arguments made by David Boies for the Gore campaign Cook County Circuit Judge Francis Barth said I dont believe the fact that an impression standing alone counts necessarily that this voter intended then to vote Of the disputed ballots the Illinois Supreme Court ordered Judge Barth to examine he rejected nine dimpled ballots because as he said the dents were insufficient to prove the voters intent He rejected four others with pinholes that were misaligned accepted three hanging chads in which the perforation was partially attached and approved five ballots punctured by pinholes Six disputed ballots were withdrawn Michael Levelle a Democrat lawyer representing the Republican candidate in Illinois initially signed an affidavit on behalf of the Gore campaign saying to the best of his recollection he believed Judge Barth counted indented ballots But when later told that Judge Barth did not include dimpled ballots Levelle recanted I couldnt remember details The affidavit was more general than specific What About Todays Action on Military Ballots To protect the rights of our military men and women to have their votes count the BushCheney campaign today is asking a Florida Circuit Court in Tallahassee to require canvassing boards to immediately go back and review overseas military ballots for inclusion in the final vote tally We urge Al Gore to support this action One week ago tonight in an orchestrated effort that included a fivepage memo by a Gore attorney Al Gores supporters objected to as many military ballots as they could find The Gore campaign never should have knocked out the votes of the men and women who wear our nations uniform Thats no way to treat the men and women who serve our country They never should have taken that action in the first place Today is the day to right this wrong A State Judge will conduct a hearing at today in Leon County to hear our case We hope the Judge will ask the Boards to review these military ballots so our servicemen and women arent disenfranchised Given the remarks made about counting military ballots by Senator Lieberman Floridas Democratic Senator Bob Graham and Floridas Democratic Attorney General and chairman of Gores Florida campaign Bob Butterworth we cant imagine the Gore campaign will once again oppose the voting rights of our servicemen and women The Greenwood Position Now we must fight for our country BY PEGGY NOONAN Friday November We must fight And we all know it And its fine We like to complain those of us of a certain age that history has never given us the gaudy challenges it gave our parents and grandparents But weve had our traumas and from the time we were children assassinations riots Vietnam Watergate the ayatollah a stuck economy the fall of the wall Weve had our moments And now we face a great trial And were up to it So lets go Full Story columnistspnoonanid Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt By Richard Cohen Friday November I voted for Al Gore I did so because I have known him since he was a congressman from Tennessee I admire his intellect his seriousness of purpose his capacity for hard work and study his political values his experience and his knowledge That being said I now think that under current circumstances he would not be the right man for the presidency If I could I would withdraw my vote In the terminology of the moment put me down as a hanging chad I still think precisely as I have about Gore But those current circumstances I just mentioned change everything Given the present bitterness given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator a likable guy who will make things better and not worse That man is not Al Gore That man is George W Bush Bush has incessantly proclaimed himself as that sort of guya uniter not a divider The tendency is to dismiss that sort of chestthumping as campaign nonsense but in Bushs case it appears to be true After all the Bush boomlet began among his fellow Republican governors each of whom probably thought the next president should be none other than himself So it says something about Bush that the governors were able to coalesce around him Some of these governors knew Bush quite well some hardly at all but the fact remains that they all seemed to genuinely like the guy and respected his leadership abilities You hear the same sort of thing from people who worked with Bush in private enterprise I talked with one of them once a Democrat who disagreed with Bush on many issues Yet he too praised Bushs leadership abilities his talent for bringing order out of chaos and for reaching some sort of consensus That mans testimony impressed me His disagreements with Bush were real his admiration for him profound Gore on the other hand has little of those abilities His own party is sore at him for taking the onetwo punch of peace and prosperity and running a race that is still not concluded His performance was as erratic as his uniformoftheday earth tones on Tuesday business suit on Wednesday The country sensed that either he did not know himself or what he did know the country would not like Full Story wpdynarticlesANovhtml

the Gore campaignturnedlawfirm let there be no doubt that the goings on in Florida are perfectly in keeping with the way Democrats normally think and behave Lawsuits are a key part of the Democrats political strategy so nothing about Florida should surprise anyone who has spent time in the Democratic Party Until I was a Democrat Ive been a Democrat elected official a party official and an active party member so I know how Democrats think Democrats know and internalize understand and are motivated by certain ideas concepts and principles that seem to be foreign to Republicans And Democrats are elated that Republicans dont know or function under the same ideas These basic rules of Democratic thinking are at work in Florida This primer should help explain what makes the Democrats tick Rule If

Presidential Contest While the Gore campaign says dimpled ballots must be counted because every voter obviously intended to vote in the Presidential contest FOX NEWS reports that at least of voters told exit pollsters on November that they did not vote in the presidential race Experts say this understates the actual percentage of people who voted in down ballot races but NOT in the presidential contest The number of undervoters in the three Florida recount counties the Gore campaign is trying to mine for additional votes is roughly well within the range suggested by the exit polls From the

Democratic Aides Rally to His Cause By GLENN R SIMPSON TOM HAMBURGER and LAURIE COHEN Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Beginning of article omited One battletested Democratic consultant has even begun a quiet intelligencegathering operation that could aid a lastditch Gore strategy in the Electoral College Bob Beckel who managed Walter Mondales Democratic presidential campaign and has close ties to Mr Christopher has been checking into the background of Republican electors with an eye toward persuading a handful of them to vote for Mr Gore If Mr Bush eventually prevails in Florida but wins none other of the most closely contested states he would have electoral votes Three GOP defections could make Mr Gore president It is information gathering on my part using my own network Mr Beckel said confirming an operation he set in motion days after the Nov election I call on mostly Democrats but some Republicans too and ask Who are these electors and what do you know about them I just wanted to know who these electors are Mr Beckel who owns a politicalanalysis business based in Arlington Va said he is working independently on an adhoc basis and hasnt yet contacted any electors

the weekend Al Gores campaign has waged an allout effort to disqualify military absentee ballots and almost succeeded in throwing out over in all Military absentees were running heavily in favor of Governor Bush so they became a shoottokill target for winatallcosts Democrat operatives The articles below one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York Post amply demonstrate this Democratic vote scheme The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide A leaked five page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details precise instructions to Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on technicalities And as the ballots were counted in one county the Chicago Sun Times source noted Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality Such tactics are shameful This has been an exceptionally close election On Election Day George W Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast and counted ballots in Florida and with Floridas electors a majority of the Electoral College Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting Democrat judges to rewrite Floridas election laws after the fact to permit partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots That is bad enough but to selectively target our men and women in

NOVAK SUNTIMES COLUMNIST WASHINGTONIt was am in Jacksonville Fla Saturday when two Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each other The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee ballots of US service personnel Their defect no postmarks The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by Republicans an irony reflective of the fight for Florida Befuddled Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats following the letter of the law Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win Floridaand the presidency While granting maximum latitude in divining intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast the predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude When Al Gore and George W Bush finished in a Florida dead heat Republicans viewed it like a normal recount Democrats in contrast treated it like a continuation of the campaign Gores operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic They calculated that the vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gores deficit on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed votes The Gore campaign worked to make sure that did not happen Mark Herron a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the Gore campaign legal effort last Wednesday sent off a fivepage letter to colleagues around the state addressed to FDP Florida Democratic Party Lawyer The subject Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest It amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the servicemans vote It worked In Jacksonville officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a postmark Consequently plenty of sailors lost their vote at Saturday morning including for example Donnie Haynes Michael Gentry and Clifford Shearer from the USS George Washington Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at pm Friday after seven and onehalf hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this memo Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality In Broward County overseas ballots were accepted and rejected In MiamiDade County out of were turned down Statewide ballots were accepted and rejected As a result Bushs net overseas gain was only for an overall Florida lead of That meant only votes need be won by Gore in the handcounting of heavily Democratic Broward MiamiDade and Palm Beach counties They were working hard at it David Fulcher a lawyer from Jackson Miss sent to Palm Beach to help out described to me a scene of chaos and confusionof Bush ballots put in the Gore pile followed by protests and arguments It became clear at midweek however that Palm Beach would not yield enough new Gore votes Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in Broward and MiamiDade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand recounts But late Saturday when Gore planners became concerned about surpassing the vote margin in the three counties the rules were suddenly changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who failed to make a hole in the punch card See the full article at outputnovaknovakhtml THE FLORIDA CIRCUS HAS AL NO DECENCY John Podhoretz The New York Post SundayNovember IF the butterfly ballot in Floridas Palm Beach County had led to the disqualification of percent of the countys presidential votes Republicans wouldnt be protesting the manual recount there There would have been no question in everyones mind that some combination of ballot irregularity manipulation and outright fraud had taken place But only percent of the Palm Beach ballots were invalidated It now appears that percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated Democrats are convinced that their outrage on behalf of Al Gore and his position as the supposedly true winner of Florida is justified largely because of the furor that arose on the day after the election from the butterflyballot controversy How do they feel today knowing that let me say it again and in boldface type Forty percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated It also appears that most of those invalidated votes came from enlistees in the US military as the result of a coordinated Democratic strategy designed by Tallahassee lawyer Mark Herron who is involved in various Gore voter lawsuits Heres what this means Al Gore who is by all accounts totally and intimately involved in every aspect of the process underway in Florida may well have approved an effort to challenge every absentee vote in Florida cast by the servicemen and servicewomen whose commanderinchief he will become if he is sworn in as president I have no doubt that the challenges are legal Florida tightened its absenteevote procedures after massive fraud in led to the illegitimate election of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez whom a judge removed from office when the extent of his campaigns grave offense against the US electoral system became clear Republicans who have been hewing to the letter of the law in making their argument against the hand recounts in four Democratic counties are not exactly in a position to argue for greater leniency on these military ballots Such an affirmativeaction claim would make a mockery of George W Bushs own argument in federal court that the hand count violates the th amendments equalprotection clause But the Gore campaigns conduct makes an even greater mockery of the vice presidents insistence on a full fair and accurate count Again this cannot be said often enough percent of the overseas and absentee ballots have been invalidated as a direct result of a Democratic strategy intended to benefit the vice president Republicans will be falling all over themselves to accuse the vice president of hypocrisy which is becoming the most tiresome game of this postelection season Let me stipulate that there is indeed hypocrisy on both sides The real issue in the matter of the absentee ballots is the very deep and very very dark cynicism of Gores efforts to make himself president In pursuit of this ambition imprinted on him at birth Al Gore really is willing to do just about anything The vice president has now proved himself capable of actively seeking the disenfranchisement of military voters out of fear that they might have voted for his rival the challenges had to be issued before the envelopes were opened None of those Florida residents can now be sure that his or her vote was ever counted Email mailto See the full article at wwwnypostcom

send your contribution to Republican National Committee First Street SE Washington DC Thank you Sincerely Jim Nicholson Chairman Republican National Committee Washington Post Friday November Page A Not by Hand By Charles Krauthammer There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many other states to count ballots The reason is not only speed and efficiency but fairness Of course machines make mistakes but the mistakes are distributed randomly There is no premeditation no search for advantage Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were doublepunched underpunched or otherwise spoiled in Florida But machines read such errors with scrupulous impartiality The same cannot be said of hand counting Hand counting is arbitrary open to manipulation and abuse Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines not humans When humans try the results as we have seen in Palm Beach range from the arbitrary to the bizarre Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners holding up cards to the light trying to divine the intent of voters Hence the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare that dimpled chadsa slight indentation in the piece of paper one is supposed to punch through even slighter than the now legendary pregnant chadmust be counted as a vote Second a manual recount subjects computer cards literally to manipulation Under this method the presidency of the United States hangs by a thread the thread holding the dangling chad Any waving shuffling rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread dislodge the chad and produce a vote This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly neutral They are not The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats The counties now seeking to conduct these recountsPalm Beach and Browardare controlled by Democrats The decision regarding the legality of every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or majority Democratic These counties moreover are two of the most heavily Democratic in the state They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in and that was the biggest landslide of our time Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether to recount the entire county Two of the test districts voted to for Gore the third to Brezhnev never did that well In such heavily Democratic districts there is no way a recount will not produce more net votes for Gore You simply expand or narrow your criteria for voter intentand produce whatever number you need to win What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida The fairest is a statewide machine countand recount Why Because the errors balance out What about a statewide manual recount an option offered by Gore in his televised Nov gambit It has two disabling liabilities First it vastly multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias Thousands of people in thousands of precincts handling millions of cardscards that can be manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease There just arent enough watchdogs to watch all the partisans See the full

has opened up a Pandoras box of inconsistent standards flawed hand counting and delays that call into question Floridas ability to be represented in the Electoral College Further the courts narrow liberal majority has made a mockery of the idea of counting every vote by selecting only certain ballots and providing no standard to count them The four activist justices rewrote Floridas election laws after the election a clear violation of federal law Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and forceful dissent concluding The majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return the case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis Judge Wells said the countyby county decisionmaking on the clear indication of the intent of the voter is fraught with equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts or Congress For example in MiamiDade County the justices reinstated votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts conducted in only some precincts all of them overwhelmingly Democratic This would be the ultimate in treating some votes differently from others The Court ordered a recount of all counties undervotes but there are five major problems First in many counties the undervotes arent even segregated so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated We know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other degradation of ballots Second counties dont even know which of their nonvotes are undervotes and which are overvotes Third even in counties that have attempted to separate the undervote there are serious problems In MiamiDade the number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is different from the number identified in the November machine recount There can be no confidence that the pool of undervotes is untainted and consistent Fourth the majority accepted two different standards the liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach standard further proving votes are treated differently in each county Fifth as Chief Justice Wells said the liberal court majority failed to make provision for the qualifications of those who count what standards are used in the countare they the same standards for all ballots statewide or a continuation of the countyby county constitutionally suspect

FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A BAKER III December Ladies and Gentlemen This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee Two Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots in Seminole and Martin counties A federal judge ordering the counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were not counted for technical reasons And of course the disappointing to decision of the Florida Supreme Court just announced which will require manually recounting tens of thousands of nonvotes and undervotes in all Florida counties that have not yet had a manual recount and trying to do so by December This is what happens when for the first time in modern history a candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of an election for President It is very sad For Florida for the nation and for our democracy Todays ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of course a disappointment Its reasoning and result place the Court once again at odds with sound judgments of Floridas lower courts the Florida Legislature local election officials and in our view the US Supreme Court This action will unfortunately produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise Floridas votes in the Electoral College The ruling of the Florida Courts four justices is flawed in much the same way we think as its November ruling that was vacated unanimously by the United States Supreme Court Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his dissent today Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return this case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from either MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at any time until the issuance of this opinion The prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis I have to conclude that there is a real and present likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial damage to our country our state and to this Court as an institution pp We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of the other four We believe this ruling is inconsistent with Florida law federal law and the United States Constitution Therefore we have no alternative other than to appeal once again to the United States Supreme Court for relief We have already put in motion the process to do so WHAT THEYRE SAYING Judge Andrew Napolitano Fox News Legal Analyst what is this doing Changing the rules yet again in the face of a federal law that says you cant change counting

Theyre going to be reversed byhe predicts they will be reversed by the US Supreme Court and also projectstalks about a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this So if the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on theyve got it in this dissent John Gibson Mike Isikoff a crucial question is here What standard is this recount going to be counted under Any clue Mike Isikoff No

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are under a reasonable interpretation of Florida law legally cast votes The counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner and to the country by casting a cloud upon what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election Count first and rule upon legality afterwards is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires Another issue in this case moreover is the propriety indeed the constitutionality of letting the standard for determination of voters intent dimpled chad hanging chads etc vary from county to county as the Florida Supreme court opinion as interpreted by the Circuit Court permits If petitioner Bush is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful permitting the count to

outstanding men and women confirmed by the United States Senate Some of Presidentelect Bushs nominees are being unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from you One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft Presidentelect Bushs choice for Attorney General The hallmark of Senator Ashcrofts long history of public service has been integrity As Attorney General he will uphold the law and make the Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of He brings a unique record of service to this challenge He was twice elected Missouris Attorney General serving with both Republican and Democrat Governors He was elected Governor of Missouri an important swing state and then reelected with of the vote John then was elected to the US Senate where he just finished a sixyear term No other Attorney General has ever had this wealth of experience John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues including Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri Attorney Generals office by attracting strong men and women to serve his state and strictly upholding the law As Senator coSponsored the Violence Against Women Act As Governor signed Missouris first HateCrimes Bill and fought to protect victims rights Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor Made Education Reform a

minorities Appointed many AfricanAmericans to Missouris courts Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King holiday Created an award honoring George Washington Carvers Accomplishments saved Lincoln College an historic Black college founded by AfricanAmerican veterans of the Civil War Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge Every Republican Senator opposed Whites confirmation in part because he urged a lower legal standard for a man convicted of firstdegree murder times including the first degree murder of three police officers Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he disagrees This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new Administration Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to carry out the letter of the law He will restore the rule of law to the Justice Department and run a highly professional department Please do two things First let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation process for John Ashcroft Go to senatorssenatorbystatecfm to find the contact information for the

White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge Every Republican Senator opposed Whites confirmation in part because he urged a lower legal standard for a man convicted of firstdegree murder times including the first degree murder of three police officers Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he disagrees This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new

Bush While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative campaigning Forbes won the district by more than votes The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush Democrats were desperate to win but Republicans won another victory in a swing district To give you a bit of historical perspective there have been special elections over the past years Only of those special elections resulted in a change of party representation for the seat and only three of those swung toward the party of the President Historical odds were not in his favor but Representativeelect Forbes

below The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to other closely contested states We are confident of victory but we need your help George W Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast ballots in Florida and with Floridas electors a majority of the Electoral College All the Democrat maneuvering in the courts in the streets on television is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can count thousands of improper ballots We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election The RNC has sent staff to Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa New Mexico Oregon and Wisconsin as well We are fighting a multifront war and it is expensive These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted and they come at a time when the RNCs resources have been depleted by the election Thats why Im asking for your help again today Ive included two

send your contribution to Republican National Committee First Street SE Washington DC Thank you Sincerely Jim Nicholson Chairman Republican National Committee Washington Post Friday November Page A Not by Hand By Charles Krauthammer There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many other states to count ballots The reason is not only speed and efficiency but fairness Of course machines make mistakes but the mistakes are distributed randomly There is no premeditation no search for advantage Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were doublepunched underpunched or otherwise spoiled in Florida But machines read such errors with scrupulous impartiality The same cannot be said of hand counting Hand counting is arbitrary open to manipulation and abuse Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines not humans When humans try the results as we have seen in Palm Beach range from the arbitrary to the bizarre Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners holding up cards to the light trying to divine the intent of voters Hence the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare that dimpled chadsa slight indentation in the piece of paper one is supposed to punch through even slighter than the now legendary pregnant chadmust be counted as a vote Second a manual recount subjects computer cards literally to manipulation Under this method the presidency of the United States hangs by a thread the thread holding the dangling chad Any waving shuffling rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread dislodge the chad and produce a vote This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly neutral They are not The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats The counties now seeking to conduct these recountsPalm Beach and Browardare controlled by Democrats The decision regarding the legality of every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or majority Democratic These counties moreover are two of the most heavily Democratic in the state They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in and that was the biggest landslide of our time Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether to recount the entire county Two of the test districts voted to for Gore the third to Brezhnev never did that well In such heavily Democratic districts there is no way a recount will not produce more net votes for Gore You simply expand or narrow your criteria for voter intentand produce whatever number you need to win What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida The fairest is a statewide machine countand recount Why Because the errors balance out What about a statewide manual recount an option offered by Gore in his televised Nov gambit It has two disabling liabilities First it vastly multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias Thousands of people in thousands of precincts handling millions of cardscards that can be manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease There just arent enough watchdogs to watch all the partisans See the full article at SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times To scrounge for every last vote Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with tough seasoned Democrats the

far away in an abandoned Payless shoe store vanloads of AFLCIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York Chicago Nashville Philadelphia San Francisco and elsewhere had disembarked to learn how to

the weekend Al Gores campaign has waged an allout effort to disqualify military absentee ballots and almost succeeded in throwing out over in all Military absentees were running heavily in favor of Governor Bush so they became a shoottokill target for winatallcosts Democrat operatives The articles below one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York Post amply demonstrate this Democratic vote scheme The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide A leaked five page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details precise instructions to Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on technicalities And as the ballots were counted in one county the Chicago Sun Times source noted Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality Such tactics are shameful This has been an exceptionally close election On Election Day George W Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast and counted ballots in Florida and with Floridas electors a majority of the Electoral College Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting Democrat judges to rewrite Floridas election laws after the fact to permit partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots That is bad enough but to selectively target our men and women in

NOVAK SUNTIMES COLUMNIST WASHINGTONIt was am in Jacksonville Fla Saturday when two Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each other The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee ballots of US service personnel Their defect no postmarks The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by Republicans an irony reflective of the fight for Florida Befuddled Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats following the letter of the law Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win Floridaand the presidency While granting maximum latitude in divining intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast the predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude When Al Gore and George W Bush finished in a Florida dead heat Republicans viewed it like a normal recount Democrats in contrast treated it like a continuation of the campaign Gores operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic They calculated that the vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gores deficit on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed votes The Gore campaign worked to make sure that did not happen Mark Herron a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the Gore campaign legal effort last Wednesday sent off a fivepage letter to colleagues around the state addressed to FDP Florida Democratic Party Lawyer The subject Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest It amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the servicemans vote It worked In Jacksonville officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a postmark Consequently plenty of sailors lost their vote at Saturday morning including for example Donnie Haynes Michael Gentry and Clifford Shearer from the USS George Washington Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at pm Friday after seven and onehalf hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this memo Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality In Broward County overseas ballots were accepted and rejected In MiamiDade County out of were turned down Statewide ballots were accepted and rejected As a result Bushs net overseas gain was only for an overall Florida lead of That meant only votes need be won by Gore in the handcounting of heavily Democratic Broward MiamiDade and Palm Beach counties They were working hard at it David Fulcher a lawyer from Jackson Miss sent to Palm Beach to help out described to me a scene of chaos and confusionof Bush ballots put in the Gore pile followed by protests and arguments It became clear at midweek however that Palm Beach would not yield enough new Gore votes Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in Broward and MiamiDade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand recounts But late Saturday when Gore planners became concerned about surpassing the vote margin in the three counties the rules were suddenly changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who failed to make a hole in the punch card See the full article at outputnovaknovakhtml THE FLORIDA CIRCUS HAS AL NO DECENCY John Podhoretz The New York Post SundayNovember IF the butterfly ballot in Floridas Palm Beach County had led to the disqualification of percent of the countys presidential votes Republicans wouldnt be protesting the manual recount there There would have been no question in everyones mind that some combination of ballot irregularity manipulation and outright fraud had taken place But only percent of the Palm Beach ballots were invalidated It now appears that percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated Democrats are convinced that their outrage on behalf of Al Gore and his position as the supposedly true winner of Florida is justified largely because of the furor that arose on the day after the election from the butterflyballot controversy How do they feel today knowing that let me say it again and in boldface type Forty percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated It also appears that most of those invalidated votes came from enlistees in the US military as the result of a coordinated Democratic strategy designed by Tallahassee lawyer Mark Herron who is involved in various Gore voter lawsuits Heres what this means Al Gore who is by all accounts totally and intimately involved in every aspect of the process underway in Florida may well have approved an effort to challenge every absentee vote in Florida cast by the servicemen and servicewomen whose commanderinchief he will become if he is sworn in as president I have no doubt that the challenges are legal Florida tightened its absenteevote procedures after massive fraud in led to the illegitimate election of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez whom a judge removed from office when the extent of his campaigns grave offense against the US electoral system became clear Republicans who have been hewing to the letter of the law in making their argument against the hand recounts in four Democratic counties are not exactly in a position to argue for greater leniency on these military ballots Such an affirmativeaction claim would make a mockery of George W Bushs own argument in federal court that the hand count violates the th amendments equalprotection clause But the Gore campaigns conduct makes an even greater mockery of the vice presidents insistence on a full fair and accurate count Again this cannot be said often enough percent of the overseas and absentee ballots have been invalidated as a direct result of a Democratic strategy intended to benefit the vice president Republicans will be falling all over themselves to accuse the vice president of hypocrisy which is becoming the most tiresome game of this postelection season Let me stipulate that there is indeed hypocrisy on both sides The real issue in the matter of the absentee ballots is the very deep and very very dark cynicism of Gores efforts to make himself president In pursuit of this ambition imprinted on him at birth Al Gore really is willing to do just about anything The vice president has now proved himself capable of actively seeking the disenfranchisement of military voters out of fear that they might have voted for his rival the challenges had to be issued before the envelopes were opened None of those Florida residents can now be sure that his or her vote was ever counted Email mailto See the full article at wwwnypostcom

outrageous Already Al Gore has flooded Florida with lawyers attempting to win in court what he lost at the ballot box He is pushing for partisan rigged recounts in Democrat controlled counties He is

even begun a quiet intelligencegathering operation that could aid a lastditch Gore strategy in the Electoral College Bob Beckel who managed Walter Mondales Democratic presidential campaign and has close ties to Mr Christopher has been checking into the background of Republican electors with an eye toward persuading a handful of them to vote for Mr Gore If Mr Bush eventually prevails in Florida but wins none other of the most closely contested states he would have electoral votes Three GOP defections could make Mr Gore president It is information gathering on my part using my own network Mr Beckel said confirming an operation he set in motion days after the Nov election I call on mostly Democrats but some Republicans too and ask Who are these electors and what do you know about them I

your friends and family Thank you Contents US Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Bush Appeal Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For MiamiDade Recount Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots What About Todays Action on Military Ballots The Greenwood Position Now We Must Fight for Our Country Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt Wall Street Journal How Democrats Wage Political War Exit Polling Says At Least Of Americans Did Not Vote In Presidential Contest Voting Instructions Were Clear in Palm Beach County The US Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the Florida presidential recount saying Friday it will hear one of George W Bushs appeals that seeks to bar handcounted ballots in the disputed election In a stunning development and a victory for Bush the nations highest court said it will hear arguments Dec on whether to overturn the Florida Supreme Courts decision that allowed manually recounted votes to be added to Floridas vote total Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For MiamiDade Recount We are pleased with the Supreme Court decision It was our strong belief that the Florida Supreme Court would deny this motion The court had already extended the statutory deadline for an additional days and Al Gore was asking them to extend it yet again Thursday night Al Gore thanked the canvassing boards for their hard work and praised the Supreme Court decision Since then he has sued one of those canvassing boards and asked the Supreme Court to change its mind It seems Al Gore wants the Court to keep extending the deadline until he can count the votes enough times to change the result Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots The Illinois Supreme Court Ruling was incorrectly cited by the Gore campaign and the Florida Supreme Court and does NOT require dimpled ballots to be counted In fact in the Illinois case dimpled ballots were not counted at all Illinois attorney Burton Odelson who represented the challenger in the Illinois case said the judge did not count ballots that were indented because he could not determine the voters intent Contrary to the arguments made by David Boies for the Gore campaign Cook County Circuit Judge Francis Barth said I dont believe the fact that an impression standing alone counts necessarily that this voter intended then to vote Of the disputed ballots the Illinois Supreme Court ordered Judge Barth to examine he rejected nine dimpled ballots because as he said the dents were insufficient to prove the voters intent He rejected four others with pinholes that were misaligned accepted three hanging chads in which the perforation was partially attached and approved five ballots punctured by pinholes Six disputed ballots were withdrawn Michael Levelle a Democrat lawyer representing the Republican candidate in Illinois initially signed an affidavit on behalf of the Gore campaign saying to the best of his recollection he believed Judge Barth counted indented ballots But when later told that Judge Barth did not include dimpled ballots Levelle recanted I couldnt remember details The affidavit was more general than specific What About Todays Action on Military Ballots To protect the rights of our military men and women to have their votes count the BushCheney campaign today is asking a Florida Circuit Court in Tallahassee to require canvassing boards to immediately go back and review overseas military ballots for inclusion in the final vote tally We urge Al Gore to support this action One week ago tonight in an orchestrated effort that included a fivepage memo by a Gore attorney Al Gores supporters objected to as many military ballots as they could find The Gore campaign never should have knocked out the votes of the men and women who wear our nations uniform Thats no way to treat the men and women who serve our country They never should have taken that action in the first place Today is the day to right this wrong A State Judge will conduct a hearing at today in Leon County to hear our case We hope the Judge will ask the Boards to review these military ballots so our servicemen and women arent disenfranchised Given the remarks made about counting military ballots by Senator Lieberman Floridas Democratic Senator Bob Graham and Floridas Democratic Attorney General and chairman of Gores Florida campaign Bob Butterworth we cant imagine the Gore campaign will once again oppose the voting rights of our servicemen and women The Greenwood Position Now we must fight for our country BY PEGGY NOONAN Friday November We must fight And we all know it And its fine We like to complain those of us of a certain age that history has never given us the gaudy challenges it gave our parents and grandparents But weve had our traumas and from the time we were children assassinations riots Vietnam Watergate the ayatollah a stuck economy the fall of the wall Weve had our moments And now we face a great trial And were up to it So lets go Full Story columnistspnoonanid Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt By Richard Cohen Friday November I voted for Al Gore I did so because I have known him since he was a congressman from Tennessee I admire his intellect his seriousness of purpose his capacity for hard work and study his political values his experience and his knowledge That being said I now think that under current circumstances he would not be the right man for the presidency If I could I would withdraw my vote In the terminology of the moment put me down as a hanging chad I still think precisely as I have about Gore But those current circumstances I just mentioned change everything Given the present bitterness given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator a likable guy who will make things better and not worse That man is not Al Gore That man is George W Bush Bush has incessantly proclaimed himself as that sort of guya uniter not a divider The tendency is to dismiss that sort of chestthumping as campaign nonsense but in Bushs case it appears to be true After all the Bush boomlet began among his fellow Republican governors each of whom probably thought the next president should be none other than himself So it says something about Bush that the governors were able to coalesce around him Some of these governors knew Bush quite well some hardly at all but the fact remains that they all seemed to genuinely like the guy and respected his leadership abilities You hear the same sort of thing from people who worked with Bush in private enterprise I talked with one of them once a Democrat who disagreed with Bush on many issues Yet he too praised Bushs leadership abilities his talent for bringing order out of chaos and for reaching some sort of consensus That mans testimony impressed me His disagreements with Bush were real his admiration for him profound Gore on the other hand has little of those abilities His own party is sore at him for taking the onetwo punch of peace and prosperity and running a race that is still not concluded His performance was as erratic as his uniformoftheday earth tones on Tuesday business suit on Wednesday The country sensed that either he did not know himself or what he did know the country would not like Full Story wpdynarticlesANovhtml

political strategy so nothing about Florida should surprise anyone who has spent time in the Democratic Party Until I was a Democrat Ive been a Democrat elected official a party official and an active

elated that Republicans dont know or function under the same ideas These basic rules of Democratic thinking are at work in Florida This primer should help explain what makes the Democrats tick Rule If

Presidential Contest While the Gore campaign says dimpled ballots must be counted because every voter obviously intended to vote in the Presidential contest FOX NEWS reports that at least of voters told exit pollsters on November that they did not vote in the presidential race Experts say this understates the actual percentage of people who voted in down ballot races but NOT in the presidential

Concede Statement by Governor George W Bush The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones Our nation watched as we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote We were reminded of the strength of our democracy that while our system is not always perfect it is fundamentally strong and far better than any other alternative The election was close but tonight after a count a recount and yet another manual recount Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida which gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election We will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to serve as Americas next President and Vice President Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by James A Baker III Ladies and Gentlemen Shortly after I arrived here some days ago I said here in this very room that the election process in Florida and in the country as a whole needed to conclude with fairness and finality I suggested that everyone step back pause and think about what was at stake I warned that there might be no reasonable end to the process of counts challenges and contests if it slipped away from us So here is the account of the past weeks Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford Democrat Member of Floridas Election Canvassing Commission Thank you Madam Secretary Let me first commend you on the job that you and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the election This has been a tough election It has not always been pretty But we got the job done and we got it done right People called me and sayparticularly from out of stateand say whats going on down in Florida and I have to keep reminding people the only thing thats going on here is that weve got a razorthin election for the most important job in the world And thats all it is After all the jokes after all of the anguish weve just got a close election And any state that had to go through this wouldve had the same problems I think that we have had But I think its over It should be over And maybe thats the important word there should You know Yogi Berra once said Its not over till its over Well its over and we have a winner and its time to move on Theres one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough legal talent to keep this tied up through Christmas But one thing the lawyers cant do for us and one thing the courts cant do for us They cant bring this country together again And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight its going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together again and I hope we can get on with that work soon And Im proud of the job that weve done here in the state Reaction to Governor Bushs Statement RE What Gore needs to consider The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like and that Gore requested Bush still won counting with Gores rules Gore has to consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at this and say Guys you had your shot the count the recount they changed the rules for you and you still did not win Its time to be magnanimous RE Governor Bushs Speech the tonewas perfect There was a persistence and a determination in what Governor Bush said but it was also incredibly conciliatory It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this and that probably goes to peoples hearts Bob Woodward on Larry King Live CNN Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court Says Expert Fox News Channel Fox News Brit Hume does the Gore team not have something to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on Friday Thatthat creates sort of a period of continuing a sort of unfinality if such a word exists National Journals Stuart Taylor Unless Im missing something that is completely hollow spin There is nothing what so ever I thinkthat the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore They could do some things for George W Bush but Al Gore hasnt asked them to do anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done But I dont think hes in the position to say Oh by the way could you order some more recounts So I think there is nothing ifGore runs out of ammunition Which I think he may well do before the Supreme Court of the United States gets to a hearing I think he has to give up because theres nothing Call To Action Florida tonight certified the votes cast in the Presidential Election giving its electoral votes to George W Bush George W Bush won the vote on election day and won the mandated recount He won on November after the inclusion of the overseas ballots Now he has won after the manual recount as directed by the Florida Supreme Court and the results have been certified If you believe this election should end and that endless lawsuits are not good for our country please call your Congressman and Senator regardless of their party affiliation and tell them that Al Gore should concede If you wish to unsubscribe from the eChampion mailing list simply click here partnerechampionsunsubscribeboxhtml To become an eChampion click here

friends and associates It is time for truth to prevail and for Gore to concede Thank you Jim Nicholson Chairman RNC SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT MYTH There are more than votes in MiamiDade that have never been counted David Boies There are over ballots that have never been counted once for the presidency of the United States Today Show FACT Every ballot in MiamiDade was counted at least twice once on election night and again during the automatic recount In every election there are a significant number of ballots that are cast by voters without choosing a candidate in every race on the ballot including races for President For example in this election of the voters in Idaho of the voters in Illinois and of the voters in Wyoming cast a ballot without registering a vote for President The votes actually according to their filing about which the Gore campaign has been complaining constitute only of the ballots cast in MiamiDade These ballots were counted twice they merely registered no vote for President This reality reflects common sense a voter may want to vote for a candidate for the Senate House or other office but be undecided about the choice for President In particular a voter who usually votes for candidates from one party may vote for local or statewide candidates but be uncomfortable with his or her partys choice for President and yet unwilling to vote for the other partys candidate So he or she might cast a ballot without marking a choice for President MYTH If you counted all the votes that already have been counted in some of the recount Gore would actually be ahead by votes FACT Democrats get to this number by adding unreported and unofficial votes from the late manual recount in Palm Beach and from the partial manual recount from MiamiDade and by subtracting the valid military overseas ballots and some of the certified votes from Nassau County The Florida Supreme Court set a deadline of pm on Sunday for completing manual recounts almost tripling the statutory time period for counting mandated by Floridas Legislature Palm Beach did not complete its manual recount by the Supreme Courts deadline MiamiDade returned to its original decision of not proceeding with a manual recount The interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade came from a selective recount of the most Democrat precincts Gore won these selected precincts by approximately to while Gore won the entire county only by to It would be unfair to use this interim change without counting Republican precincts too Precincts in MiamiDade including those with predominantly Hispanic and Cuban American voters favored Bush The Gore approach would treat these minorities in a discriminatory fashion Military overseas ballots that were valid under Florida and federal law should be counted Counties recognized this and counted them Even Joe Lieberman said that such military ballots should not be rejected Even if you add the interim gain for Gore in MiamiDade and the final manual recount of net for Gore in Palm Beach as reported by the NYT and then also subtract the over votes that belong to Bush in Nassau County see below Bush still wins by well over votes MYTH MiamiDade would have conducted a manual recount if not for the Republican mob that intimidated the canvassing board KLAIN We think already almost votes were counted in Dade County before the mob stopped the count But I think that to say that a mob can storm a counting facility stop a count and then thats going to provide the end because a partisan of the Bush campaign Ms Harris refuses to accept returns and cuts off the counting I dont think thats the kind of end that we have to American elections GMA FACT The record shows that the crowd was reacting to the Boards decision to move the recount behind closed doors where it could not be observed by the public or the media and to limit the recount to only a select set of the votes No Board member mentioned the protests as a factor in the decision and Judge Leahy of the Board has already stated clearly that he was not intimidated by the crowd The police made no arrests received no assault complaints and did not even instruct the crowd to desist The crowd was quieted promptly MYTH In Nassau County the board violated Florida law by adding votes from earlier tabulations that had been rejected by the board as illegal FACT On election night all the votes were counted but during the machine recount ballots were accidentally separated from the rest and not counted As a result Bush received fewer votes and Gore received fewer votes than on election night After the recount the Nassau County Board supervisor discovered her mistake and tried to correct it Because the Supreme Court of Florida had held the date open for final certification until Sunday at pm the Division of Elections informed the supervisor that she could revise the count to make it accurate The Board Democrats and Republican voted unanimously to certify the original election night count which included the ballots rather than the machine recount total which mistakenly omitted those ballots QUOTES Mr Gore the Wheel has Turned and its Time for this to End I think the vice president should take the high ground and hand it over Rep Julia Carson DIN Associated Press interview conducted over the phone Mr Gore End It Now Editorial headline in the Chicago Tribune Enough is enough For nations welfare Gore should accept loss Editorial headline in the San Diego UnionTribune I have grave doubts about whether it is wise for the country for the

withit had to be fair it had to be geared towards achieving a fair result not geared towards achieving a certain result the Democratic Party the Republican Party everybody agreed to the standard we had applied in reviewing these ballots It was only after about four days into it that the Democratic Party went back to court to try and you know basically have us change that standard because I guess

Recount News Contents Talking Points Summary of Florida Supreme Court Decision Help the Bush Cheney Florida Recount Effort Dissenting Opinion of Chief Justice Charles J Wells Statement By Secretary James Baker What Theyre Saying Well if youre a fan of chaos youre in Nirvana John Shubin Florida Elections Expert MSNBC SUMMARY OF FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECISION A deeply divided Florida Supreme Court has opened up a Pandoras box of inconsistent standards flawed hand counting and delays that call into question Floridas ability to be represented in the Electoral College Further the courts narrow liberal majority has made a mockery of the idea of counting every vote by selecting only certain ballots and providing no standard to count them The four activist justices rewrote Floridas election laws after the election a clear violation of federal law Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and forceful dissent concluding The majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return the case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis Judge Wells said the countyby county decisionmaking on the clear indication of the intent of the voter is fraught with equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts or Congress For example in MiamiDade County the justices reinstated votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts conducted in only some precincts all of them overwhelmingly Democratic This would be the ultimate in treating some votes differently from others The Court ordered a recount of all counties undervotes but there are five major problems First in many counties the undervotes arent even segregated so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated We know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other degradation of ballots Second counties dont even know which of their nonvotes are undervotes and which are overvotes Third even in counties that have attempted to separate the undervote there are serious problems In MiamiDade the number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is different from the number identified in the November machine recount There can be no confidence that the pool of undervotes is untainted and consistent Fourth the majority accepted two different standards the liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach standard further proving votes are treated differently in each county Fifth as Chief Justice Wells said the liberal court majority failed to make provision for the qualifications of those who count what standards are used in the countare they the same standards for all ballots statewide or a continuation of the countyby county constitutionally suspect standards who is to observe the count how one objects to the count who is entitled to object to the count whether a person may object to a counter the possible lack of personnel to conduct the count

Recounta DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J WELLS Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution Excerpt I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the majority However I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process I also believe that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution My succinct conclusion is that the majoritys decisionhas no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion The majority returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of undervotes on the basis of unknown or at best ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others the credentials qualifications and objectivity of whom are totally unknown That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority creates This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over continued judicial process I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos a professor of mathematics at Temple University when he wrote that the margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory no matter who wins Further judicial process will not change this selfevident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder Justice Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action sixtyfour years ago I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls Full Opinion fdwwwcnncomELECTIONresourcesflasc opinpdf STATEMENT BY FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A BAKER III December Ladies and Gentlemen This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee Two Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots in Seminole and Martin counties A federal judge ordering the counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were not counted for technical reasons And of course the disappointing to decision of the Florida Supreme Court just announced which will require manually recounting tens of thousands of nonvotes and undervotes in all Florida counties that have not yet had a manual recount and trying to do so by December This is what happens when for the first time in modern history a candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of an election for President It is very sad For Florida for the nation and for our democracy Todays ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of course a disappointment Its reasoning and result place the Court once again at odds with sound judgments of Floridas lower courts the Florida Legislature local election officials and in our view the US Supreme Court This action will unfortunately produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise Floridas votes in the Electoral College The ruling of the Florida Courts four justices is flawed in much the same way we think as its November ruling that was vacated unanimously by the United States Supreme Court Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his dissent today Ibelieve that the majoritys decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution The majoritys decision to return this case to the circuit court for a count of the undervotes from either MiamiDade County or all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November or at any time until the issuance of this opinion The prolonging of judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional crisis I have to conclude that there is a real and present likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial damage to our country our state and to this Court as an institution pp We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of the other four We believe this ruling is inconsistent with Florida law federal law and the United States Constitution Therefore we have no alternative other than to appeal once again to the United States Supreme Court for relief We have already put in motion the process to do so WHAT THEYRE SAYING Judge Andrew Napolitano Fox News Legal Analyst what is this doing Changing the rules yet again in the face of a federal law that says you cant change counting procedures and rules after six days prior to the election Fox News Channel Jim Axelrod CBS News Correspondent One of the first people I saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass a member of the Gore legal team I asked him what was next He said Chaos So far nothings been done to help clarify the situation CBS Evening News Tim Russert NBC News we could have chaos and a constitutional crisisThis is as close to a political civil war as Ive ever witnessed NBC Nightly News Mike Isikoff Newsweek Magazine The Republicans got a bit of a shot in the arm I was just reading the dissent of Chief Justice Wells on this case and he is pretty stinging It is surprising language from a chief justice of a state court He pretty much says flatly that his colleagues were wrong as a matter of law Theyre going to be reversed byhe predicts they will be reversed by the US Supreme Court and also projectstalks about a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this So if the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on theyve got it in this dissent John Gibson Mike Isikoff a crucial question is here What standard is this recount going to be counted under Any clue Mike Isikoff No

Concede Statement by Governor George W Bush The last nineteen days have been extraordinary ones Our nation watched as we were all reminded on a daily basis of the importance of each and every vote We were reminded of the strength of our democracy that while our system is not always perfect it is fundamentally strong and far better than any other alternative The election was close but tonight after a count a recount and yet another manual recount Secretary Cheney and I are honored and humbled to have won the state of Florida which gives us the needed electoral votes to win the election We will therefore undertake the responsibility of preparing to serve as Americas next President and Vice President Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by James A Baker III Ladies and Gentlemen Shortly after I arrived here some days ago I said here in this very room that the election process in Florida and in the country as a whole needed to conclude with fairness and finality I suggested that everyone step back pause and think about what was at stake I warned that there might be no reasonable end to the process of counts challenges and contests if it slipped away from us So here is the account of the past weeks Full statement NewsaspFormModeNRID Statement by Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford Democrat Member of Floridas Election Canvassing Commission Thank you Madam Secretary Let me first commend you on the job that you and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the election This has been a tough election It has not always been pretty But we got the job done and we got it done right People called me and sayparticularly from out of stateand say whats going on down in Florida and I have to keep reminding people the only thing thats going on here is that weve got a razorthin election for the most important job in the world And thats all it is After all the jokes after all of the anguish weve just got a close election And any state that had to go through this wouldve had the same problems I think that we have had But I think its over It should be over And maybe thats the important word there should You know Yogi Berra once said Its not over till its over Well its over and we have a winner and its time to move on Theres one thing that I am sure of and that is both sides have enough legal talent to keep this tied up through Christmas But one thing the lawyers cant do for us and one thing the courts cant do for us They cant bring this country together again And while we have a winner tonight and we have a loser tonight its going to take both of these gentlemen to bring this country together again and I hope we can get on with that work soon And Im proud of the job that weve done here in the state Reaction to Governor Bushs Statement RE What Gore needs to consider The rules were changed in a way that Bush did not like and that Gore requested Bush still won counting with Gores rules Gore has to consider where reasonable people in the center are going to look at this and say Guys you had your shot the count the recount they changed the rules for you and you still did not win Its time to be magnanimous RE Governor Bushs Speech the tonewas perfect There was a persistence and a determination in what Governor Bush said but it was also incredibly conciliatory It was the first kind of conciliatory speech that anybody has given in this and that probably goes to peoples hearts Bob Woodward on Larry King Live CNN Gore Just Spinning About Supreme Court Says Expert Fox News Channel Fox News Brit Hume does the Gore team not have something to work with here in the fact that we have the Supreme Court coming up on Friday Thatthat creates sort of a period of continuing a sort of unfinality if such a word exists National Journals Stuart Taylor Unless Im missing something that is completely hollow spin There is nothing what so ever I thinkthat the Supreme Court of the United States can do for Al Gore They could do some things for George W Bush but Al Gore hasnt asked them to do anything except uphold what the Florida Supreme Court has already done But I dont think hes in the position to say Oh by the way could you order some more recounts So I think there is nothing ifGore runs out of ammunition Which I think he may well do before the Supreme Court of the United States gets to a hearing I think he has to give up because theres nothing Call To Action Florida tonight certified the votes cast in the Presidential Election giving its electoral votes to George W Bush George W Bush won the vote on election day and won the mandated recount He won on November after the inclusion of the overseas ballots Now he has won after the manual recount as directed by the Florida Supreme Court and the results have been certified If you believe this election should end and that endless lawsuits are not good for our country please call your Congressman and Senator regardless of their party affiliation and tell them that Al Gore should concede If you wish to unsubscribe from the eChampion mailing list simply click here partnerechampionsunsubscribeboxhtml To become an eChampion click here

your friends and family Thank you Contents US Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Bush Appeal Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For MiamiDade Recount Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots What About Todays Action on Military Ballots The Greenwood Position Now We Must Fight for Our Country Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt Wall Street Journal How Democrats Wage Political War Exit Polling Says At Least Of Americans Did Not Vote In Presidential Contest Voting Instructions Were Clear in Palm Beach County The US Supreme Court agreed to intervene in the Florida presidential recount saying Friday it will hear one of George W Bushs appeals that seeks to bar handcounted ballots in the disputed election In a stunning development and a victory for Bush the nations highest court said it will hear arguments Dec on whether to overturn the Florida Supreme Courts decision that allowed manually recounted votes to be added to Floridas vote total Statement On Florida Supreme Court Rejection Of Gore Campaign Demand For MiamiDade Recount We are pleased with the Supreme Court decision It was our strong belief that the Florida Supreme Court would deny this motion The court had already extended the statutory deadline for an additional days and Al Gore was asking them to extend it yet again Thursday night Al Gore thanked the canvassing boards for their hard work and praised the Supreme Court decision Since then he has sued one of those canvassing boards and asked the Supreme Court to change its mind It seems Al Gore wants the Court to keep extending the deadline until he can count the votes enough times to change the result Facts On Illinois Ruling On Dimpled Ballots The Illinois Supreme Court Ruling was incorrectly cited by the Gore campaign and the Florida Supreme Court and does NOT require dimpled ballots to be counted In fact in the Illinois case dimpled ballots were not counted at all Illinois attorney Burton Odelson who represented the challenger in the Illinois case said the judge did not count ballots that were indented because he could not determine the voters intent Contrary to the arguments made by David Boies for the Gore campaign Cook County Circuit Judge Francis Barth said I dont believe the fact that an impression standing alone counts necessarily that this voter intended then to vote Of the disputed ballots the Illinois Supreme Court ordered Judge Barth to examine he rejected nine dimpled ballots because as he said the dents were insufficient to prove the voters intent He rejected four others with pinholes that were misaligned accepted three hanging chads in which the perforation was partially attached and approved five ballots punctured by pinholes Six disputed ballots were withdrawn Michael Levelle a Democrat lawyer representing the Republican candidate in Illinois initially signed an affidavit on behalf of the Gore campaign saying to the best of his recollection he believed Judge Barth counted indented ballots But when later told that Judge Barth did not include dimpled ballots Levelle recanted I couldnt remember details The affidavit was more general than specific What About Todays Action on Military Ballots To protect the rights of our military men and women to have their votes count the BushCheney campaign today is asking a Florida Circuit Court in Tallahassee to require canvassing boards to immediately go back and review overseas military ballots for inclusion in the final vote tally We urge Al Gore to support this action One week ago tonight in an orchestrated effort that included a fivepage memo by a Gore attorney Al Gores supporters objected to as many military ballots as they could find The Gore campaign never should have knocked out the votes of the men and women who wear our nations uniform Thats no way to treat the men and women who serve our country They never should have taken that action in the first place Today is the day to right this wrong A State Judge will conduct a hearing at today in Leon County to hear our case We hope the Judge will ask the Boards to review these military ballots so our servicemen and women arent disenfranchised Given the remarks made about counting military ballots by Senator Lieberman Floridas Democratic Senator Bob Graham and Floridas Democratic Attorney General and chairman of Gores Florida campaign Bob Butterworth we cant imagine the Gore campaign will once again oppose the voting rights of our servicemen and women The Greenwood Position Now we must fight for our country BY PEGGY NOONAN Friday November We must fight And we all know it And its fine We like to complain those of us of a certain age that history has never given us the gaudy challenges it gave our parents and grandparents But weve had our traumas and from the time we were children assassinations riots Vietnam Watergate the ayatollah a stuck economy the fall of the wall Weve had our moments And now we face a great trial And were up to it So lets go Full Story columnistspnoonanid Washington Post Gore Cant Heal the Hurt By Richard Cohen Friday November I voted for Al Gore I did so because I have known him since he was a congressman from Tennessee I admire his intellect his seriousness of purpose his capacity for hard work and study his political values his experience and his knowledge That being said I now think that under current circumstances he would not be the right man for the presidency If I could I would withdraw my vote In the terminology of the moment put me down as a hanging chad I still think precisely as I have about Gore But those current circumstances I just mentioned change everything Given the present bitterness given the angry irresponsible charges being hurled by both camps the nation will be in dire need of a conciliator a likable guy who will make things better and not worse That man is not Al Gore That man is George W Bush Bush has incessantly proclaimed himself as that sort of guya uniter not a divider The tendency is to dismiss that sort of chestthumping as campaign nonsense but in Bushs case it appears to be true After all the Bush boomlet began among his fellow Republican governors each of whom probably thought the next president should be none other than himself So it says something about Bush that the governors were able to coalesce around him Some of these governors knew Bush quite well some hardly at all but the fact remains that they all seemed to genuinely like the guy and respected his leadership abilities You hear the same sort of thing from people who worked with Bush in private enterprise I talked with one of them once a Democrat who disagreed with Bush on many issues Yet he too praised Bushs leadership abilities his talent for bringing order out of chaos and for reaching some sort of consensus That mans testimony impressed me His disagreements with Bush were real his admiration for him profound Gore on the other hand has little of those abilities His own party is sore at him for taking the onetwo punch of peace and prosperity and running a race that is still not concluded His performance was as erratic as his uniformoftheday earth tones on Tuesday business suit on Wednesday The country sensed that either he did not know himself or what he did know the country would not like Full Story wpdynarticlesANovhtml

the Gore campaignturnedlawfirm let there be no doubt that the goings on in Florida are perfectly in keeping with the way Democrats normally think and behave Lawsuits are a key part of the Democrats political strategy so nothing about Florida should surprise anyone who has spent time in the Democratic Party Until I was a Democrat Ive been a Democrat elected official a party official and an active party member so I know how Democrats think Democrats know and internalize understand and are motivated by certain ideas concepts and principles that seem to be foreign to Republicans And Democrats are elated that Republicans dont know or function under the same ideas These basic rules of Democratic thinking are at work in Florida This primer should help explain what makes the Democrats tick Rule If we dont win we dont eat Rule State courts are home to Democrats Rule the golden rule He who makes the rules wins the gold Full Story extraid Exit Polling Says At Least Of Americans Did Not Vote In Presidential Contest While the Gore campaign says dimpled ballots must be counted because every voter obviously intended to vote in the Presidential contest FOX NEWS reports that at least of voters told exit pollsters on November that they did not vote in the presidential race Experts say this understates the actual percentage of people who voted in down ballot races but NOT in the presidential contest The number of undervoters in the three Florida recount counties the Gore campaign is trying to mine for additional votes is roughly well within the range suggested by the exit polls From the

one of the most competitive Democraticleaning districts in America Virginias th Congressional District President Clinton won the th district in and and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in and even while they won statewide Despite the tough odds Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of President Bush While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative campaigning Forbes won the district by more than votes The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush Democrats were desperate to win but Republicans won another victory in a swing district To give you a bit of historical perspective there have been special elections over the past years Only of those special elections resulted in a change of party representation for the seat and only three of those swung toward the party of the President Historical odds were not in his favor but Representativeelect Forbes defied the odds So what does this historydefying Republican victory mean to us on a national level The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide momentum across the political spectrum for President Bushs agenda for America And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum You helped President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldnt be done a bipartisan trillion tax relief package The first round of tax relief checks was mailed yesterday and I sincerely appreciate your helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve If President

Governor Bush so they became a shoottokill target for winatallcosts Democrat operatives The articles below one from the Chicago Sun Times and one from the New York Post amply demonstrate this Democratic vote scheme The Gore effort to nullify the military vote was statewide A leaked five page memo from the Gore staff laid out the details precise instructions to Democrats in every county on how to challenge military ballots on technicalities And as the ballots were counted in one county the Chicago Sun Times source noted Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality Such tactics are shameful This has been an exceptionally close election On Election Day George W Bush received a majority of the legitimately cast and counted ballots in Florida and with Floridas electors a majority of the Electoral College Al Gore is now attempting to reverse the outcome of the election by getting Democrat judges to rewrite Floridas election laws after the fact to permit partisan Democrat officials to count thousands of improper ballots That is bad enough but to selectively target our men and women in

NOVAK SUNTIMES COLUMNIST WASHINGTONIt was am in Jacksonville Fla Saturday when two Democratic lawyers pumped their fists in the air and congratulated each other The local canvassing board had just thrown out overseas absentee ballots of US service personnel Their defect no postmarks The board disenfranchising the service personnel was controlled by Republicans an irony reflective of the fight for Florida Befuddled Republicans were acting like good bureaucrats following the letter of the law Delighted Democrats were part of a coolly crafted scheme to win Floridaand the presidency While granting maximum latitude in divining intentions of Democratic senior citizens on the south Florida Gold Coast the predominantly Republican votes of young men and women serving their country abroad would be scrutinized with no latitude When Al Gore and George W Bush finished in a Florida dead heat Republicans viewed it like a normal recount Democrats in contrast treated it like a continuation of the campaign Gores operatives have made no secret of their Florida arithmetic They calculated that the vote Bush statewide margin following the full machine recount would be erased by Gold Coast hand recounts so long as Gores deficit on overseas absentee ballots did not exceed votes The Gore campaign worked to make sure that did not happen Mark Herron a lawyer from the state capital of Tallahassee engaged in the Gore campaign legal effort last Wednesday sent off a fivepage letter to colleagues around the state addressed to FDP Florida Democratic Party Lawyer The subject Overseas Absentee Ballot Review and Protest It amounted to a quickie guide for tossing out the servicemans vote It worked In Jacksonville officials ignored an affidavit from an aircraft carrier postal clerk swearing that mail sent by naval personnel often lacks a postmark Consequently plenty of sailors lost their vote at Saturday morning including for example Donnie Haynes Michael Gentry and Clifford Shearer from the USS George Washington Brevard County Republican Chairman Ray Marino went home at pm Friday after seven and onehalf hours of inspecting overseas ballots and wrote this memo Gore had five attorneys there Their sole objective was to disenfranchise the military absentee votes They challenged each and every vote Their sole intent was to disqualify each and every absentee voter They constantly challenged military votes that were clearly legitimate but they were able to disqualify them on a technicality In Broward County overseas ballots were accepted and rejected In MiamiDade County out of were turned down Statewide ballots were accepted and rejected As a result Bushs net overseas gain was only for an overall Florida lead of That meant only votes need be won by Gore in the handcounting of heavily Democratic Broward MiamiDade and Palm Beach counties They were working hard at it David Fulcher a lawyer from Jackson Miss sent to Palm Beach to help out described to me a scene of chaos and confusionof Bush ballots put in the Gore pile followed by protests and arguments It became clear at midweek however that Palm Beach would not yield enough new Gore votes Pressure was successfully applied to canvassing boards in Broward and MiamiDade to reverse themselves and order countywide hand recounts But late Saturday when Gore planners became concerned about surpassing the vote margin in the three counties the rules were suddenly changed to permit easier tests for reading the intention of any voter who failed to make a hole in the punch card See the full article at outputnovaknovakhtml THE FLORIDA CIRCUS HAS AL NO DECENCY John Podhoretz The New York Post SundayNovember IF the butterfly ballot in Floridas Palm Beach County had led to the disqualification of percent of the countys presidential votes Republicans wouldnt be protesting the manual recount there There would have been no question in everyones mind that some combination of ballot irregularity manipulation and outright fraud had taken place But only percent of the Palm Beach ballots were invalidated It now appears that percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated Democrats are convinced that their outrage on behalf of Al Gore and his position as the supposedly true winner of Florida is justified largely because of the furor that arose on the day after the election from the butterflyballot controversy How do they feel today knowing that let me say it again and in boldface type Forty percent of Floridas overseas ballots have been invalidated It also appears that most of those invalidated votes came from enlistees in the US military as the result of a coordinated Democratic strategy designed by Tallahassee lawyer Mark Herron who is involved in various Gore voter lawsuits Heres what this means Al Gore who is by all accounts totally and intimately involved in every aspect of the process underway in Florida may well have approved an effort to challenge every absentee vote in Florida cast by the servicemen and servicewomen whose commanderinchief he will become if he is sworn in as president I have no doubt that the challenges are legal Florida tightened its absenteevote procedures after massive fraud in led to the illegitimate election of Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez whom a judge removed from office when the extent of his campaigns grave offense against the US electoral system became clear Republicans who have been hewing to the letter of the law in making their argument against the hand recounts in four Democratic counties are not exactly in a position to argue for greater leniency on these military ballots Such an affirmativeaction claim would make a mockery of George W Bushs own argument in federal court that the hand count violates the th amendments equalprotection clause But the Gore campaigns conduct makes an even greater mockery of the vice presidents insistence on a full fair and accurate count Again this cannot be said often enough percent of the overseas and absentee ballots have been invalidated as a direct result of a Democratic strategy intended to benefit the vice president Republicans will be falling all over themselves to accuse the vice president of hypocrisy which is becoming the most tiresome game of this postelection season Let me stipulate that there is indeed hypocrisy on both sides The real issue in the matter of the absentee ballots is the very deep and very very dark cynicism of Gores efforts to make himself president In pursuit of this ambition imprinted on him at birth Al Gore really is willing to do just about anything The vice president has now proved himself capable of actively seeking the disenfranchisement of military voters out of fear that they might have voted for his rival the challenges had to be issued before the envelopes were opened None of those Florida residents can now be sure that his or her vote was ever counted Email mailto See the full article at wwwnypostcom

election should be over But because the Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules the fight continues Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney urgently need your help To contribute immediately see form below The situation in Florida is unprecedented and the dispute may still spread to other closely contested states We are confident of victory but we need your help George W Bush and Dick Cheney clearly won the majority of legitimately cast ballots in Florida and with Floridas electors a majority of the Electoral College All the Democrat maneuvering in the courts in the streets on television is designed to confuse the public about that simple fact while throwing the election into a rigged process in which partisan Democrat officials can count thousands of improper ballots We MUST NOT let the Democrats steal this election The RNC has sent staff to Florida and other battleground states such as Iowa New Mexico Oregon and Wisconsin as well We are fighting a multifront war and it is expensive These costs are unexpected and unbudgeted and they come at a time when the RNCs resources have been depleted by the election Thats why Im asking for your help again today Ive included two

send your contribution to Republican National Committee First Street SE Washington DC Thank you Sincerely Jim Nicholson Chairman Republican National Committee Washington Post Friday November Page A Not by Hand By Charles Krauthammer There is a reason that machines have been chosen by Florida and so many other states to count ballots The reason is not only speed and efficiency but fairness Of course machines make mistakes but the mistakes are distributed randomly There is no premeditation no search for advantage Undoubtedly there were many presidential ballots that were doublepunched underpunched or otherwise spoiled in Florida But machines read such errors with scrupulous impartiality The same cannot be said of hand counting Hand counting is arbitrary open to manipulation and abuse Mechanical ballots are designed to be read by machines not humans When humans try the results as we have seen in Palm Beach range from the arbitrary to the bizarre Hence the comic contortions of the ballot examiners holding up cards to the light trying to divine the intent of voters Hence the spectacle of Gore supporters going to court to get a judge to declare that dimpled chadsa slight indentation in the piece of paper one is supposed to punch through even slighter than the now legendary pregnant chadmust be counted as a vote Second a manual recount subjects computer cards literally to manipulation Under this method the presidency of the United States hangs by a thread the thread holding the dangling chad Any waving shuffling rubbing or other movement can easily cut the thread dislodge the chad and produce a vote This would be true even if those judging the ballots were perfectly neutral They are not The counting by hand is in fact counting by Democrats The counties now seeking to conduct these recountsPalm Beach and Browardare controlled by Democrats The decision regarding the legality of every newfound Gore vote is made by a committee that is either entirely or majority Democratic These counties moreover are two of the most heavily Democratic in the state They went for Gore with majorities larger than that by which Lyndon Johnson won over Barry Goldwater in and that was the biggest landslide of our time Broward Democrats chose three sample precincts to decide whether to recount the entire county Two of the test districts voted to for Gore the third to Brezhnev never did that well In such heavily Democratic districts there is no way a recount will not produce more net votes for Gore You simply expand or narrow your criteria for voter intentand produce whatever number you need to win What is the fairest way to determine the winner in a state such as Florida The fairest is a statewide machine countand recount Why Because the errors balance out What about a statewide manual recount an option offered by Gore in his televised Nov gambit It has two disabling liabilities First it vastly multiplies the opportunity for fraud and bias Thousands of people in thousands of precincts handling millions of cardscards that can be manipulated and altered with ridiculous ease There just arent enough watchdogs to watch all the partisans See the full article at SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA Excerpts from The Los Angeles Times To scrounge for every last vote Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with tough seasoned Democrats the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to outdo their opponents Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue Not far away in an abandoned Payless shoe store vanloads of AFLCIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York Chicago Nashville Philadelphia San Francisco and elsewhere had disembarked to learn how to observe the ballot count Our goal said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new charges is to preserve the Al Gore vote The volunteers nodded Its very very important that if you see any kind of marka scratch a dent a pinprick in Al Gores columnthat you challenge When someone then asked what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent the lawyer said Keep your lips sealed It was hardball that the Bostonians and other importe d pros understood well Full Article newspoliticsdecisionlatdemshtm Dear Jim Yes Ill help I know Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney won on Election Day
