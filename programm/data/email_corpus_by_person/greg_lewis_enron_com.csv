Ill give it a try The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project Sunrise umbrella Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson Both of these people are originally from corp accounting I believe Jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC ETS has its own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone ETS Consolidations which reports to Rod Hayslett I believe this was originally set up to address ETS specific planningforecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working for Tracy Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Group which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfields organization I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well Lees team uses Hoang quite a bit as well Ill call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further Greg Original Message From Puetz Fred Sent Monday November PM To Lewis Greg Subject FW Adaytum Status Cheryl Perchal is going to coordinate a phone conference with you Teri Galissini and Hoang Vo sometime this week We have many questions not just how actuals could feed into Adaytum for current estimate You can maybe help me understand how project management is organized for ETSs Adaytum projects I understand Teri G is project lead Does she report to Rod Hayslett Is anyone from Steve Hottes area involved Is the project being capitalized or expensed No one here has anything like SOW project authorization capital project coding for timesheets status reporting etc Thanks Fred Original Message From Lewis Greg Sent Wednesday November PM To Puetz Fred Subject RE Adaytum Status Fred Im out of the office today but took a few minutes to check in and keep the mountain of email from piling too high With regard to the actuals item mentioned below this came to light when my team was doing research on developing cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse Next Wednesday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we will be asking the ISC supports sap adaytum data warehouse etc for an estimate and schedule Basically what we are shooting for is plan in the data warehouse to support cost centervariance reporting and actuals in Adaytum to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts I call you Monday and we can discuss further Have a good Thanksgiving Greg Original Message From Puetz Fred Sent Wed AM To Behrens Alan Mayer Tony Peters Jerry Cc Lewis Greg Subject FW Adaytum Status Ritas consultant rate is Hoangs rate is either or I dont like paying for redesign on a product that should handle large cubes I plan to talk with Greg Lewis about this issue Fred Original Message From Reed Debra Sent Tuesday November PM To Puetz Fred Cc Boggs Phil Perchal Cheryl Peters Jerry Subject Adaytum Status I am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on the Adaytum OM project I havent had a chance to talk to Phil on this so this is only my opinion on the project so far This will just be a brief rundown I can expand upon any of the items at your request Planned this week Call Hoang Vo on a couple issues See accomplished below Decipher what Rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be completed Understand the model Accomplished this week Called Hoang Vo on Issues Cant open large cubes Hoang knows this is a problem There is a similar issue with a Houston application which they need to redesign Importing to contributor after allocations ran Hoang is working on a script He will send to us once he has it finished Until then we could do it manually but Hoang would have to step us though this process taking away from his time writing the script Side note if we cant get the allocations back to contributor then the users me right now cant do much testing besides inputting Documentation Phil and I have been going through dlists and dcubes trying to determine the purpose of each Discovered some dlists and dcubes that we may not need and documented questions on others This written documentation should assist new users of our application Cube Renaming We have renamed the Merit SBP Model to just Merit Model This is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a simple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places for links and macros to still work Outstanding Issues Phil and I have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from Hoang or another consultant familiar with this application We are in need of a summary manager build and some sort of documented process on how to run this application I am not at all comfortable with the application in its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of In a phone conference this afternoon we were told that getting actuals into the Adaytum OM application would not be ready for January close ETS thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the Project Sunrise umbrella which is not the case Now ETS must champion this effort It is being headed up by Greg Lewis but there is not an estimated completion date Deb x Not everything that can be counted counts not everything that counts
