Eu Liberalisation Procedure and Substance of an Art Directive This email is for background information so that we can have a clear view on the prospects and content of an eventual Art Directive The current European Commissions Directive is based on Art of the Amsterdam Treaty this is an harmonisation Directive which means that it can address any issue likely to impede crossborder flows of goods and services and can have positive effects such as requirements to set up a regulator An Art Directive on the other hand can only address concerns within the context of Art Art stipulates that member States of the EU shall not favour government owned entities or other entities to whom public service obligations PSO have been assigned unless such favour is necesary for that entity to carry out its PSO Art Directives are prohibitive and preventative rather than prescriptive In short Art means that the competition rules apply to EdF and if the member state wont enforce a level field the Commission will In procedural terms Art Directives do not have to be passed by the Council member states nor by the Parliament though in practice the Commission does not act unilaterally and seeks tacit cover Thus in the Telecomms sector when the member States found it too hard politically to liberalise they engineered an impasse in Council and invited sotto voce the Commission to force them to do it In effect the Stockholm Councils Conclusions are a similar coded request the reference to competition rules would include Art Once before the College of the Commission an Art directive has to be agreed by simple a majority vote of all Commissioners even if they are absent so you need positive votes It cannot be blocked by a single Commissioner Even if FranceGermany combine there would be positive votes and four against What can an Art Directive do Enforce accounts and management unbundling not legal unbundling as that entails change of ownership Abolish any exclusive rights that have an anticompetitive effect such as exclusive use of infrastructure rights to importexport interconnector rights Broadly speaking force liberalisation in a utilities sector What an Art Directive cannot do Force any legal person to do anything companies individuals etc Only States can be addressed Address positive regulatory issues set tariffs create regulators capacity upgrades etc In Summary An Art directive would be different from the directive already on the table it would be more focussed and less general and would provide remedies for identified anticompetitive activities Action We should be in a position to place before the Commission an array of anticompetitive actions that can be remedied by an Art Directive especially with regard to exclusive rights Brendan Devlin

directive would be different from the directive already on the table it would be more focussed and less general and would provide remedies for identified anticompetitive activities Action We should be in a position to place before the Commission an array of anticompetitive actions that can be remedied by an Art Directive especially with regard to exclusive rights Brendan Devlin
