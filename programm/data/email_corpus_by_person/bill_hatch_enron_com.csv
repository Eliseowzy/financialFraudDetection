SubjectFwd Well go forward from this moment Although Ive received and read countless emails on Tuesdays tragedy I ha ve forwarded few because I know youre all receiving just as many and oft en the same ones over and over like I am This one however I feel compe lled to forward because it says far better than I ever could how I feel ab out our country and being an American Lile NATO said attack one of us and we put aside our differences and band together stronger than any foe or fear we might face Tracy Date PM From Linda Driscoll Published Wednesday September Well go forward from this moment Leonard J Pitts Jr The Miami Herald Its my job to have something to say They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles th e American soul But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes the only thing I can find to say the only words that seem to fit must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering You monster You beast You unspeakable bastard What lesson did you hope to teach us by your cowards attack on our World Trade Center our Pentagon us What was it you hoped we would learn Whatever it was please know that you failed Did you want us to respect your cause You just damned your cause Did you want to make us fear You just steeled our resolve Did you want to tear us apart You just brought us together Let me tell you about my people We are a vast and quarrelsome family a family rent by racial social political and class division but a family nonetheless Were frivolous yes capable of expending tremendous emotiona l energy on pop cultural minutiae a singers revealing dress a ball team s misfortune a cartoon mouse Were wealthy too spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods and maybe because of that we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement We are fundamentally decent though peaceloving and compassionate We struggle to know the right thing and to do it And we are the overwhelming majority of us people of faith believers in a just and loving God Some people you perhaps think that any or all of this makes us weak Youre mistaken We are not weak Indeed we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals IN PAIN Yes were in pain now We are in mourning and we are in shock Were still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did still working to make ourselves understand that this isnt a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster isnt the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United States and probably the history of the world Youve bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before But theres a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last tim e anyone hit us this hard the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain When roused we are righteous in our outrage terrible in our force When provoked by this level of barbarism we will bear any suffering pay any cost go to any length in the pursuit of justice I tell you this without fear of contradiction I know my people as you I think do not What I know reassures me It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future In the days to come there will be recrimination and accusation fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again There will be heightened security misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms Well go forward from this momen t sobered chastened sad But determined too Unimaginably determined THE STEEL IN US You see the steel in us is not always readily apparent That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who dont know us well On this day the familys bickering is put on hold As Americans we will weep as Americans we will mourn and as Americans we will rise in defense of all that we cherish So I ask again What was it you hoped to teach us It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred If thats the case consider the message received And take this message in exchange You dont know my people You dont know what were capable of You dont know what you just started But youre about to learn RFC header ReturnPath Received from relaysancerfnet by mailcampagnecom wi th ESMTP Eudora Internet Mail Server Thu Sep Received from intra fourdavoxcom
