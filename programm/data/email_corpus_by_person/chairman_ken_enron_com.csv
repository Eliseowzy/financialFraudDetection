our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and

<12606054.1075861860398.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,chairman.ken@enron.com,2001-11-09 15:48:54,Enron Announces Plans to Merge with DynegyToday we announced plans to merge with Dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings In connection with the proposed transactions Dynegy and Enron will file a joint

the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I

continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I

future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet

approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash

Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be

merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We

the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and

repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G

approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash

merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet

the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

<1916566.1075861789267.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,chairman.ken@enron.com,2001-11-09 15:52:04,Enron Announces Plans to Merge with DynegyToday we announced plans to merge with Dynegy a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

<1128228.1075861789458.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,chairman.ken@enron.com,2001-11-13 16:18:24,Change of Control ProvisionsAs many of you know I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron The merger with Dynegy or a similar transaction with any other company would trigger this provision on closing Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within months as we expect this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than million Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment Initially I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash However after talking to a number of employees this afternoon I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment Therefore at closing I will receive no payments under this provision I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enrons employees and shareholders I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry Thank you

the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed

snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed

invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be

snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and

snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and

businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash

the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G

the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we ll as our frequent updates with you The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days It will also be posted on our web site at wwwenroncomcorpinve stors under SEC Filings In connection with the proposed transactions Dynegy and Enron will file a joint

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed our existing financial vehicles including Osprey Marlin and Yosemite in further detail We told investors that we will file our Q five days late due to our current activities It will be filed on Nov We

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I

snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and

businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to

continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I

mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright

of the company Heres an update of what we discussed during the call We told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence Our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today Heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation In hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years Those include investments in Azu rix India and Brazil They have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments Because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging Weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and On top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our K filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings Weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review Core Businesses Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company Theyre our competitive advantage Th ese include Natural gas pipeline businesses Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe Retail businesses in North America and Europe and Coal businesses in North America and Europe The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability Its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in I also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns According to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships NonCore Businesses Our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision We have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses We alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year Th ey include CEG Rio a gas LDC in Brazil EcoElectrica a power plant and LN G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in India The approximately billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals Businesses Under Review These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets While sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force More information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available Credit RatingQ Filing We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating Our current cr edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows Moodys at Baa Under Review for Further Downgrade Fitch at BBB Evolving Status SP at BBB CreditWatch Negative We also discussed

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise including our market reach financial strength and industry experience Together we will be a new merchant powerhouse And again thank you for everything you have done for Enron

energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that youve worked so hard to build Following are the major components of the transaction Deal Terms The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of Dynegy shares for every Enron share For example each shares of Enron stock will be converted to shares of Dynegy upon closing plus cash for fractional shares upon closing ChevronTexaco owns approximately percent of Dynegys outstanding common stock ChevronTexaco will invest billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger Dynegy will immediately invest billion in cash in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately million shares The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals and is expected to close late next year Enron will have immediate access to Dynegys billion cash investment in Enrons Northern Natural Gas subsidiary Management of Newly Formed Company Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company which will be called Dynegy Inc and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth efficient integration The makeup of the integration team has not yet been determined The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter This merger will create an enormous growth engine providing great opportunities for our employees shareholders and customers As with any merger some elimination of positions is almost inevitable and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions Clearly we cannot rule out involuntary separation but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible As I said in my video this is a day like no other in our companys history We considered several options but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at updates If you have additional questions please submit them to mailto We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions If you receive any calls from the media please refer them to our media team at I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company Rather than closing doors we are opening new ones as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of
