<33260961.1075841080185.JavaMail.evans@thyme>,laurinh@prodigy.net,2002-01-22 01:55:34,Re What are you talking about PST IF YOU OPENED MY ATTACHMENT YOULL SEE MY BID WAS NOT Original Message From To Sent Tuesday January PM Subject RE What are you talking about I would suggest you take it up with EBay See my attachment regarding EBays policy on Non Paying Bidder I have tried to contact the person that you outbid the person that bid He has not responded I would suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm your bidding amount I would be more than willing to change your payment if the price got way out of wack is actually cheaper than some of the balls were going for this weekend I hope the person that bid will respond and get you off the hook Otherwise EBay will have to intervene on your behalf I guess it is possible their system messed up but it looks like you approved a bad bid Sorry Good luck PL NonPayingBidder Final Value Fee Credit Request Program This is your place to learn about eBays NonPaying Bidder Program and supporting features Start here if youre a Seller who
