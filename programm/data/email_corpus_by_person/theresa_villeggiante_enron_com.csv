MidwaySylmar NA NA NA NA S California Mead Palo Verde Inland SW Corners Central Rockies And the Winner Is Dayahead peak power prices in the Western US rose slightly Tuesday on revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few days The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest where heating demand was forecast to climb to abovenormal levels by weeks end Theyve got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and thats what limited the upside but that also means theres less power available from the north so our prices went up a little as well said one Southern California utility trader Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder weather draws closer but most expected the upside to be limited due to the abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices In other industry news Weil Gotshal Manges the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron reported Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron Corps energy trading business Weil plans to announce the winning bidder at its New York offices Thursday and then present the offer to the US bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday Meanwhile the court is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to Texas While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential it was reported that Citicorp Inc and UBS Warburg were among the suitors though a third financial institution that had previously expressed interest JP Morgan Chase Co declined to submit a bid by Mondays nights deadline British company BP Plc also said it may be interested in the operations and had submitted a bid of million for a small portion of Enrons assets including some back office functions and some IT assets Enrons lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids but rather an ownership stake of up to percent Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of MWh for Wednesday delivery Cooler weather forecasts were nearuniversally blamed for the rising dailies though most players conceded that healthy river flows would limit the upside The colder weather is a small blessing for sellers but also for the region as a whole The recent warm weather has caused some snowmelt something few people want to see until the spring and the lower temperatures should put a stop to that said one Northwest trader According to Weather Derivatives heating demand in the region was expected to average percent of normal Wednesday and then rise to a peak of percent of normal by Sunday Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed from a day ago coming in at kcfs through Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday and back up to kcfs next Monday and Tuesday Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather dayahead electricity prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday Gains were modest on the order of a dollar everywhere Traders cited colder temperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gas prices as the main factors leading prices higher Balance of the month is trading at a premium to the dailies which is usually a sign of coming strength said one trader Peak goods at NP were bought and sold between and MWh while the offpeak products changed hands from to MWh In political news the FERC judge for the California refund case said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July and submit his proposal to FERC by early August The state accuses energy companies of overcharging during last years energy crisis an allegation the companies deny On a less litigious note last month FERC asked the CAISO to come up with a detailed plan for reforming the states energy market The proposal could be unveiled as early as late Tuesday and would include elements of the muchadmired PJM RTO It would also emphasize a way to reduce intrazonal congestion and include a plan for a dayahead market although on a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX There were no dramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday Moss Landing MW and Etiwanda MW returned to the grid while hydro unit Big Creek Project MW was operating at MW On the weather front Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mids and lows at midstate load centers and in the highs in the south Little change was expected in temperatures through Saturday The most current sixtoten called for belownormal temperatures from January to Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than a dollar on Tuesday with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spot gas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from to MWh with the bulk of transactions seen right in the middle at MWh BalanceofJanuary contracts were heard trading at about a MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday likely in reaction to the cooler forecasts In unit news Coronado MW was in the process of restarting Tuesday afternoon as

MidwaySylmar NA NA NA NA S California Mead Palo Verde Inland SW Corners Central Rockies On the Auction Block Dayahead peak power prices in the Western US continued to fall Monday against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals While mild weather for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also lending a helping hand I dont know if prices can dip much below current levels but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on the margin and we could see some single digit prices said one marketer Temperatures were forecast to remain at abovenormal levels through the week with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to average only percent of normal through January though some cooling was expected next week Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the Northwest and California next week but temperatures are not expected to fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand said one Oregonbased trader who added And even if temperatures do fall considerably abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a minimum On the political front US Treasury Secretary Paul ONeill said Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in US regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of onetime energy giant Enron Corp I think the dust hasnt cleared yet on this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its obligations under the existing rules said ONeill of the provisions that allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron stock in retirement plans could not If they did comply with US regulations it suggests that we need rule change If on the contrary it turns out that they didnt fully comply with all the rules we have a different issue on our hands ONeill said on NBC An auction of Enrons trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday though no details had been released as of this writing We hear that there are more than the two original suitors that will be bidding on Enron which is good news for Enron traders but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced so it may be a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining the company said one source Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as MWh on Monday as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies healthy Light load goods fell by an average of MWh It was a quiet day with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation said one Northwest utility trader There were some rumors that the MW gasfired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning but confirmation was not available It wouldnt make a bit of difference anyway said one trader of the possible outage Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were slightly lower than on Friday despite recent rains but remained healthy at kcfs through Friday kcfs Saturday kcfs Sunday and kcfs next Monday Weather forecasts called for abovenormal temperatures in Portland and Seattle over the course of the week while the latest sixtoten from the NWS was calling for belownormal temperatures across the entire region from January through The sixtoten offered some longs a glimmer of hope today but its too far off to rely upon and the current over abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold snap hypothesized one market pundit With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and plenty of supply flooding the electricity market power prices settled lower across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade Players speculated on where prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out However with no cold weather on the horizon most players were pessimistic of a quick turnaround Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro They probably wont but they could commented one California trader Onpeak goods at NP and SP traded mostly flat to each other between and MWh while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers with deals heard between and MWh Light load transactions were heard mostly in the to MWh range In generation news Moss Landing MW was operating at MW on Monday The Duke unit was derated for planned maintenance Fellow gasfired generator Haynes MW was all the way offline for planned maintenance with no official cause or ETR However the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday with high temperatures expected in the mild mids to uppers The most current sixtoten called for belownormal temperatures along the coast and in Northern California with normal temperatures in the southern interior from January to Unseasonably mild weather lower spot gas prices and returning generation were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the Southwest on Monday Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as MWh while light load goods shed as much as MWh On the unit front Four Corners and MW each San Juan MW and Mohave MW were all back in service Monday morning following unplanned outages that began last week A sixtotenday forecast calling for normal temperatures in Arizona and abovenormal temperatures in New Mexico from January

warming weather this week There needs to be some sustained cold weather to give demand and prices a boost said one PJM dealer High temperatures were expected in the uppers on Tuesday before climbing into the uppers on Wednesday and lingering there through Friday The latest sixtoten from the NWS called for belownormal temperatures from January to The story was the same in the Midwest as weak demand and warmer forecasts plagued the spot market sending heavy load energy costs for Tuesday delivery lower Into Cinergy deals were done between to MWh sliding MWh on the high end No new outages were reported on Monday High temperatures were expected in the to degree range on Tuesday while the mercury was expected to climb even more by Wednesday with highs forecast to reach into the lows The most current sixtoten predicted normal temperatures from January to Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery posted mixed results in the Southeast on Monday as arbitrage between hubs sent the Entergy dailies higher and left TVA unaffected Into Entergy prices were driven up late I think some of the bidders were buying in order to sell to Southern today with transmission not difficult to come by and that hub at a premium explained one trader The heavy load product Into Entergy saw action from to MWh gaining MWh on the low end and MWh on the high Into TVA goods traded between and MWh Traders were
