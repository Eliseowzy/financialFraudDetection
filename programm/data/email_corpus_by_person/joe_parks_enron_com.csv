President imagesspacergif News item from Reuters Renewed concerns over accounting irregularities an d heavy debt burdens took their toll on the power sector on Wednesday send ing shares of independent producers and traders falling The downturn was t riggered by disclosures in The Wall Street Journal WSJ of a financing arr angement used by Dynegy Inc NYSE DYN which prompted unwelcome compariso ns to Enron as well as an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC into energy trader and pipeline operator Williams Cos NYSE WMB Analysis Just when the market conditions appeared to be stabilizing for th e recently hardhit independent power producers IPPs more unwanted bad n ews has once again plagued this sector In addition to Dynegy and Williams companies such as Calpine Mirant and AES have had significant news in the past week as the companies make moves to weather the storm of business los ses lowered credit ratings softening energy commodity prices and questio ns of accounting practices Lets take a look at the latest developments fo r these companies Dynegy shares closed at per share down by about percent as the m arket reacted to a WSJ article concerning Dynegys use of offbalancesheet transactions designed to cut tax bills and address a growing gap between c ash flow and net income Project Alpha as it was called was blessed by Dy negys former auditor Andersen and current auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Dynegy was quick to try and distinguish this transaction from the type of business practices that Enron engaged in Dynegy spokesman John Sousa emph asized The primary drivers of this transaction were that it provided us w ith a longterm source of physical gas supply and a significant tax benefit Sousa also pointed out that no related parties were involved Dynegy sto ck was not used to back the loans and the transaction was disclosed in Dyn egys financial reports last year In the company reported unrealized gains of million generated by valuing derivative contracts increasi ng the gap between its profit and cash flow Trading companies include the estimated value for derivative contracts they use for future buying and s elling of commodities in net income as unrealized gains A special purpos e entity SPE was formed in April of last year with a million loan fr om Citigroup Inc The SPE entered into gas trades with a partnership called DMT Supply LP in which Dynegy held a stake According to Dynegy during t he first nine months of operation DMT bought gas from the entity at below market prices and resold the gas at a profit But during future years of th e project scheduled to end in DMT will buy gas at abovemarket gas pr ices generating unrealized losses By arranging transactions in this manne r Dynegy was able to lower its tax bill by million But according to WSJ higher values were being assigned to derivative contracts than tho se assigned to cash transactions which creates a disconnect between repor ted net income and cash flow that investors could notice Williams shares also dropped by percent on Wednesday to close at per share on news from WSJ which reported that the SEC is looking into th e companys thirdquarter results In reaction Williams clarified that it had received a request in early February from the SEC for additional inform ation concerning the companys thirdquarter results but was told afte r a review that no financial adjustments were needed Williams spokesperso n Jim Gipson said We received an informal confidential request for infor mation by the SEC in early February about our thirdquarter Q They asked a couple of questions we responded in writing they called back in seven days and said no amendment to the thirdquarter results was required Gips on emphasized that We are not aware of any unresolved or open issues at t he SEC Williams reported a thirdquarter net income of million up from million or cents a share earned in the same quarter one y ear ago The quarter included a onetime charge of million for the comp anys investment in former subsidiary Williams Communications Group On Mar ch Williams announced it had taken a billion charge in the fourth q uarter to account for its contingent liability on Williams Communications Williams reported a loss of million for the fourth quarter Calpine shares were down percent yesterday apparently in reaction to n ews that Moodys had downgraded Calpines unsecured debt from Ba to B al ong with a negative ratings outlook Approximately billion of longte rm debt instruments are affected This follows a March report when the company disclosed that it will restate earnings after the company disc overed that emissionreduction credits it had purchased last year were not actually available In a press release Calpine said earnings would be lowered by million after tax from the million reported on Jan The restatement will drop diluted earnings per share after extra ordinary items by cents a share to Moodys sited several reasons for the ratings downgrades including Calpine s high leverage limited financial flexibility and substantial ongoing cap ital expenditure requirements to complete its reduced buildout program Ca lpines debt is expected to grow over the coming year as the company contin ues its development of committed projects While Calpines total electric s ales are expected to increase as it completes additional plants it is expe cted to be selling into unfavorable market conditions Moodys anticipated that lower spark spreads the difference between electric and fuel prices will lower in the near term Moodys warned that the negative outlook refle cts the possibility of additional downgrades should Calpines liquidity pos ition further deteriorate or its cash flow fall below expectations Calpine plans to fund completion of gasfired power projects and project expa nsions during and Moodys also assigned a Ba rating to Calpine s billion of senior secured credit facilities According to Moodys the Ba rating reflects the benefits and limitations of Calpines collateral p ackage A portion of the collateral package consists of Calpines equity in terests in Saltend and nine US power plants A principal part of the coll ateral package is Calpines naturalgas properties which may be subject to fluctuation in value based on changes in reserves and gas prices Moodys claims a portion of these gas reserves is not proven Mirant also continues to experience hard times Its shares were down p ercent to close at per share Although yesterdays downturn may have largely been driven by the overall downturn in the sector Mirant has been involved in several interesting announcements this week as it continues to try to shore up its balance sheet On April it was reported that Mirant has put its Kogan Creek power station and Wilkie Creel coal mine in Queensl and up for sale Queenslands governmentowned CS Energy currently perc ent owner of Kogan Creek is reported to be a potential buyer as are MIM a nd Macarthur Coal In a separate transaction announced on March Cleco a greed to buy Mirants percent interest in a megawatt power plant the companies are building in northeastern Louisiana The merchant power plant is owned by a joint venture between the two companies Cleco said it would assume Mirants million equity commitment and pay million to ret ire Mirants project debt Cleco said it would finance the buyout with a co mbination of new common stock and debt AES has also fallen on tough times Although the companys stock was up yes terday to close at per share the company continues to struggle Earl y this week AES sent a shockwave through the UK market when it announced its decision to put its MW Fifoots Point coalfired power plant locate d in Wales into receivership The recommissioning of Fifoots in late w as funded with a million loan arranged and underwritten by Deutsche Bank Richard Hill joint administrative receiver at KPMG in London who is charged with selling the asset says Fifoots has some GBP million of non recourse bank debt obligations as well as other liabilities that have yet to be fully determined Similar to the US market wholesale prices in the UK reportedly have collapsed by percent after the launch of last spri ngs new bilateral trading system Accordingly one report claims at least a dozen project loans are either in technical default have broken their co venants or are very close to not meeting their coverage ratio In other AESrelated news this week it was announced that GE would be purch asing AESGeners percent stake in the Servicios Integrales de Generacion de Energia Electrica Sigen services company for an undisclosed amount G E already owned percent of the joint venture AESGener controlled by AE S posted losses of Pesos mil in compared to a profit of Pesos mil in Operating results were down by percent to Pesos mil on sales declining percent to Pesos mil The performanc e of AES Argentinean subsidiaries TermoAndes and InterAndes and selling o ff the subsidiaries Central Puerto and Puerto Ventanas imposed losses Rece ntly appointed AESGener Chairman Roberto Morgan commented that the company will continue to divest in nonelectric assets and assets not based in Chil e The fallout of the Enron debacle lowered credit ratings and weak commodit y prices are providing a blow that has many energy companies on the r opes struggling to make the bell The companies are aggressively working to put up a defense by shoring up their balance sheets through asset sales p ostponing or canceling projects and taking necessary writeoffs But as qui ckly as these companies fortunes have nosedived they can rise once again Such is the fickle nature of the commodity world An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles

Wednesday Raymond James Energy Daily Update FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY Energy Price Summary Close Tuesday Oil WTI up Month Oil Futures Strip up Natural Gas HHUB up Month Natural Gas Futures Strip up Residual Oil on a MMBtu basis up London Crude Oil down so far this morning Energy Stocks Could See Weakness Over Next Month Present Buying Opportunity From a technical analysis standpoint the oilservice group looks like it will trade sideways to down over the next month On the fundamental analysis side there are no visible positive catalysts expected until July when we should see a rollover in API inventories lower natural gas injections with warmer weather and further evidence of natural gas supply declines in second quarter natural gas production data While the oil markets have typically seen builds in total petroleum inventories into July it has experienced largerthanexpected builds over the past few weeks The energy market is likely to view this as a very bearish sign We should note that a possible contributor to these abnormal builds is that Iraq was exporting as much oil as possible days ago before it cut off AprilMay exports in protest to the US and Israel Bottom line The charts and fundamentals suggest we could continue to see some weakness in both oil prices and energy stocks over the next weeks Based upon strong longerterm to month fundamentals however we believe investors should take advantage of any potential weakness over the next month and buy the stocks in anticipation of meaningful yearend upside The API reported that total petroleum inventories increased MMBbls to MMBbls for the week ended May The average consensus range called for a MMBbl draw to a MMBbl build in total inventories This build in total inventories is very bearish for the oil market Total inventories built largely as a result of much higher crude supplies as well as greater distillate supplies Total petroleum inventories are currently MMBbls above levels one year ago and continues to climb above the fiveyear average Motor gasoline inventories decreased by MMBbls to MMBbls last week and are now MMBbls above last year at this time Distillate fuel inventories rose by MMBbls to MMBbls last week Distillate inventories are now MMBbls above last year at this time US refinery operations were at a utilization rate which was higher than last weeks rate and much higher than expectations of an increase Total petroleum imports decreased slightly to MMBblsday OILSERVICE Nabors Reincorporation Receives Independent Shareholder Group Endorsement Nabors Industries AMEXNBRStrong Buy announced that Institutional Shareholder Services ISS has recommended that Nabors shareholder vote in favor of the reincorporation in Bermuda ISS is the leading independent provider of proxy analysis and voting advisory services Yesterday Nabors Chairman and CEO Gene Isenberg repeated his belief that the proposed reincorporation will result in significant tax savings and other longterm benefits for the Company that will outweigh the onetime capital gains taxes that investors will have to pay if the move is approved A lawsuit that has been filed to try to block the vote appears to be innocuous as it is not even on the court docket for a scheduling hearing until September and no motions for injunction have been filed yet A special stockholders meeting to vote on the reincorporation has been scheduled for June superscript th We currently expect that the proposal will pass the shareholder vote EP Spring Fire Stops Short of Evergreen Resources

NRONcom Sent Tuesday February PM To Proctor Shemin V Mann Kay Cc Subject FW FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Kay Mark is aware of this transaction The following is his response to Centanas counsel email I did discuss with Mark this morning the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas inplace to Centana and they would net out postpetition fees Our business people feel that we have used the storage services postpetition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense An amount equivalent to the prepetition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the prepetition amounts All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America Original Message From Mark Ellenberg ENRON Sent Friday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Mann Kay Subject Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services He is wrong on just about every point In the few instances where he has stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as of the petition date refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a violation of the automatic stay in this regard it should be noted that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the counterparty here the unstated premise of centanas position is that centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron this is wrong centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return obligation is not a debt this is clearly established in the cotton warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for section d on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential real property a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine whether to assume or reject executory contracts in addition the court has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief from the stay or adequate protection centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the estate this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages we should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards email in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to comply with enrons withdrawal requests this exposes them to breach of contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage charges based on storage actually used since december you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying postpetition administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a third party via inground transfer maybe that would work here Nemec Gerald To GeraldNemec cc

of the storage agreement also Original Message From Michael S Richards ENRON Sent Wednesday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Greg A Swidensky Subject Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Importance High Gerald this email will serve as a followup to our telephone conversation from the other day There are a number of arguments we believe we have with respect to our entitlement to prebankruptcy lease payments under our storage lease with Enron These arguments include our rights under our storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment rejectionassumption and adequate protection issues These issues are briefly addressed below Under the terms of our September Gas Storage Agreement Enron is obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of for past due lease obligations Currently Enron is past due for both pre and postbankruptcy lease obligations to us Under the terms of the lease we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due obligations including interest are paid We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law recoupment andor setoff rights We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage lease If Enron rejects our year lease we calculate the rejection damages for anticipatory breach to exceed million which is in excess of the value of the gas Recoupment rights are generally available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party against another with respect to a single indivisible contract If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to offset our claims under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the automatic stay because mutual debts may be offset against each other to achieve a just result Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group Frd nd Cir Section d of the Code requires that a debtorinpossession timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until it is assumed or rejected Therefore not only rent but also other fees taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the lease must be paid under Section d Courts have held late charges for postpetition prerejection lease payments to be obligations that must be paid as administrative expense claims See eg In re MS Freight Distribution Inc BR Bankr WD Wash We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject this contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we believe we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the exercise of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold the gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights See eg Citizens Bank v Strumpf US Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this gas with a credit against the purchase price for both pre and post bankruptcy lease obligations We believe we should seek bankruptcy court approval to the extent this involves prebankruptcy obligations This email is the property of Enron Corp andor its

handle with care Youre seen as vain selfcentered and who is extremely dominant Others may admire you wishing they could be more like you but dont always trust you hesitating to become too deeply involved with you TO POINTS Others see you as an exciting highly volatile rather impulsive personality a natural leader whos quick to make decisions though not always the right ones They see you as bold and adventuresome someone who will try anything once someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure They enjoy being in your company because of the excitement your radiate TO POINTS Others see

as kind considerate and understanding someone wholl always cheer them up and help them out TO POINTS Others see you as sensible cautious careful practical They see you as clever gifted or talented but

needs looking after who always wants someone else to make the decisions who doesnt want to get involved with anyone or anything They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that dont exist Some

Energy Daily Update Thursday AM Thursday Raymond James Energy Daily Update FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY Energy Price Summary Close Wednesday Oil WTI down Month Oil Futures Strip down Natural Gas HHUB down Month Natural Gas Futures Strip unchanged Residual Oil on a Mcf basis up London Crude Oil up so far this morning AGA reports inline injection gas prices surge show strength on cold weather forecastshort covering Last week Bcf was withdrawn from storage compared to Bcf last year and expectations for a Bcf withdrawal Total storage is now Bcf which is above last year This weeks report showed Bcfd less gas available for storage relative to last year on a weatheradjusted basis The nearmonth March futures contract showed some strength this week after the National Weather Service NWS forecasted colderthannormal weather in several key consuming regions during the next weeks Additionally short covering by traders probably added to the positive momentum The contract traded as high as MMBtu this week before slipping to MMBtu after the AGAs report To reach Bcf of gas in storage by the end of the traditional withdrawal season approximately Bcfweek would have to be pulled from storage on average over the last six weeks This compares to approximately Bcfweek withdrawn during the same period last year under normal temperatures As a result of the NWSs forecast is accurate we could still hit the Bcf mark However if weather remains warmer than normal the probability of withdrawing that much gas decreases substantially Longerterm we continue to believe that natural gas fundamentals will be a supply driven equation Based on fourth quarter production volumes reported so far it appears that US natural gas production will in fact show both sequential and yeartoyear declines Despite the potential for nearterm weakness in prices we remain bullish on the intermediate and longerterm fundamentals for natural gas The American Petroleum Institute API reported that total petroleum inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls for the week ended February The consensus range called for a MMBbl build to a MMBbl build This is a bullish report for the oil market Total petroleum inventories are currently MMBbls above levels one year ago Crude oil inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls last week Crude oil inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time Based on our current US crude oil demand estimate there are approximately days of crude oil inventory Motor gasoline inventories increased MMBbl to MMBbls last week Motor gasoline inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time Distillate fuel inventories decreased MMBbls to MMBbls last week Distillate inventories are MMBbls above last year at this time US refinery operations were at a utilization rate which was higher than last weeks rate Total Petroleum imports decreased to MMBblsday Despite last weeks larger than anticipated draw in total petroleum inventories the slowdown in US economic growth that was exacerbated by the September terrorist attacks has continued to weigh on demand and contribute to inventory levels that remain well above our year average OILSERVICE BJ Services Announces Another Strategic Acquisition Yesterday BJ Services NYSEBJSStrong Buy announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with OSCA Inc NASDAQOSCA for per share a premium to the preannouncement stock price This allcash deal equates to a total purchase price of roughly million and is expected to close by the end of the second calendar quarter OSCA provides a full array of completionrelated products and services including completion fluids completion tools and completion services BJ should ultimately be able to leverage the incremental products services and markets across its existing asset and customer base to yield significant pullthrough revenue opportunities down the road While it appears that BJ paid a full price for OSCA the combination makes a lot of strategic sense Following the announced acquisition we are making slight modifications to our nearterm estimates Specifically we are shaving a nickel from our existing FY estimate bringing it down to per share This is primarily due to the closing of the acquisition without significant nearterm cost savings or pull through benefits As management indicated on its conference call it expects the deal to be accretive to the FY consensus of per share by to per share Since we are already in print at we are leaving our FY estimates unchanged in order to be conservative Given the expected slight accretion to FY earnings combined with potential longerterm upside and an improving market outlook we are maintaining our Strong Buy rating and month target price of per share Tetra Technologies beats consensus by a penny and appears extremely undervalued relative to its peers Following yesterdays acquisition of OSCA by BJ Services it is even more clear now that Tetra Technologies NYSETTIStrong Buy is cheap Specifically OSCA was purchased for between x EPS or x EBITDA If we apply those multiples to TTI we come up with a value of to per share as opposed to the current price of per share The TTI story is very similar to that of OSCA only perhaps not as well known Following OSCAs acquisition there remains a chance that TTI could be taken out at some point in time although we have no reason to believe it will be soon Furthermore TTI stands a chance of gaining business as a result of this transaction Finally the company reported fourth quarter EPS of per share a penny above consensus It will host a conference call today at am ET The dial in number is Unit Corp handily beats fourth quarter earnings expectations Unit Corp NYSEUNTStrong Buy reported fourth quarter earnings of per share compared to per share in the fourth quarter of This result was ahead of the consensus estimate of per share Revenues for the quarter came in at million down approximately from last year and down from the third quarter Likewise overall operating margins were down over basis points yeartoyear to about while they were also down a like amount on a sequential basis The strong quarterly results were largely a result of strongerthanexpected dayrates utilization and margins during the quarter In fact average dayrates were down by only about to just under per day Meanwhile average realized oil and natural gas prices reflected the current softer commodity price environment with declines on a yeartoyear basis of for oil and for gas Production volumes also decreased from last year by for oil and for natural gas Despite the generally strong results drilling activity has fallen dramatically over the past couple months This drop in overall rig activity has had a significant impact on Units utilization dropping from a quarterly average of nearly rigs in Q to the current runrate of pulling dayrates down another currently Due to declines in the nearterm outlook for drilling and production combined with Units current activity indicators dayrates utilization production and commodity prices we are adjusting our quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates Accordingly we are maintaining our estimate of per share and our estimate of per share Despite the lack of nearterm visibility the improving longterm outlook causes us to maintain our Strong Buy rating with a month target price of per share based on a blended average of three valuation techniques Conrad Reports Very Disappointing Quarterly Loss Conrad Industries NASDAQCNRDStrong Buy reported its fourth quarter of a loss of per share compared to a profit of per share in the fourth quarter of This results missed the consensus estimate by per share Revenues for the quarter came in at million which was down from this same quarter last year and down from last quarter The gross margin for the quarter was which was down over basis points from the year ago period and down almost basis points sequentially The backlog at quarterend stood at million down from the fourth quarter of but up from last quarter The Company blamed the poor quarterly performance on weakness in the economy and offshore oil and gas industry The

combined company will have a dominant position in North America with interests in western Canada the US Rockies offshore Eastern Canada and the Gulf of Mexico as well as million undeveloped acres along the Rocky Mountain Fairway from southern Colorado to Alaska EnCana will also have large international growth engines in Ecuador and the North Sea Our target price of C US is based on a x multiple of cash flow a valuation comparable to that of its super independent peers We reiterate our Strong Buy rating Pure Posts Stronger Than Expected Q Results Reduces Capital Budget for Pure

same period last year including acquisitions made during and up for the full year However the company lowered volume guidance from growth to growth based on a reduced capital spending program As a result we have lowered our earnings estimate from to per share to reflect the reduced expectations Additionally we are initiating EPS and CFPS estimates of and respectively based on production growth from to and average commodity prices of Mcf of gas and Bbl of oil The Company replaced of its production from all sources at a cost of Mcfe and increased its total reserves by to Bcfe We are

Arkoma and San Juan Basins as well as the East Texas Freestone and Bossier Trends For an EP company XTO has a largediverse asset base substantial project inventory and multiple productive zones in its

following is his response to Centanas counsel email I did discuss with Mark this morning the current course we are following with Centana and he agreed it made sense As it stands now we would sell all the gas inplace to Centana and they would net out postpetition fees Our business people feel that we have used the storage services postpetition and consequently those fees would be an administrative expense An amount equivalent to the prepetition fees would be held in escrow until the bankrutpcy court resolved the prepetition amounts All remaining amounts would be delivered to Enron North America Original Message From Mark Ellenberg ENRON Sent Friday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Mann Kay Subject Re FW Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services He is wrong on just about every point In the few instances where he has stated correct legal principles he has misapplied them the bankruptcy code expressly cuts off interest on unsecured claims as of the petition date refusing to act under the contract unless prepetition debt is paid is a violation of the automatic stay in this regard it should be noted that obligations maturing postpetition are still prepetition debts to the extent they arise from a prepetition contract such as here both set off and recoupment require that there be a debt owed to the debtor by the counterparty and a debt owed by the debtor to the counterparty here the unstated premise of centanas position is that centanas obligation to return gas is a debt owed by it to to enron this is wrong centana is merely a bailee of the gas and its return obligation is not a debt this is clearly established in the cotton warehouse cases i have previously sent you the cites for section d on its face only applies to leases of nonresidential real property a gas storage agreement is obviously not such a lease the court has already ruled that enron deserves time to determine whether to assume or reject executory contracts in addition the court has ruled that parties to executory contracts are not entitled to relief from the stay or adequate protection centana should be placed on notice that they are violating the stay by demanding prepetition debt and by refusing to turn over property of the estate this exposes them to a contempt citation and damages we should thank them for providing a smoking gun in the form of richards email in addition they are in breach of contract for refusing to comply with enrons withdrawal requests this exposes them to breach of contract damages claims based on the decline in the value of gas they are entitled to be paid as an administrative expense for storage charges based on storage actually used since december you should be aware that we resolved a similar standoff with ngpl by agreeing to immediately reject storage contracts and paying postpetition administrative storage charges if they cooperated in the sale of gas to a third party via inground transfer maybe that would work here

storage I will forward a copy of the storage agreement also Original Message From Michael S Richards ENRON Sent Wednesday February AM To Nemec Gerald Cc Greg A Swidensky Subject Gas Storage Agreement with Duke Energy Field Services Importance High Gerald this email will serve as a followup to our telephone conversation from the other day There are a number of arguments we believe we have with respect to our entitlement to prebankruptcy lease payments under our storage lease with Enron These arguments include our rights under our storage lease agreement common law setoff rights recoupment rejectionassumption and adequate protection issues These issues are briefly addressed below Under the terms of our September Gas Storage Agreement Enron is obligated to pay monthly interest in the amount of for past due lease obligations Currently Enron is past due for both pre and postbankruptcy lease obligations to us Under the terms of the lease we are authorized to suspend withdrawals until all past due obligations including interest are paid We believe that under Texas law we are entitled to common law recoupment andor setoff rights We dont know whether Enron intends to accept or reject our storage lease If Enron rejects our year lease we calculate the rejection damages for anticipatory breach to exceed million which is in excess of the value of the gas Recoupment rights are generally available to determine a just liability on the claim of one party against another with respect to a single indivisible contract If recoupment is not available setoff enables us to offset our claims under the lease against Enrons claims for the gas subject to the automatic stay because mutual debts may be offset against each other to achieve a just result Official Comm of Unsecured Creditors v Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co In re Bennett Funding Group Frd nd Cir Section d of the Code requires that a debtorinpossession timely perform all of its obligations under an unexpired lease until it is assumed or rejected Therefore not only rent but also other fees taxes and attorneys fees to the extent provided for under the lease must be paid under Section d Courts have held late charges for postpetition prerejection lease payments to be obligations that must be paid as administrative expense claims See eg In re MS Freight Distribution Inc BR Bankr WD Wash We believe that we are entitled to the setting of an early deadline by the court for Enron to determine whether or not to accept or reject this contract in order to protect our recoupmentsetoff rights and we believe we are entitled to relief from the automatic stay to permit the exercise of the setoff rights if recoupment should be found not to apply Pending such determinations we believe that we are entitled to hold the gas to preserve our recoupmentsetoff rights See eg Citizens Bank v Strumpf US Our preference is to work out a deal with Enron for the purchase of this gas with a credit against the purchase

ChevronTexaco Corp NYSE CVX qscvxdt News nccvxhtml faces nothing but unsavory options over its downtrodden investment in Dynegy Inc NYSE DNY qsdnydt News nddnyhtml such as swallowing a huge loss and walking away or increasing its entanglement with the troubled energy trader The deep pockets of the secondlargest US oil company could ensure the survival of Dynegy the Houstonbased power trading company reeling from regulatory probes fears of possible credit rating downgrades and a stock in freefall But ChevronTexaco might cut its losses or it may sit tight and hope Dynegy can recover from a spiral that eerily resembles the demise of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp Other OTC ENRNQPK qsenrnqpkdt News neenrnqpkhtml ChevronTexaco is between a rock and a hard place said Fadel Gheit an oil analyst at Fahnestock Co After all this are they just going to put in additional money to bail out Dynegy San Franciscobased ChevronTexaco said it has a vested interest in Dynegys success but declined to comment on any possible actions it might take The company owns percent of Dynegy a stake that has lost nearly threequarters of its value since Dynegy offered to take over Enron in November Speculation that ChevronTexaco may have to pump more money into the company comes as Dynegy has been forced to put up as much as million in collateral for energy transactions over the past week even as US and European energy traders have scaled back business with the company Already Dynegys credit rating is in danger of falling to junk levels Credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service has put Dynegys credit rating in on review while rival credit agency Standard Poors has placed Dynegys short and longterm credit ratings on CreditWatch If Dynegy is downgraded to junk theyll have to raise considerable equity and my guess is the only source of that equity is ChevronTexaco said Gene Gillespie an analyst with Howard Weil Labouisse Dynegy shares fell cents or percent to an almost threeyear low of ChevronTexacos stock has not been rocked by the power trading sectors woes Its shares rose or percent to BOARDS ROLE Dynegy is also the subject of several probes including one by the SEC into a natural gas deal Project Alpha that cut the companys tax bill by million Another probe is looking into wash trades intended solely to boost trading volumes ChevronTexacos silence since Dynegys troubles have come to light has worried analysts When credit rating agency Standard Poors placed Dynegys short and longterm credit ratings on CreditWatch last week it said it was concerned about the lack of any public statement of support from ChevronTexaco in this period of market tumult for Dynegy If the situation deteriorates I would not be surprised if ChevronTexaco might have to take over Dynegy said James Elliot a portfolio manager with Dominick Dominick Advisors Also at issue is how much ChevronTexaco might have known about the various trades under investigation Three ChevronTexaco executives sit on Dynegys board including Chief Financial Officer John Watson It would be more of a disaster if an investigation revealed that the board was aware of what Dynegy was doing said Gheit I hope not because that would reflect very poorly on ChevronTexaco He added that bailing out Dynegy would be the biggest disaster because now ChevronTexaco would inherit all the potential liabilities of Dynegy The creditors and government agencies that saw Enron slip out of their fingers will go after ChevronTexaco Chevron acquired the stake in before its merger with Texaco when Dynegy precursor NGC Corp bought Chevrons natural gas business ChevronTexaco has the option to increase its stake in Dynegy to percent by redeeming billion in convertible preferred shares in the company It acquired those shares last year to facilitate Dynegys planned purchase of Enron Additional reporting by Janet McGurty and Paul Thomasch in New York Email this story
